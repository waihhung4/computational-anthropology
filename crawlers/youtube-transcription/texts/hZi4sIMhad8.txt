Scattered across the vast expanse
of China's landscape lies a forgotten piece of our history. Hundreds of massive
megalithic structures, all showcasing the uses
of advanced technology, hint at the existence of a large
and sophisticated civilization that thrived
in what is now known as China. An ancient civilization
that carved enormous stone blocks weighing over 1,000 tons, constructed over 200 pyramids
across vast areas, extracted thousands of tons of stone
to create enormous cave networks with the help
of advanced technology, and much much more. This ancient society, replete with
sophisticated technology, monumental architecture,
and profound knowledge, vanished in the blink of an eye most likely due to
a massive global cataclysmic event. This enigmatic civilization, which predates
our established historical records, challenges our understanding
of human history and begs the question: What secrets lie buried
beneath the ancient soil of China? Join us as we unravel
the mysteries of this unknown
advanced civilization, exploring the remnants
of their existence and piecing together the puzzle
of their sudden disappearance. The Yangshan Quarry, located in the outskirts
of Nanjing, China, is a trove of
archaeological anomalies that defy conventional understanding
of ancient engineering. The centerpiece of this mystery is the gargantuan megalithic block
estimated to weigh 16,000 tons, making it the largest known stone
ever cut by human hands. To put the enormity of this block
into perspective, it is over 13 times heavier than the largest known
megalithic block in the world, the one at Baalbek, Lebanon, which weighs 1,200 tons. The logistics of cutting,
extracting, and transporting a stone of this magnitude
are staggering to consider. With our current
technological capabilities, moving a 16,000-ton block
would be an impossible task, not matter how many cranes
and other heavy machinery we use. So the question is, what kind of technology
did this ancient civilization possess to be able to transport
such enormous stone blocks? And it's evident that the massive
stone block at the Yangshan Quarry wasn't an isolated case. It appears that millions of tons of rock
have been displaced already, leaving towering flat walls that defy
traditional quarrying practices. This means that indeed
whoever operated in this quarry really had the ability and technology to transport the massive blocks
that were extracted. But that's not the only mystery. The methods used
to cut and shape this giant stone are also a source
of significant wonder. There are massive square holes
at the bottom of the block, which were probably made to be used
when the block was about to be lifted and transported away from the site. The precision and clarity
of the quarry marks, along with the planned
smooth surfaces present at the site, indicate a level
of sophistication that seems far beyond the capabilities
of ancient civilizations as we understand them. The presence
of straight and precise grooves, along with the sheer size
of the block, implies a mastery over stone
that was simply impossible for any known
ancient civilization of the time. Also, the erosion and weathering
present on the stone block indicate that it's extremely old, probably much older
than the estimated 8,000 years. It seems as if the entire site
was once some kind of complex, as there are other
massive structures present there. On one of those structures, we can see perfectly squared cavities
carved into the rock, which is a task that would be
impossible with simple bronze tools. The precision
of the 90-degree angles and the intricate removal
of material from these blocks perplex modern researchers. The most shocking feature
of the structures was the giant knobs. Ancient megalithic sites
adorned with distinctive knobs are found across
various parts of the world, suggesting a shared technique
or symbolic significance among prehistoric builders. In Peru, particularly in areas like Cusco, there are many megalithic stones
with similar knobs. The Giza Plateau in Egypt, home to the famous pyramids, also features megalithic blocks
with knob-like protrusions. The Menkaure pyramid, in particular, showcases this characteristic. Mainstream historians
believed these knobs were used for the lifting
and positioning of stones, acting as leverage points for ropes. However, judging by the enormous scale
of the blocks in Yangshan, it's clear that there was
an alternative purpose behind these protrusions. But how is it possible that we can find
gigantic unfinished stone blocks in various parts of the world, all suddenly left in the middle
of their extraction processes and untouched
for thousands of years? We already mentioned the massive
stone blocks at Baalbek, Lebanon. The Trilithon
are three massive stones that form part of the podium
of the Temple of Jupiter. Each stone weighs
an estimated 800 tons. The true age of this
gigantic megalithic platform remains a mystery to archaeologists, although many believe
they are at least 9,000 years old. The ancient Phoenicians,
Greeks, and Romans built their structures and temples
upon the massive foundation, yet nothing of their construction matches the sheer scale
and engineering prowess demonstrated by the Baalbek stones. These colossal blocks
were precisely cut and placed
with remarkable accuracy and fitted together perfectly. Adjacent to these, there lies
an even larger stone block, known as
the "Stone of the Pregnant Woman," lying in a nearby quarry. For unknown reasons,
the stone was abandoned. The methods used
in the transportation and assembly of these stones continue to baffle
historians and engineers alike. Curiously,
the Yangshan Quarry in China has the exact same toolmarks that are seen
on the massive stones at Baalbek. Similarly, at the ancient city
of Petra in Jordan, toolmarks that closely resemble
those on the Yangshan blocks have been identified. Petra, dating back to
as early as 7000 BC, showcases sedimentary
rock formations with striations nearly identical
to those in Yangshan despite the different rock types. Comparisons with modern machinery reveal striking similarities
in the striations produced by contemporary mining equipment, which suggests
a level of sophistication in ancient tooling methods
that parallels modern technology. This raises intriguing questions about the capabilities
and technologies of ancient civilizations, suggesting
that they might have possessed advanced engineering knowledge long before
it was previously thought. More abandoned quarries
can be found in Egypt, precisely the Aswan quarry, in which we can find
this gigantic piece of granite, which measures
an impressive 137 feet in length and weighs about 1,170 tons. The surface
of this massive granite slab is adorned with smooth,
hollowed-out areas, giving the appearance
that the granite was "scooped out" from the obelisk. Another gigantic unfinished block
can be found at the Minya Quarry, also known as
the Tura limestone quarry, which is also in Egypt. The block at Minya remains in situ, partially carved
from the limestone bedrock, indicating that
the work was abandoned before it could be completed
and transported. The sudden cessation of work
at these sites hints at a possible cataclysmic event that abruptly ended
these monumental projects. The commonality
of unfinished work at these sites has led some to theorize that a widespread ancient cataclysm might have caused
the sudden abandonment of these monumental
construction projects. It appears
that these advanced civilizations were abruptly halted in their tracks, leaving behind
these massive stone giants as silent witnesses
to their erstwhile grandeur and technical prowess. In 1992, a remarkable discovery
was made in Xiuning, a small village
nestled in the Zhejiang Province in eastern China. This area, characterized
by its simple farming lifestyle and the picturesque banks
of the Qu River, harbored a secret
beneath it's mountain. The mountain,
though not particularly grandiose, held an array of peculiar ponds, many of which
were strikingly rectangular, hinting at an unusual origin. These ponds
were always filled with water for as long as anyone can remember, and the local farmers
regularly used the water from them. With generations of farmers
using the mysterious pits without the water ever drying up, the ponds became known locally
as the "bottomless ponds", and were steeped in curiosity that extended beyond the oldest
memories of the village elders. The name was well-deserved, as the depths of these ponds
seemed immeasurable. Generations of villagers
had attempted to gauge their depths using long bamboo poles, yet all such efforts proved futile, as the bottom
was never felt by anyone. Strangely, there was even
fishes of various sizes living in the waters of the ponds. In the summer of 1992, the mystery of these ponds
deepened when a villager, during a routine fishing endeavor, caught a fish of extraordinary size – over 30 pounds – from one of these
seemingly modest water bodies. This catch was significant
not just for its size but for the questions it raised about
the true nature of the pond's depths, where such a large fish
could grow and thrive. The villager
who made this remarkable catch was already known
in the community for his curiosity and previous attempts to explore
the depths of these ponds. Spurred by this discovery, he was determined to unravel
the mystery of the bottomless ponds once and for all. To achieve this,
he needed to do something drastic: drain the pond to reveal its secrets
once and for all. Convincing three other villagers
of the need to explore the unknown, they pooled their resources
to acquire a water pump, embarking on an ambitious project
that would challenge the myths of their ancestors. On June 9, 1992, they began the formidable task
of draining one of the ponds. They operated the pump
continuously, working day and night in shifts, driven by a shared anticipation
of the unknown. After five days of non-stop pumping, the water level had receded enough
to reveal the first clue that this was no ordinary pond. To their astonishment, a set of stone stairs
emerged from the receding waters, descending into the depths. This initial discovery was a moment
of revelation and wonder. Realizing the significance
of their find, the villagers decided
to intensify their efforts. They acquired
four more water pumps, dramatically increasing
their capacity to remove the water. For 17 days, they continued
their relentless endeavor, watching as the water level
slowly dropped and the full extent of their discovery
began to unfold. What they found
was nothing short of monumental. As the final remnants
of water drained away, they stood before the entrance
to a vast, man-made cave. The "pond" that had long intrigued
and sustained their community was, in fact, a skylight or rooftop entrance to a massive ancient
subterranean complex. This discovery challenged
everything the villagers knew about their surroundings and history. The Longyou Caves, as they would come to be known, represented a marvel of ancient
engineering and craftsmanship. In total, there were 24 caves. 14 of these caves were collapsed, but those that were intact
all showcased perfectly flat floors and ceilings angled
at a precise 45 degrees. Although the caves
were not interconnected, they were still all aligned,
with their floors on equal levels. In fact, there were caves that were made
one next to the other, separated by as little as 20 inches,
or 50 centimeters. How is such precision possible? The caves themselves
were enormous, with vast chambers
carved out of solid rock extending deep into the earth. The precision of the carvings, the smoothness of the walls, and the sheer scale of the excavation suggested a level
of sophistication and organization that was unheard of in the annals
of ancient Chinese history. The caves' design was both
intricate and functional, with channels and pools that
indicated a complex understanding of hydraulics and water management. Despite their ancient origins, the caves had withstood
the test of time, remaining structurally sound
and largely free of debris or sediment, which added
to the mystery of their purpose and the identity of their creators. Another mystery is the fact
that there is no evidence of smoke residue
on the walls or ceilings. So how did they illuminate the caves
while they were working on them? Spanning an average
of 11,000 square feet each, and soaring up to heights
equivalent to a ten-story building, these caves collectively cover
an area akin to three and a half city blocks. Estimates suggest
that without advanced technology, carving these
would have taken centuries, excluding the time needed
for the intricate chiseling and decorative work
that adorns the caves. Such a massive undertaking
hints at imperial sponsorship, yet, remarkably, these caves
were not known to history. Despite China's
long-standing tradition of meticulous record-keeping, not a single account
of these caves' construction has been found in ancient texts. The caves also present
a fascinating aspect in the form
of the marks on their walls. These marks are notably
identical and consistent. All of them are perfectly uniform
and are all set at a 60-degree angle. This led many to believe they were made by
some sort of advanced technology. Intriguingly, these marks closely mimic those
produced by contemporary machinery, leading to comparisons with the patterns left
by modern drilling equipment. When the marks
in these ancient Chinese caves are compared to those made
by our current drilling machines, the resemblance is uncanny, almost identical in nature. This raises the provocative question: did the creators of these caves possess technology
akin to what we have today? Calculations suggest that
the construction of the Longyou Caves would have involved the removal
of millions of cubic meters of rock. Given the average density
of sandstone, which is around
3 tons per cubic meter, the total weight of the excavated
material would be monumental, easily amounting to millions of tons. - One of the things that's baffling is that there's no evidence
of their construction. One of the other things
that mystifies them is that there isn't any evidence
of the people that built these caves; there's no villages
or cemeteries or work areas. Over a million metric tons of stone
were removed from those caverns, but when archeologists
go around the area, they can't find any of it. - Such a massive quantity of rock would have left
a significant mark on the landscape, creating large mounds of debris akin to the spoil heaps associated
with modern mining operations. Yet, the region around the caves shows
no sign of the massive piles of rock that would be expected from
such extensive quarrying activity. But these 24 caves
are not the only ones that possess all of these traces
of advanced technology. In fact, there are thousands
of similar caves all across China. If we go 100 miles north, we can find the Huashan Grottoes. Located near the Yellow River, these grottoes
comprise of 36 caves, each exhibiting
a sophistication and precision that echo the bewildering
characteristics of the Longyou Caves. The grottoes
are an architectural marvel, with their vast interiors, intricate passageways,
and detailed carvings. The sheer size of the excavation
project for the Huashan Grottoes is staggering. Similar to the Longyou Caves, the amount of rock removed
to create these spaces is monumental, yet, just as mysteriously, the debris from this massive
excavation is nowhere to be found. Estimations of the total volume
of rock removed to form the Huashan Grottoes
run into millions of cubic feet, a feat that would require
a well-organized workforce and a sophisticated understanding
of engineering principles. Without advanced technology, carving these
would also have taken centuries till they were fully finished. Yet, no historical records
or documents have been found that shed light on the construction
of these grottoes, their purpose, or the civilization that built them. Many parts of these caves
are still unexplored. Another place where we can see
the strange machine marks is the Hejin City Fortress. Situated atop a lofty loess slope, this mysterious fortress
is cleverly concealed by deep gorges, rendering it almost invisible
to the untrained eye. Even local residents have scant
knowledge of its historical origins. It was only through the guidance
of an 80-year-old local named Hou Jun'e that the significance and design
of the fortress came to light. His familiarity with the area was key in uncovering the pathways
leading to this historic site. Inside the Hejin City Fortress, the land opens up, reminiscent of an ancient ark. The fortress once housed
cave dwellings on its flanks. These have since eroded, leaving behind only
the plateau and its gate. Upon its discovery, the initial theory
proposed by historians was that the local villagers, described as primitive farmers
without any means of defense, constructed the fortress
as a refuge from bandits. This narrative, however, raises more questions
than it answers, particularly regarding the fortress's
grand architectural features, notably its 30-foot massive doorway that can be visible
from a large distance. The scale and complexity
of Hejin City Fortress's construction seem to contradict the idea
of it being merely a hideout. Like with the previous caves
we discussed, the cave in Hejin
is also not formed by nature but carved meticulously from the rock. Judging by the marks, it was most likely carved with the same technology
used in the other caves. Another mysterious place
is the Guyaju Caves, often referred to as
China's largest cliff dwelling. Discovered in 1984, this extensive cave complex
comprises 117 caves and 350 chambers, sprawling across 25 acres
or 100,000 square meters, making it a monumental testament
to ancient ingenuity and craftsmanship. Located about 50 miles
northwest of Beijing, the Guyaju Caves
are hewn from solid granite, a feat that underscores
the advanced technical skills and persistent labor of their creators. On the surface of the granite,
we can see once again the exact same marks
found in other megalithic structures. The mystery deepens
with the absence of dateable archaeological evidence and the lack of historical records
mentioning the site, leaving experts puzzled
about the origins, purpose, and the people behind
this architectural marvel. The Guyaju Caves resemble
a honeycomb of rock-cut chambers organized into what appears to be
two distinct village clusters. The design of these chambers, varying from square and rectangular
to circular shapes, with single to multiple rooms
across different levels, mirrors the cave dwellings
found in regions like Turkey, Italy, and Spain. The presence of doorways,
windows, king bed stoves, flues, lamp stands,
and storage compartments – all carved from stone – illustrates a high level
of domestic sophistication. The architectural design
also incorporates advanced drainage systems, highlighting
the builders' understanding of environmental management
and sustainable living. The structural dimensions
of the caves, with consistent wall thickness
and varied chamber sizes, along with the compact layout
resembling multi-story buildings, demonstrate advanced architectural
and engineering capabilities. The site had stone staircases, ladders, and bridges, while the roofs had chiseled slots
on them to collect rainwater. The "Guantangzi,"
or Golden Temple, the largest structure
within the complex, is particularly noteworthy. Consisting of eight chambered rooms
over two floors, it contains finely carved stone pillars, a large central bed, and stone furniture, leading some to believe it was
the residence of the community's leader or a place of worship. Despite over three decades
of protection and study since their discovery, the origins, purpose, and ultimate fate
of the Guyaju Caves' inhabitants remain a mystery. Archaeological estimations
date the site to between
1,000 and 2,000 years ago, but these are speculative, and many believe
the site is much more ancient. Judging by all of these
sophisticated structures, we can agree that there was
some kind of lost civilization that lived in China
thousands of years ago. But are there any other clues left
by this mysterious culture? In 1986, construction workers
in the city of Guanghan stumbled upon
an archaeological marvel that unveiled the remnants
of a long-lost civilization. The discovery of two sacrificial pits brimming with hundreds of artifacts, including bronze and gold masks, statues, figurines,
and exquisite marble and jade items, marked a significant breakthrough
in the study of ancient Chinese history. Historians have since
dated these findings to between 3,000 and 5,000 years ago, situating them
at the dawn of civilization, a time corresponding with the ancient
Sumerian and Egyptian civilizations, who are one of the first on Earth. This lost civilization
became known as the Sanxingdui, with the name meaning
"the three-star mounds at the ruins". In total, there were
13,000 artifacts unearthed, including over 1,200 bronze wares, 543 gold artifacts, and 565 jade objects. Among the highlights of the discovery
is a bronze box with a tortoise-shaped lid, dragonhead handles
and bronze ribbons. Other key finds include
a bronze sacrificial altar, a giant bronze mask, and a bronze statue with
a human head and a snake's body. The giant mask was incredible, measuring around
four and a half feet in width, or one and a half meters, and two and a half feet in height,
or 75 centimeters. Another incredible artifact
was this large bronze statue, which is around 9 feet tall
or more than two and a half meters. In the center of each
of the figure's hands, there are cylindrical holes which
indicate that it once held something. All of the bronze heads
discovered among the relics are particularly striking, characterized by
their oversized eyes and ears. Many believed that this civilization didn't even belong
to the Chinese culture at all, as the Chinese civilizations
never made any artifacts remotely similar to those. All of the mysterious artifacts
were very unique and presented
a sophisticated artistry. Strangely, many of them were damaged
and had burn marks. This means they were either
deliberately damaged, burned and then buried, or perhaps were left by a civilization that was destroyed by a cataclysmic
event that led to this destruction. The masks and statues
of this culture are distinct not only for their
atypical facial features but also for the level of craftsmanship
and complexity they exhibit. To create such detailed
and exquisite artifacts, you had to be advanced
in metallurgical skills, which is quite astonishing
for a civilization that existed
at least 5,000 years ago. Whoever these people were, their abrupt disappearance remains one of the greatest
historical enigmas. But perhaps
the greatest mystery of all are the pyramids
that can be found all across China. The Chinese Pyramids, concealed for centuries, remain relatively unknown globally, including within China. These ancient structures
dot China's central plains and deserts, predominantly in Shaanxi Province. Yet, the Chinese
communist government has imposed strict prohibitions
on excavating and even visiting
these ancient edifices. The local farmers
living near the pyramids are encouraged to plant threes
on the pyramids to conceal them. With over 200 pyramids discovered, their true purpose and origin
remain a complete mystery, obscured not only
by physical barriers but also by
governmental restrictions. The first recorded mention
of these pyramids in the West dates back to 1912, when travel agent Fred Meyer Schroder
reported their existence, noting that there are
massive pyramids there. However,
it wasn't until the mid-20th century that these structures
gained significant attention. During World War II, American pilot
James Gaussman flew over the area and captured photographs
of these structures. But it wasn't until the advent
of satellite imagery that we were able to understand
the true scale and number
of these Chinese pyramids. Similar to pyramids
elsewhere in the globe, the Chinese pyramids
are precisely oriented, with their corners perfectly aligned
to Earth's cardinal directions. In terms of astronomy, they are slightly misaligned
from the Gemini constellation, aligning almost exactly
during the spring equinox several millennia ago. This slight deviation of 14 degrees can be explained by
the axial precession of the Earth, a phenomenon where
the planet's axis slowly wobbles, completing a full cycle
approximately every 25,700 years. This means that these pyramids could be
tens of thousands of years old. Another incredible similarity
and cosmic alignment can be found
when you compare the layout of the pyramid complex
of Teotihuacan in Mexico, with the Giza complex in Egypt, and with
the Xián Pyramid complex in China. All three sites are structured
in almost the exact same way and mirror the Orion constellation. How is this possible, considering all three of them
are on different continents, separated by thousands of miles? Moreover, all three pyramid complexes
are aligned in a near-straight line, having the same orientation. Was this just a coincidence? Or is there more to this story? The remarkable presence
of Chinese pyramids, particularly the colossal
Great White Pyramid located in the valley
of Shaanxi Province is considered by many
the largest pyramid in the world. It's twice the size
of the Great Pyramid of Giza, with a height of around
1,000 feet or 300 meters. This means that the construction
of this gigantic pyramid would require no less
than 50 million tons of stone. Some have linked the extensive
network of caves discussed earlier with the massive pyramids
in the area. As we discussed before, the stone extracted
from all of these caves was never found
anywhere in the area. This situation leads to speculation that the large amount of stone
taken from these caves might have been employed in building the numerous pyramids
throughout China, specifically the Great White Pyramid. Additionally, the gigantic stones
extracted from the Yangshan Quarry could also have been used
for the construction of all of these pyramids. The most famous site in China, the Terracotta Army, is also built right at the edge
of a massive pyramid that is still unexcavated. Discovered in 1974
by local farmers digging a well, the Terracotta Army encompasses
more than 8,000 soldiers, along with chariots, horses, officials, acrobats,
strongmen, and musicians, each with unique facial features
and expressions, suggesting they were modeled
after real individuals. The figures are life-sized
and were originally painted, although much of the paint
has flaked away over the centuries. The Terracotta Army
was part of a larger necropolis designed to mirror
the urban plan of the capital city and served to protect the emperor
Qin Shi Huang in the afterlife. Qin Shi Huang
is the first emperor of China, who founded the Qin dynasty. He was a monumental figure
in Chinese history, known for his conquest
that united China, the construction of the Great Wall, and the standardization
of the monetary and legal systems. Entombed for over 2,000 years, the Terracotta Army form
a massive underground mausoleum, the construction of which
involved 700,000 workers and artisans over several decades. The site was a four-layered
subterranean city, at the center of which lies
one of China's greatest mysteries: the emperor's burial mound, which has not yet been excavated
due to high levels of mercury. Archaeologists believe
that beneath this mound lies a chamber
with Qin Shi Huang's remains, surrounded by
a miniature cosmic model. The tomb is thought
to replicate the universe, with the ceiling
representing the night sky, adorned with pearls as stars, and the ground mimicking
the landscape of China, where flowing mercury
symbolizes the rivers. Considering how fascinating
this site is, just imagine
what secrets could be found inside the pyramid adjacent to it, which is most likely thousands of years
older than the Terracotta Army itself. - Within the pyramid
is a lake of mercury, that there are
mechanical devices in there which will fire arrows at you
if you go in. There's a whole story
about how intensely protected it is, and up to this day,
it's not been excavated. - The mystery surrounding
the Chinese pyramids extends far back in history, with documented references
to these structures dating back to the early 17th century. Notably, a Roman Jesuit, whose observations
have been preserved in various historical accounts, penned some of the earliest
Western descriptions of these remarkable constructions. However, it was Joseph de Guignes, a renowned French orientalist
and sinologist in the 18th century, who significantly contributed
to the discourse with his provocative theory. In his 1785 publication, 'An Essay in Which We Prove
The Chinese Are an Egyptian Colony,' de Guignes posited
a direct connection between the Chinese
and ancient Egyptians, largely based on the presence
of pyramid-like structures in China, along with certain cultural
and linguistic similarities, indicating a possible historical link
between the two civilizations. But the architectural features
of these structures do not resemble
just the pyramids in Egypt but those in South America. There's an interesting site
known as the Guanlin Temple, located near Luoyang
in the Henan Province. This site is steeped
in history and reverence, primarily known as the tomb
and memorial complex for Guan Yu, a famous general
in Chinese folklore and history. While the temple serves
as a commemorative site, its architectural features and the age of some structures
within the complex suggest a much older origin, potentially predating the commonly
accepted historical timelines associated with the temple. Many believe the ancient Chinese
used this structure as a tomb, the same way as the ancient Egyptians
used various ancient sites in Egypt, although they were
not their true architects as these sites were way too advanced
for their bronze tools and knowledge. The Tomb of the General, located in Ji'an, Jilin province in China, is part of
the Goguryeo Tombs Complex. This pyramid structure
was most likely thousands of years older
than the Goguryeo kingdom, which used the pyramid as a tomb,
although they didn't construct it. The pyramid shape
of the Tomb of the General represents a unique
architectural style in East Asia, distinct from
the more rounded burial mounds commonly found
in other parts of China and Korea. Curiously, this pyramid
has a broad base that narrows towards the top, very similar
to the Mesoamerican pyramids built by civilizations
like the Aztecs and Mayans. The similarities are intriguing
from a comparative perspective because their builders were believed
to have developed independently on the opposite sides of the world. These similarities
are not just superficial; they extend to
the engineering techniques, the orientation and alignment
with astronomical events, and the multi-tiered design
that is characteristic of many pyramidal structures
around the world. The idea that such architectural
and engineering concepts could span across
continents and cultures suggests a potential
exchange of knowledge or a common architectural lineage
that has yet to be fully understood. Curiously, all across the world, there are ancient stories
about mythical figures that visited our ancestors and gave them advanced
knowledge and technology, kickstarting their civilization. In Mesopotamian mythology, the Apkallu were seven sages
sent by the god Enki to teach humanity
various arts of civilization, including writing, law,
temple building, and agriculture. In Mesoamerican cultures, particularly among
the Aztecs and Toltecs, there's Quetzalcoatl, a provider of agricultural knowledge who taught the ancient people
the use of metalwork, the calendar, and the cultivation of maize. In Egyptian mythology,
there was Thoth, a deity who gave the Egyptians
writing in the form of hieroglyphics, together with various
other advanced knowledge, boosting their civilization
significantly. Many researchers,
like Graham Hancock, believe these beings were survivors
of an ancient cataclysm that destroyed
the advanced civilization that constructed all of these massive megalithic monuments
across the globe. These survivors
then spread across the world and gave knowledge to the primitive
hunter-gatherer societies. Interestingly, in Chinese mythology, we can find a similar figure. The Yellow Emperor, Wang Di, is a mythic figure in Chinese history, that is often regarded as
the progenitor of Chinese civilization. His contributions to the fabric
of Chinese culture are immense, ranging from the creation
of traditional Chinese medicine, including acupuncture, to the introduction
of wooden houses, the bow and arrow, bronze coins,
and a written language. The knowledge and technologies
he gave to the ancient people were so immense that he became known
as the founder of Chinese civilization. Comparing the Yellow Emperor with other civilizational bringers
all across the world, one can discern a pattern where
these figures are often credited with introducing
critical advancements to society. All of this would essentially mean that the advanced megastructures
found all across China, were the works
of a far more ancient civilization. A civilization lost to time
and missing from our history books. One of the more controversial
discoveries in China are the so-called Baigong pipes. The enigma of Mount Baigong's
mysterious pipes remains one of the unresolved
mysteries of the past decade. In 1996, a research expedition found
around two dozen pipes with diameters
ranging from 1 to 50 inches, or 2 to 40 centimeters, embedded in the rock formations, suggesting an intricate
man-made structure. These perplexing objects have sparked
widespread media attention but have yet to be scrutinized
by rigorous scientific study. Theories about their origins
are abundant and varied, with suggestions ranging
from an ancient water system, to an advanced
lake drainage mechanism. Chemical analysis of the pipes indicated a high content
of iron oxide, alongside significant amounts
of silicon dioxide and calcium oxide. Remarkably, the artifacts were estimated
to be over 5,000 years old, predating the known advent
of iron smelting in China. Public information
about the Baigong pipes emerged in June 2002 when a Chinese newspaper published
an article claiming the discovery could challenge the entire narrative
of human history. Following this, other publications
sensationalized the pipes as remnants of
technologically advanced structures, captivating public interest. During a search for dinosaur fossils
near Mount Baigong, a group of American scientists
encountered several caves containing more peculiar objects. Among these
were two rusty iron pipes, each about 40 centimeters, approximately 16 inches in diameter. One pipe seemed to stretch
from the mountain's peak, into the cave, while the other descended
from the cave's floor, suggesting they were part of
an ancient system or mechanism. Of the three caves identified, two had collapsed, obscuring their contents. Later investigations in the area
revealed additional pipes, approximately 12, with diameters ranging
from 2 to 5 centimeters, roughly 1 to 2 inches, suggesting a complex
and extensive network. Observers have noted that the pipes
are complexly interconnected, suggesting their creators possessed
highly advanced technology. These pipes
were found near Lake Toson, about 80 meters or 260 feet
from Mount Baigong, with sizes ranging
from a few centimeters to as thin as a few millimeters, similar to a toothpick. Some of these pipes
were embedded in the lake's bottom or protruding above its surface. Despite their discovery, they have yet to attract
significant scientific scrutiny and are seldom mentioned
in academic circles. Among the conjectures is the idea that the pipes are part of an ancient
water management system, possibly linked to
a pyramid-like structure, which is speculated
to have stood 50 to 60 meters, or around 200 feet tall
on the mountain, featuring triangular shafts and wells
leading down its sides. This hypothetical pyramid
is thought to have channeled water from Lake Toson through
the complex network of pipes. Serious discussion about
the origins of the Baigong pipes necessitates a detailed
chemical examination. One of the few
to conduct such an analysis is Chinese scientist Liu Shaolin, who found that the pipes
mainly consist of iron oxides, calcium, and silicon, with about eight percent
of the materials unidentified. Liu's research suggests
that the pipes might be calcite formations or pseudomorphs, where minerals replace organic matter
like wood roots over time, akin to the fossilization process. This theory is supported by
atomic spectroscopy studies in 2003, which detected organic compounds
and growth rings, indicating the pipes
are natural formations, not artifacts of advanced technology. Despite these findings, the mystery deepened when, in 2007, the Chinese Seismological Bureau
reported significant radioactivity in some pipes, adding another layer of intrigue. If the pipes
are really natural formations, why would they have
radioactive properties? The complete story
of the Baigong pipes remains partially told, with their precise nature and origin still awaiting further exploration
and scientific inquiry. Although it's most likely
that the so-called pipes are actually just natural formations, created by ancient trees
that fell down and were calcified and fossilized, we still know for certain
that the Yangshan Quarry with its gigantic stone block, the cave networks carved
with advanced technology, and all the hundreds of pyramids
scattered across China, are all man-made construction. All of these megastructures alone
are enough for us to conclude that there really was
an advanced ancient civilization that resided in what is now China. Who this civilization was
still remains a mystery. If you want to dive into a journey
of advanced lost technology and sophisticated megastructures, you can watch
our two-hour documentary on the pre-Egyptian
artifacts and technologies in which we explore
several sites and pieces that we believe
were built by a civilization far more sophisticated
than the dynastic Egyptians. The link is in the top pinned comment.
