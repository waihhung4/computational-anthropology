for regular videos on ancient cultures and forgotten civilizations Please Subscribe if you are interested in ancient history you've probably heard of the Sumerians of Mesopotamia although they are not the first people who lived in Mesopotamia they are the earliest known ethnic group that inhabited the region the Sumerians along with the Egyptians are known for being the earliest known people to develop a fully developed writing system when I say fully developed I mean that the writing system could represent language in complete sentences the Sumerians are also known for being the ones who built beginning in the fourth millennium BCE some of the earliest cities in the world and who are the developers of the calendar and time keeping systems that we commonly use today when we use the word Sumerian we are of course referring to people who lived in the land of Sumer and who created the distinctive culture that we call sumerium but we also are referencing people who spoke the language that we call Sumerian we learned of this language when the cuneiform text of southern Mesopotamia were deciphered but a mystery that has befuddled Scholars concerns the origins of the Sumerians how long were they in Mesopotamia before writing in urban culture was developed and if they came from somewhere else where join me as we consider the puzzle of Sumerian Origins [Music] the origin of the Sumerians has been the subject of very intensive debate that began more than a century ago I suppose the first question we should ask is what is the earliest evidence for the existence of the Sumerians in southern Mesopotamia well this would be with the first appearance of texts that are written in Sumerian and there is enough inscriptional evidence to suggest that even the earliest partly syllabographic text of southern Mesopotamia this is before cuneiform were written in Sumerian and we are probably safe going as far back as the logo graphic texts that led neatly into the syllabographic texts this puts us at around 36 to 3 500 BCE but before then we have no direct evidence bearing on this question an approach taken by physical anthropologists in the 1920s and 30s was to look at human remains found in the region and see if they could identify those that were Sumerian one early view was that the Sumerians had short broad skulls whereas the Semitic people in the region had long narrow skulls the problem was that there was and still is a scarcity of well-preserved skulls to examine and so in order to bolster theories based on Bones iconographic evidence would be imported into their proposals they would look for similar imagery in the art of neighboring people compare it to their bones and draw conclusions but it soon became apparent that the iconographical representations were conventionalized throughout that part of the world and so it couldn't really be linked up to the osteological data over time as material evidence was gathered it became clear that the population of Mesopotamia was a lot more complicated than what was thought and it made the search for a Sumerian race based on Bones pointless while connecting Sumerian culture with a race has been a dead end a connection between Sumerian culture and Sumerian language is accepted by all language after all is cultural but even historical Linguistics which traces the movement of people by reconstructing the family trees of human language and which sheds light on the geographic origins of many language speakers cannot help us on this matter because the Sumerian language has no known relatives it's not Semitic it's not Indo-European efforts have been made to connect it with modern languages such as Turkish or Hungarian or Sino Tibetan but these have not been convincing because they often rely on naive comparisons of sounds and meaning without regard to grammar a more serious attempt has been made to associate it with the uralic language family but that has not gained much traction largely because of our limited knowledge of Sumerian phonology so most Scholars still consider it an isolated language now it's true that typologically Sumerian shares some grammatical features in common with some other languages such as Basque Georgian and an early language spoken in Siberia called chuchi but this doesn't really help us in determining sumerian's parentage because similar features occur independently all over the globe even the Sumerian name for their language doesn't help they called it Emma gear which simply means native tongue no one really knows where the Sumerian language came from so this will not help us to determine how long the Sumerians had been in Mesopotamia by the time their experiments in writing began here are the archaeological periods under consideration the earliest logographic texts date to the middle of the Uruk period which is the time that saw the emergence of urbanism in Mesopotamia so Scholars are generally agreed that a date just prior to 3600 is the latest possible date for the arrival of the Sumerians in the area before the urugu period and partly overlapping it was the ubaid period which is the period that the alluvial plane in southern Mesopotamia was first settled were the Sumerians there during the ubaid period Scholars are not in agreement over the most likely scenario there are three Chief hypotheses that have attractive support one is that the Sumerians were already in Mesopotamia since the beginning of the ubaid period and maybe even before and that they are among those who first settled the alluvial plane the evidence for this is mainly archaeological the archaeological record during the ubaid and early Uruk periods does not indicate any cultural change that might indicate an influx of a new group into the area the ubaid material culture appears too seamlessly and smoothly develop gradually into the Uruk material culture Temple architecture and forms of worship show continuity rather than a shift a competing hypothesis is that the Sumerians had only recently arrived in Mesopotamia when their logographic texts began to be written as evidence for this Scholars leaning towards this view appeal to the Sumerian language itself there are words in the language that appear to be foreign language words that the Sumerians adopted these words include the names of the Euphrates river which they called buranoon and the Tigris river which they called idigat and the names of several major settlements including aridu Ur Larsa istan lagash nippler and Kish this would suggest that these cities were founded before the Sumerians got there and then the Sumerians just continued to use their original names also some basic words for agriculture and agricultural tools such as the words for plow Furrow date palm farmer and basic words for urban crafts such as Potter metal worker Mason Carpenter do not appear to be Sumerian words so it seems as if the Sumerians moved into the area and learned these words from the people who were already using this technology now the argument that proponents of the first hypothesis give against this evidence is that our understanding of the growth and development of the Sumerian language before the time of writing is extremely Limited and we cannot say for certain these aren't Sumerian words those who posit a late arrival of the Sumerians do not agree on where the Sumerians came from some Scholars suggest they came by sea from the Persian Gulf and originated somewhere to the South others suppose they came from the North near the Caspian Sea yet others say they came from the direction of Iran to the east but all these are just educated guesses I found a strange research paper in the journal advances in anthropology written by a retired physician that argued that the Sumerians were so enamored of lapis lazuli that they must have come from somewhere that had an abundance of lapis lazuli and he narrowed it down to Turkmenistan this hypothesis hasn't gained any adherence that I know of probably because a society can easily fall in love with imported products they don't need to have ever lived where the product was obtained a shift in more recent times into looking at the interactions between various groups in the archaeological record has led to a third hypothesis which is that the Sumerians were an amalgamation of many groups who migrated into Mesopotamia during the ubaid and especially the early urugu period streams of immigrants coming from many directions and speaking different languages came to Mesopotamia over the course of several centuries and they gradually adopted a common culture and produced a common language in other words the Sumerians never existed outside of Mesopotamia but they also didn't exist in Mesopotamia either until a certain point this would explain why there are some words in Sumerian that appear foreign and also why the material culture shows smooth and gradual development over time what about DNA can this shed any light on the subject to date not much work on this question has been done in genetics but there was an interesting study done on the marsh Arabs these are people who had lived for a very long time in the marshes of Southern Iraq right where the Sumerians had once lived the question was were the marsh Arabs descendants of the Sumerians or were they a group that migrated into the area in later times the genetic study indicated that the empty dnas and Y chromosomes of the modern Marsh Arabs are predominantly of ancient Middle Eastern origin so they very well could be the descendants of the Sumerians moreover these people had no significant ancient Indian or Southern Asian ancestry this would indicate that the Sumerians did not come from South Asia the marsh Arabs did possess certain cultural features associated with South Asia such as water buffalo breeding and rice farming which were most likely introduced from the Indian subcontinent but as this only marginally affected their gene pool the study concludes that they did not come from South Asia its early days here on the DNA evidence so we will have to wait and see right now there is really no way to tell how long the Sumerians were in Mesopotamia or where they came from it is a mystery that may never be solved we shall see if you enjoyed this video please give it a thumbs up and if you are
