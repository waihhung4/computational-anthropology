[Music] the Sumerians were an ancient people of lower Mesopotamia who established one of the world's first civilizations that were the pioneers of urban culture creating the first cities in history while also making remarkable advances in agriculture Administration religion art and much more as one of the earliest civilizations their profound influence on the ancient medieval and modern world cannot be overstated in this video we will explore their history from beginning to end and delve into various different aspects of their culture before the emergence of the Sumerian civilization Mesopotamia was inhabited by various different peoples the Fertile Crescent which encompasses Mesopotamia witnessed the dawn of Agriculture around it 11,000 BC however the lower part of Mesopotamia remained largely unexploited until around 7200 BC when people gradually began to settle and cultivate these lands archaeologists have identified various cultures in Mesopotamia distinguished by unique Pottery Styles jewelry and figurines the southernmost among them the UB culture emerged around 5400 BC the term Ade originates from the archaeological site of tur alade excavated in the early 20th century the O people inhabited the region that would later become known as Suma the heartland of the Sumerian civilization oade culture had distinct features including Pottery adorned in Black geometrical lines and drawn on a buff colored base additionally oy figurines primarily consisted of the so-called lizard headed female statues made with clay and bitman another notable feature although not exclusive to the aade culture was the use of stamp seals the seals were utilized to Mark property seal doors or chairs and they often featured various designs depicting animals and humans in its early stages the Society of the U people was egalitarian a characteristic of many prehistoric cultures however around the middle and late sixth millennium BC a clear hierarchy began to take shape certain Elite individuals or families began to exert greater influence over agricultural practices and land ownership this transition was accompanied by the establishment of numerous new settlements some of which evolved Beyond Simple Village structures to resemble Proto towns it was during this time that settlements like arido followed by or were established eridu in particular is known for having the earliest temple in all of Mesopotamia both of these settlements would develop over thousands of years eventually becoming famous Sumerian cities in short the U people laid the groundwork for the Advent of the Sumerian civilization and the remarkable cultural and technological advancements that would define Mesopotamian culture according to archaeologists the oade period came to a close around 4,000 BC it was around this time that the Samarian civilization finally [Music] emerged people have been debating and developing theories about the origins of the Sumerians since archaeologists first discovered the civilization for decades the prevailing theory was that the Sumerians arrived in the region From A Distant land during the late fifth millenni BC bringing with them a highly Advanced culture they either displaced the local population or taught them their ways and lived alongside them even among proponents of this Theory there is debate about whether the Sumerians came from the north west east or the South Via the sea this Theory mainly stems from interpretations of myths and very limited linguistic evidence such as the presence of some Sumerian words that are not of Sumerian origin suggesting they were adopted from the previous population another theory that emerged later suggests that the Sumerians are direct descendants of the UB people with the UB culture gradually evolving into the surian culture over the centuries a third Theory posits that the Samarian civilization emerged from a blend of various peoples including those in southern Mesopotamia like the uade and neighboring regions who collectively contributed to its creation given the lack of concrete evidence Scholars must draw conclusions from limited data today most archaeologists favor the second and third theories they believed that the Sumerians were either a natural progression from the U people or a mixture of the UB and neighboring populations this is in part supported by archaeological findings such as settlements pottery and artifacts which do not indicate a complete cultural shift conquest or displacement but rather a gradual development into a more sophisticated culture this view is further supported by the fact that some of the most famous Sumerian cities were originally established by the U people and show a natural evolution in population size and culture in order to talk about the early Sumerians we must first address the landscape geography and climate of Mesopotamia as these factors were fundamental in shaping their civilization Mesopotamia climate is extremely hot and dry as it is surrounded by desert rainfall is scarce and the Region's flat terrain allows strong winds to sweep across the plains leaving the soil Aid however the two great Rivers the Tigris and the Euphrates provided essential water sources that enabled people to settle along their banks these Rivers are replenished by rain and melting snow from the tourist mountains to the north which deposit Rich silt making the river banks very furtile for agriculture but they also pose significant challenges unlike the Nile river which has a steady source of water and predictable late summer floods that allow Farmers to plant their seeds afterward the rivers in Mesopotamia were unpredictable they often cause destructive floods in early spring or broad periods of tra out due to a lack of rainwater furthermore winter often brought thick layers of M complicating farming even further another major issue was the lack of Timber Stone and minerals in Mesopotamia which are essential for a civilization to thrive so how did this challenging land become the Bedrock of the first urban civilization in the world the answer lies within the Ingenuity of the late raade and early Sumerian people in order to combat the unpredictable floods and essentially tame the rivers the people of this region developed extensive irrigation networks these networks not only allowed them to control floods but also enabled them to expand the areas they could cultivate additionally they facilitated easy movement along the rivers and irrigation canals using river boats and kuers rounded lightweight boats that were perfect for these Waters the Sumerians primarily cultivated barley due to its resistance to the heat alongside wheat they also kept a variety of domesticated animals oxen for agricultural labor sheep and goats for wool and milk pigs for meat and donkeys for transportation this region had only two types of trees dat palms and tamarisks tamarisks mainly grew on formerly cultivated soil that had become too salty for agriculture and they were primarily used for firewood date palms of the other hand thrived abundantly near the two great rivers and alongside irrigation canals often living up to 200 years the date palms served a dual purpose firstly the protein Rich date fruits and syrup were essential Staples in the Sumerian diet secondly dat Palms provided vital shade from the scorching Sun allowing the cultivation of crops such as garlic cucumber cheek peeas leaks plentils and much more in small gardens beneath their canopy it is important to note that during ancient times the landscape of this region was different from today as the Waters of the Persian Gulf extended much further Inland in the southern part of Suma the two great Rivers flooded into an extensive Delta of vast Mar es this landscape was rich and fertile for agricultural production in addition to the Abundant water from small lakes and marshes the region was populated by various species of birds and wild Wars there was also an abundance of fish along with a sizable population of water buffalos that were herded by the Sumerians for their milk the greatest benefit though was the rich source of weeds found all over the marshes which proved extremely useful unable to build houses out of rock and stone the Sumerians instead utilized the two abundant resources in their area weeds and clay from the plentiful River mod they constructed houses using baked clay bricks and stacks of bound weeds furthermore due to the scarcity of stones and metals they also used clay to make agricultural tools plates jars and pots among other things over time with all these implementations and Innovations the L toade an early Sumerian people managed to transform a semih hostile land into one of the most agriculturally fertile regions in the world the Sumerian ability to adapt to and transform the harsh environment through Ingenuity and collaboration was crucial to their success according to most Scholars Sumerian history proper begins is around 4,000 BC its first phase is known as the UK period by the beginning of the fourth millennium BC the Sumerians had already managed to produce such a great surplus of barley and wheat that they began developing an extensive trading system to export it this allowed them to import the materials that they most crucially needed they imported Timber Limestone and obsidian from Eastern Anatolia the Levant and the zagas mountains lazle and Carnelian beads from the indis valley and copper from Central Anatolia the Caucasus and modern Oman they became masters of copper smelting and production making great use of it for a variety of purposes from agricultural tools to hunting equipment it was also during this period that a significant shift in population and settlement patterns emerged settlements in northern Mesopotamia expanded as people flocked to them in the region of Suma however this trend was predominantly seen in Uruk yet uruk's expansion and Urban Development far outpaced that of the major settlements in northern Mesopotamia it was here that the first urban civilization would rise hence the name oruk period the transition from a large settlement to the world's first city was a process that took centuries to develop by 3600 BC though oruk had grown so much in size and population that it hosted between 25,000 to 50,000 people in comparison other major Mesopotamian settlements of that time had populations ranging from 3,000 to a maximum of 5,000 War's remarkable growth can be attributed to its development of a complex and extensive Canal Network these canals ran through the city connecting it to trade routs on the river and nearby farmlands making making UK an extremely rich settlement it is in Uruk that we witness the emergence of planned Urban Development for the first time public gathering areas bustling marketplaces specialized production centers and Monumental Temple districts all began to take form although the layout of streets and Alleyways was still somewhat rudimentary this marked a departure from earlier simple settlement patterns these early Urban features reflect an increasing complexity in Social organization and economic activities by around 3500 BC Oro experienced further urbanization and social stratification accompanied by the construction of a great mud brick wall around the main city the tallest in the world at that time archaeological findings reveal two primary districts within Uruk Center the first was the aana district dedicated to the Samaran goddess inana the deity of Love Divine Law and warfare this District featured two main temples the stone mosaic temple built over an earlier obeyed era Temple and the Limestone Temple of inana which was unprecedented for both its immense size and the use of limestone which was still uncommon for temple building in Sumer at that time both temples were decorated with colorful stone cone mosaics additionally this area contained many other buildings such as great Halls Courtyards and smaller temples the second was the Anu District dedicated to the Sumerian Sky god Anu or an unlike the aana district it did not feature great halls and Courtyards instead it was dominated by a single massive Temple structure the temple was built upon a large rectangular-shaped mud brick step Terrace approximately 11 M High this type of structure would later be known as a zigurat and this was the first of its kind the temple itself at this elevated height had a commanding presence it was rectangular measuring around 18x 22 M and standing 12 M tall it was constructed from mud bricks and bitumin among other materials and was covered with wide plaster giving it a striking appearance in the sunlight together the cigarette and the temple reached a combined height of 23 M both districts are an indication of the wealth and social organization of oruk at that time the temples were continually reconstructed and the oruk zigurat which can still be seen today took its final form during the early third millennium BC it is clear that the entire city was organized around these Temple districts which controlled all aspects of life the temple served as an institution encompassing religious economic and administrative functions it received Goods as taxes redistributed them to the people and offered protection behind the main City's walls in this era the temple economy relied on two distinct groups Farmers Who provided mainly wheat and barley and craftsmen who offered their goods and services this system enabled Artisans such as Potters Weavers metal workers and Stone Cutters to focus entirely on their crafts this shift from family-based production to a more organized Temple centered system marked a significant societal change and enhanced productivity and economic growth in the city it is during this time that we see the first extended use of the Porter's wheel which the early Sumerians or oby people had invented this period also witnessed the mass production of goods particularly handmade Pottery under the direction of the temple for redistribution purposes it should be mentioned that this system primarily included the people within the city walls and the immediate surroundings those living further from the temple districts in the main city were relatively independent and may have only occasionally interacted or cooperated with the centralized Temple Administration those overseeing the temple system were the priests who acted as both religious leaders and administrators responsible for organizing various products for instance one priest would oversee the storage of grain brought in by the farmers while another would manage the women working at the palace for weaving at the top of the hierarchy was what appears to be a type of priest king known as Ani serving as both leader of the priests and a central administrative figure although little is known about the priest Kings they were distinguished by the long beards and distinctive headgears below the NC were the priests further down the social order were a lead families who had accumulated wealth over time below them were farmers and various Artisans reflecting an increasing Division and specialization of Labor due to Urban Development at the lowest tier were slaves some captured in raids and others driven into slavery due to extreme poverty slowly the culture of Oro began to expand and various peoples across Mesopotamia the Zagros Mountains Anatolia and the Levant started to adopt oro's cultural and administrative elements it also seems that Oro managed to establish trading colonies throughout the region which significantly helped Advance trade and acquire more goods and raw materials to meet the growing demands of the city state during this time the samarians who were already import in Copper began importing tin from the Eastern neighbors they were the first to combine these two metals to create bronze crafting new agricultural tools and weapons thereby commencing what historians call the Bronze Age of History another development was a transformation from stamp seals to cylinder seals usually made of stone cylinder seals were impressed by Rolling them upon clay while they were used for the same purposes as stamps such as identification and storage ceiling they produced much more advanced artwork depicting scenes from everyday life of Sumerian deities arguably the most important and groundbreaking invention of that time was the writing system the invention of writing was driven by the need for efficient recordkeeping in Temple Distribution Systems around 3500 BC a Proto writing system known as Proto form script emerged this system featured simple signs some pictographic meaning the use of symbols to represent Concepts and others arbitrary however it was very primitive and had many limitations over the centuries it evolved into a more refined logo syllabic system that combined pictographs and syllables becoming the first proper writing system in the world known as Kun form writing although there were other protor writing scripts before k form was the first true writing system besides being extremely helpful for the Sumerians gfor writing provides us with invaluable insights into their history and [Music] culture over the course of a few centuries much changed in the political landscape of Suma many settlements around Uruk grew significantly in size and population transforming into cities with administrative centers impressive temples and walls during these years as wealth increased and cities competed for agricultural lands small military conflicts were becoming commonplace for this reason the old administrative system of Suma where the high priest king governed the city was abandoned in favor of the rise of true Kings during times of warfare and political instability a warrior leader was needed to guide the people initially pre would appoint a man to this role temporarily however over time the office of king became completely separate from the temple and the priests eventually becoming a hereditary position gradually nearly all the cities of Suma would have their own Kings thus in 2900 BC the early dynastic period of Mesopotamia began during this time there were several independent city states in Suma the greatest of which were orak Lagos Ur Nipper Kish adab and Uma each city state commanded the main worldall District its outskirts in the significant area of surrounding land every city had its distinct features for example W was a powerful state with a large sea port making it a very rich trade Hub in addition to its vast agricultural Fields neor was the religious Center of Suma ruled not by a king but by priests and it was dedicated to enil the supreme god of the Sumerians lagash was unique in that it comprised more than one city specifically the cities of lagash giru and Nina each City had its own tutelary Dey that protected it and the districts housing the main Temple of the deity were the most important places within the cities there was a factor that prompted cooperation among the city states and that was su's complete dependence on irrigation for its livelihood and growth the intricate nature of irrigation including continuous digging and Canal repair necessitated Cooperative efforts and systematic organization despite that there were frequent conflicts among the city states particularly during the middle and late dynastic period of Suma aside from conflicts over disp uted lands certain city States sought dominance over others expanding their control and subjugating neighboring cities during the early dynastic period we witnessed the great progress of the conform system which expanded and became widely used among the people of Suma and was even adopted by neighboring peoples it was during this era that the world's first schools were established where scribes were trained in writing to join the admin administrative system over time writing expanded Beyond Administration to include wall inscriptions and eventually evolved into the first literary works this development marked a significant achievement while also offering remarkable insights into the culture and events of that era by studying the texts from that time we can try to outline the social Hy of that period at the top was the king known as Lugal mean meaning big man as we mentioned kingship in Sumer emerged from the earlier role of the priest leader or NY as interstate conflicts intensified and the need for organized military leadership grew kingship became hereditary and while kings were not considered Dees themselves they ruled with Divine Authority representing the will of the gods they established regular armies equipped with Advanced military Technologies and tactics such as chariots and heavily armored infantry the title of NY evolved from its Origins as a type of King priest to that of a governor or subordinate ruler under the authority of the Lugal this transformation occurred particularly as city states expanded their influence and exerted dominance over neighboring settlements below the king and the governors were the Nobles comprised of members from ruling families and high ranking Palace administrators no often owned extensive Estates which they expanded by purchasing land from less fortunate citizens they also occasionally wielded some control over the vast lands that were owned by the temple the temple itself continued to play a central role as the largest and most important structure still serving both religious and administrative functions the temple owned significantly large areas of land this land was categorized into nna reserved for temple maintenance Kura allocated to Temple workers and Artisans and urul Le to individuals in exchange for a share of the crop commoners including Farmers Craftsmen merchants and doctors constituted the majority of the population despite the pervasive myth of absolute Theocratic control in Mesopotamian States and the administration's supposed dominance over all aspects of Life the real ity was very different the palace and the temple owned nearly half of the land while the remainder belonged to private owners so despite their social status many commoners owned private property and independently participated in the economic life of the city state the Communist were organized into large patriarchal families and clans passing down hereditary land rights that could be managed or transferred by Family Representatives clients and slaves occupied the lower end of the social Spectrum clients were dependent on the temple or the noble families receiving land or rations in return for their services slavery was an established institution in Suma as we mentioned earlier slaves were typically prisoners of war or individuals forced into servitude due to debt or punishment despite their status they had some legal rights and sometimes could eventually buy their freedom throughout this period there was a struggle for power between the temple and the palace which highlights the complexities of governance and social organization in the world's first cities however as noted earlier this era did indeed Mark the ascendency of the palace as the predominant institution as we know the Sumerians developed an extensive trading system and established relations with various different people peop Les these relations included not only trade but also cultural exchanges and occasional conflicts the texts from this period provide valuable insights into the identities of these peoples and how the samarians perceived them east of Suma was ilam whose inhabitants maintained close ties with the Sumerians there was significant cultural exchange but also many conflicts between them the Proto elamite script is evolved from su's Proto form Susa the greatest ilite city was heavily influenced by uro culture adopting its administrative systems and pottery Styles despite this influence ilam developed a unique culture of its own to the north lay aad where the people spoke the Semitic aradian language and ancestor of modern Semitic languages influenced by Samarian trade and colonization the acadians adopted the Kune form script and developed a literate culture although later many conflicts would arise between the acadians and Sumerians early interactions were mostly peaceful prompting many acadians to migrate Southward and form communities within several Sumerian cities along with the Sumerians the acadians developed some of the most sophisticated armies of the Bronze Age to other important neighbors of the Samaran Ian were the kingdoms of Mari and abla both inhabited by Semitic speaking peoples they were deeply influenced by sumarian culture and engaged extensively in trade with them despite occasional conflicts the two kingdoms also waged a series of Wars against each other known as the marry abla Wars in addition to their close neighbors we know that the samarians engaged in trade by sea and land with peoples from Egypt Maan and the indis valley civilization known to them as malua having explored the culture social organization and neighboring states of the Sumerians we can now examine the archaeological evidence to chronologically pinpoint some of the most significant events of the early dynastic period while many city states wielded significant power and wealth the majority of archaeological evidence including inscriptions documenting major events comes from two neighboring city states lagash and Uma one of the earliest recorded Kings whose name appears in over 50 inscriptions is W nanche The King Of lagash Who assumed the throne in 2494 BC as we mentioned the state of lagash controlled three cities lagash giru and Nina or nche is credited with many accomplishments including the construction of new temples the renovation of old ones and the excavation of canals following oran's Reign his son aural ascended to the throne of lagash in 2464 BC his rule was short-lived primarily due to a conflict with the neighboring city state of Uma there was a longstanding rivalry between the two city states primarily rooted in territorial disputes over the fertile region known as guedin it would Pro exist for more than a century significantly shaping the political and Military landscape of the region arugal was succeeded by his son yanam in 2454 BC Yan atum's military prowess made him one of the most formidable rulers of his time he launched successful campaigns against ilam to the east conquering most of the land and plundering the city of Souza and against Sumerian cities like Uma and Eric Ur akak and Kish his victories expanded the influence of lagash and he ruled over a vast region although he faced many uprisings during his Reign the conflict with Uma during Anan atum's Reign is well documented a detailed account commissioned by aam's nephew Ana and inscribed on the artifact known as the cone of Ana sheds light on how the Rivalry between lagash and Uma began according to the inscription the origins of the dispute date back to the reign of melim king of Kish who ruled around 2600 BC melim acting as a mediator arbitrated a border dispute over the region of guedin between lagash in Uma establishing a boundary marked by an inscribed s although presumably accepted by both parties this decision appears to have favored lagage and served the seeds of future conflicts us the king of Uma violated the agreement by removing the boundary Ste and seizing the guedin region with his army this territory remained under uma's control until Ian aam's Reign when he defeated uma's armies and established a new border treaty with anakal the then ruler of Uma Yan atum reinforced the boundary with ditches and SES but allowed the people of Uma to farm the disputed land in exchange for a portion of the crops ensuring a steady revenue for lash Ian aam's triumphs and achievements were recorded in the famous artifact known today as a Ste of the vultures his reain though ended in turmoil as his State faced attacks from ilam in the east and by aadan forces in the north aatam defended lagage valiantly but eventually fell in battle after which his brother in anatum succeeded him inanam faced new hostilities from Uma under the reign of UR Luma who disregarded previous agreements destroyed the boundary markers in the disputed region and invaded lagage with a great Army anam's son Anda who succeeded him in 2403 BC led lagash to victory over Ur Luma however he faced new challenges from ill Ur lum's son the conflict between anina and Ill concluded with a compromise that maintained the previous B country anina was succeeded by anatum II the last ruler of lash's first dynasty sometime during his rule the high priest of the temple a man named anari seized the throne and established his own hereditary rule over lagash during the Reigns of anari and his son lalanda lagash experienced extensive corruption and exploitation the palace bureaucracy imposed heavy taxes seize property from citizens officials unjustly confiscated animals and grain even Temple properties were appropriated for personal use stripping the temple administration of their wealth this exploitation extended across all levels of society with the rich and Powerful praying on the poor and vulnerable Artisans and apprentices were reduced to begging for food while orphans and widows were deprived of their few possessions many common were thrown into prison on the slightest pretext and huge taxes were imposed on nearly everything including marriages the mergim of rations the shearing of sheep and even burials however in 2351 BC a man known as urukagina Rose to power in lagash overthrowing the corrupt King lugara and implementing sweeping reforms to restore Justice he prohibited the Cesar of citizens property and abolished additional taxes and fees imposed by Palace officials Temple property that had been seized was returned to its rightful owners and charges for religious Services were significantly reduced urukagina ensured regular rations for Laborers Craftsmen and other workers he enacted laws to protect the vulnerable preventing the forced sale of houses and animals and freeing those imprisoned for dead or unpaid taxes he also also took a sacred vow to the god ningirsu the protected deity of lagash to safeguard orphans and widows from exploitation Uruk kagin's reforms represented a landmark in ethical governance constituting the earliest recorded instance of legislative measures though the law code itself has not survived despite all the kaga's efforts to fix rampant corruption and restore order to lagash the state had significant ly deteriorated by that time due to the former corruption this decline did not go unnoticed by neighboring states especially their longtime Rivals Uma during that time Uma was ruled by King Lugal zazi who was also the high priest of the Goddess nisaba known for his Ambitions in military conquest and warfare Lal agazi sought to capitalize on lash's weaken State as uma's greatest rival lagash became lagal gazi's first Target he launched attacks on all three cities lagash and giru were besieged three times for extended periods before he eventually managed to conquer them upon capturing agash and giru Lal zag gazi Unleashed a brutal retribution his soldiers sacked the cities and pillaged their temples with such intensity that shocked the entire region this ruthless act likely stemmed from the Deep rooted resentment between the two states but also served as a message to the rest of the surian Cities Lugal zazi proceeded to conquer Ur and ler while the rest of the Samarian cities surrendered to him without a fight and so Lugal zag gazi became the king of all of Suma and made Uruk the capital this consolidation however maintain a very fragile Unity among the Sumerian States Lugal zaz's Ambitions eventually drove him to expand his domain Beyond Suma he conquered most of akad and a portion of ilam while also extending his influence into regions of Syria he claimed to rule from the upper sea the Mediterranean to the lowest SE the Persian Gulf a rather bold claim that whether fully accurate or not highlighted his ambition however this newly formed Empire was not to last his reign was soon challenged by a formidable adversary sagun of aard sargon's Origins are shrouded in Legend he was said to have been born to an Acadian family and set a drift in a basket on the river he was rescued and raised by a humble Gardener and he eventually became the cup Bearer to ur zababa the king of Kish Sagen managed to overthrow or zababa and quickly established himself as a powerful leader demonstrating remarkable military and administrative skills sagon United all the acadians under his rule along with a Sumerian city of Kish his rapid Ascent to power posed a direct threat to Lugal a gazis rule setting the stage for a significant clash between their forces Lugal zag gazi mobilized a great Army and marched North to confront San however he was defeated in battle and executed shortly afterwards thus the rise of the acadians of assuma had begun after defeating theal zazi sagon focused on securing control over all of Suma he launched several military campaigns to subdue the Sumerian cities and dismantled their walls to prevent future rebellions this policy of enforced defenselessness was a departure from previous practices of warfare in Mesopotamia and underscored the severity and establishment of Acadian rule by 2334 BC Sagen had succeeded in subjugating all of sua he then turned his attention West and North expanding his domain by conquering regions such as Mari jarmi and ibla and extending his weeds to Anatolia the Levant and the Mediterranean he also campaigned East attacking ilam and marashi and looting their cities through this Conquest San managed to establish the first lasting Empire in world history he built or renovated the city of agade now known as akard and made it the capital of the Empire agade quickly became a prosperous City attracting gifts and tributes from all across the Empire this is because San established a tax system in which goods were sent to the capital and then redistributed all over the Empire enabling him to maintain tight control over the PO populus while simultaneously enriching and strengthening agade the city also thrived through trade along the Euphrates River and the Sea engaging with all the known trade routs of the Sumerians in addition to agade Sagen established several new Arcadian cities including the city of Babylon but it would be relatively insignificant for the first few centuries to control this vast territory Sagen appointed me members of his family and other fellow acadians to high administrative posts replacing many Sumerian Governors and Priests he also established numerous military garrisons in key regions the strategy allowed Sagen to maintain a tight grip on the Empire while gradually diminishing the power and influence of the suian Cities over her time neveress as the Sumerian proverb States what has submitted will exhibit resistance the Sumerians remain True to this sentiment despite being tightly controlled they frequently rebelled During the period of aadan rule in San's later years numerous Sumerian cities revolted he eventually managed to suppress them often with brutal measures San's Reign marked the transition from independent city states to a centralized Multicultural Empire a model that would influence many civilizations in the next Millennia sagon proudly assumed the titles king of Suma and aard as well as king of the world his rule also signaled the shift in the linguistic landscape of Mesopotamia with Acadian replacing Sumerian as the official administrative language while Sumerian continued to be used for thousands of years primarily in religious or literary texts Acadian and other Semitic languages gradually replaced it in everyday use over the centuries in fact many of the names used in this video which are the most common in historiography are actually Acadian versions of Sumerian names for example the city we know as Uruk was originally called unuk in Sumerian Uruk is its Acadian name similarly the city of UR was referred to as uim in Sumerian moreover the term Suma is Acadian translating to land of the civilized Kings the Sumerians themselves refer to their Homeland as kangar which simply means native land they also never called themselves Sumerians instead they identified as Saga meaning the blackheaded ones likely in reference to the hair colar with that being said the Acadian language and culture introduced to the Sumerians during sagon rule were already deeply influenced by the Sumerians up until that point Sumerian culture had been the dominant and most advanced in Mesopotamia long before the acadians conquered Suma many Acadian groups lived in Sumerian cities as we mentioned the acadians originally without a written script adopted the gam system from the Sumerians to write their own language and borrowed many Sumerian words in the process the religion of the acadians was also largely adopted from the Sumerians including their Pantheon mythology Temple architecture and worship practices the primary change was the renaming of deities from Sumerian to aradian nevertheless as the acadians developed over time the hierarchy and attributes of their gods underwent many changes after San's death in 2278 BC his son Rush ascended to the throne and immediately fac rebellions from cities of Suma ilam and even akad he ruthlessly suppressed these uprisings defeating the rebel armies plundering their cities demolishing their walls and enslaving a portion of the population eventually Rush was assassinated his brother Manish tushu succeeded him in 2269 BC and had to contend with several rebellions as well which he managed to subdue successfully he expanded the Empire's borders to the south and east however after A Reign of 14 years he too was assassinated he was succeeded by his son naram sin naram sin's Reign is often regarded as the Zenith of the Acadian Empire early in his Reign he faced a great Coalition of rebellious Kings from Suma and the surrounding regions likely the greatest uprising of the Acadian period he decisively defeated the rebel armies solidifying his power he then embarked on a series Ser of significant military campaigns to further expand the empire in the north he extended Acadian control into additional parts of the Levant the taus Mountains and Eastern Anatolia in the East he defeated the Ubi tribes of the zagas mountains and conquered more territories in ilam he then turned his attention South to Magan which had been a vessel state but had revolted against him naramsin personally captured mandano the king of Manan and established garrisons to secure the vital trade routs the wealth and prosperity of the aradian empire under naram sin were unparalleled fueled by a great agricultural Surplus and extensive trading system and the wealth looted from conquered cities this era of abundance LED naram sin to Proclaim himself king of the world a title his grandfather had used he also introduced a new title King of the four corners of the world which would be adopted by many rulers of the near East for Millennia to come furthermore naramsin made an unprecedented decision to deify himself as the God of agade this was a significant shift in Mesopotamian kingship while some Sumerian kings were deified after their deaths naramin proclaimed himself a god while still living and even build temples in his honor this established the trend of blending religious Authority with secular power in Mesopotamia however despite all this grandiosity and Glory naram's Empire would come crushing down one generation later in 227 BC his son sha kalisari assumed the throne his early years were marked by peace with no revolts or uprisings but this stability was shortlived during this time there was a prolonged period of hot and dry climate which devastated agricultural production severely weakening the Acadian State the Empire soon faced multiple attacks and uprisings in the East elamite forces revolted and then pushed Westward meanwhile the gutians a group of tribes from Zagros Mountains regarded by the Mesopotamians as barbarians invaded with a great Army conquering large parts of the empire amidst this invasions surian cities declared independence one by one sha kalisari domain was eventually reduced to the city of agade in its surroundings as he struggled to repel the invading armies sha kalisari was the final true emperor of akad his successors engaged in internal power struggles and were confined mainly to the city of agadi surrounded by a sea of Gans although they achieved brief expansions these territories were quickly lost again this turbulent period lasted from 2193 until 2154 BC when the guans finally sacked the city of agardi The Siege was so destructive that today there is still no archaeological evidence of the city's location after Conquering agardi the Gans swiftly subdued most of Suma plundering the cities and establishing their own rule the Gan Dynasty which endured for nearly a century they imposed taxes punished uprisings and rewarded loyalty however unlike the well organized aradian Empire Guan rule was predominantly military in nature establishing garrisons all around their territory their Administration lacked the centralized efficiency of the acadians and so the Samarian cities were finally able to recover their long lost wealth through trade at that time the most prosperous Sumerian state was lagash where a new Dynasty had been founded after the fall of agade and the establishment of Gan rule lagash was either semi-autonomous under the Gans or completely independent though it most likely was the former the founder of this new dynasty was uraba also known as urba who reigned from 2157 to 2144 BC in addition to controlling the state's three cities he also governed the city of UR the one who succeeded him was his son-in-law guda the most famous Sumerian king of the gotian period guda was a deeply religious man as well as an effective leader during his Reign lagash became incredibly prosperous he was responsible for the Reconstruction of the Great temple of the god Nam GSU in the city of giru known as the enu the materials used for the temple were obtained through trade from far away lands in addition to temple building gadea was engaged in Warfare with reports of campaigns against ilam specifically the cities of Susa and anshan following the reign of guda lagash experienced a tumultuous period when numerous Kings ascended to power guda was succeeded by his son or ningu who was followed by his own son ugma after ug's Reign urar another son-in-law of uraba ascended to the throne shortly thereafter nahmani also a son-in-law of uraba became king nahmani likely governed the cities of lagash as well as Ur and Uma he was the last ruler of the second lagash Dynasty founded by Ur Baba although he wied great power it is evident that during his Reign agash had come under the direct control of the Gans after centuries of aradian and Gan control the time had finally come for the Sumerians as a people to rise once again this Sumerian Resurgence was led by utu hengar the ruler of oruk rallying armies not only from Uruk but also from numerous other Sumerian cities he marched North to confront the Gans Udu henal campaign was a success he defeated the Gan armies and captured their King tyang although the Gans would continue to launch attacks in the years to come utu henal had managed to decisively defeat their main forces and reestablish Sumerian rule over various cities after a long period of subjugation however 7 years later he reportedly died while inspecting the construction of a dam either from natural causes or assassination utu henal became a legendary figure of among the Sumerians due to his achievements which were celebrated for centuries following his death his son-in-law and governor of UR or namu ascended to power and relocated the capital from UK to ur founding his own Dynasty the establishment of the so-called third dynasty of or in 2112 BC marked the beginning of the ne Sumerian period one of U's earliest actions was to wage war war against namani of lagash defeating him and dis establishing his dynasty by eliminating this key rival orur namamu established Ur and Uruk as the preeminent power centers in Suma this Victory paved the way for U's control over a v territory in Suma which included cities such as lagash Eric nepur adab and ler his Reign marked a period of stabilization and growth after so many years of foreign rule U's Administration was notable for its organizational efficiency and infrastructural development he embarked on extensive building projects including the construction of canals City walls and temples his most renowned architectural achievement was the zigurat of War dedicated to the Moon god Nana the structure measured 46 m in width and approximately 30 m in height it was excavated by archaeologists in the beginning of the 20th century and it was partially reconstructed in 1980 today it is one of Iraq's most prominent landmarks Oru is perhaps best known for his contributions to Legal reform through the famous code of uram the oldest surviving low code in history while Scholars suggest it was finalized by his son Shuli the code reflects ur's vision of justice and order it delineated clear rules for behavior and penalties for offenses here as some of the laws included if a man commits a murder he will be killed if a man knocks out tooth of another man he shall pay two shekel of silver if a man appeared as a witness and was shown to be a perjurer he must pay 15 shekels of silver hamu extended his his rule Beyond Suma through successful military campaigns in neighboring regions like ilam and aad despite his successes anamu was eventually killed in battle he is believed to have died while fighting the Gans who as we mentioned continued to invade the region despite earlier victories in 2095 BC Shuli suceeded his father Oram as the second king Shuli became a pivotal figure in ancient Mesopotamian history reigning for an impressive 48 years his rule witnessed substantial military administrative and cultural advancements that reshaped the so-called NEOS Sumerian Empire early in his Reign he forged a marriage alliance with the kingdom of Mari through his Union with taram uram daughter of Mar's King this Alliance not only strengthened political ties between the two states but also secured suian control over crucial trade routes along the Euphrates River Shuli was the first Sumerian ruler to establish a well organized conscripted Army under his rule the Empire's territory tripled in size he successfully campaigned against numerous cities and states to the North and the East encompassing regions from marasi and anshan to the Zagros Mountains along with parts of central Modern Day Iran shuli's expansion established a network of vessel States prompting him to arrange strategic marriages in order to ensure political stability one of his daughters was made queen of manashi and another daughter married the governor of ansha around the 20th year of his rule he deified himself inspired by the Acadian King naram sin who had similarly elevated his status while alive Shuli leveraged his Divine status to consolidate his author this act of self-deification gave rise to a religious and ideological framework centered on the cult of the king temples honoring the king God were erected across various cities towns and settlements each stared by its own priests administrators and laborers additionally Shuli instituted a calendar of holy days celebrations and daily rituals dedicated to honoring the Monarch and his Divine ancestors on more secular matters the political and administrative framework of the near Sumerian Empire was solidified during shuli's Reign through his extensive reforms let's examine this framework based on what we know from historical sources at the top of this hierar was the king who oversaw all aspects of governance along with the military below the King was the central Administration which played a crucial role in maintaining control over the vast territories of the Empire military Governors were pivotal in this system acting as direct representatives of the king they were responsible for enforcing Royal commands and overseeing provincial Governors the provincial Governors or NC managed individual provinces they oversaw local administrations and were responsible for the economic output of their region each province was expected to pay taxes and provide resources to the central government to the Bala system a tax redistribution mechanism introduced by Shuli this system ensured a steady flow of goods and resources to the central Administration supporting the state's needs and the Royal Court the administrative operatus also included a complex bureaucracy with a vast number of scribes trade in state schools the bureaucratic system was essential for the efficient management of resources economic planning and implementation of State policies the NEOS Sumerian reforms introduced new procedures for economic accounting a standardized system of measurements and a state calendar all aimed at unifying and coordinating the administration across the Empire the state's economy was divided into two main sectors the central or Royal sector and the local or Temple sector the central sector directly controlled by the king included Royal Estates and specialized production centers these were managed independently of provincial authorities and directly contributed to the state's wealth and resources the local sector comprised Temple households which while maintaining a degree of autonomy were ultimately under the supervision of the provincial Governors the temples were significant economic units responsible for a large portion of agricultural production however the king retained the right to extract Financial gains from these Temple Estates integrating them into the state's broader economic framework during shuli's Reign there were increased migrations and occasional raids of amorites in the region the amorites were a Semitic speaking nomadic people from Western Mesopotamia and the Levant who were viewed by the Sumerians as barbarians the presence of the nomadic amorites posed challenges to the established Sumerian city states as they periodically disrupted trade and stability this prompted Shuli to undertake a major project in his 37th year the construction of a Great Wall along the northern borders to deter Amorite incursions the increasing presence of the amorites combined with the legacy of Acadian rule of Suma and the significant Acadian population in cities throughout the NEOS Sumerian Empire indicates a growing change in the linguistic landscape of mesop Amia shuli's wife was a Semitic speaker and their two sons Amar sin and I sin both bore Semitic names despite this the Sumerian language remained predominant in administrative and religious contexts within the Empire Shuli also promoted Sumerian arts and literary Works extensively and personally pursued studies in mathematics while also demonstrating his proficiency as a skilled scribe after reigning for 48 years Shuli died possibly of natural causes or during a palace Uprising the exact circumstances remain unclear due to conflicting sources Amar sin the son of Shuli succeeded his father in 2047 BC he led several military campaigns into Orum and strategically important areas between Susana and the mountains of ilam in order to subdue various revolts the regular payment of tribute from all peripheral regions indicates that despite challenges amth sin effectively maintained stability and administrative efficiency throughout his realm in 2038 BC Amar sin was succeeded by his brother shusen during his Reign he faced increasing pressure from the Amorite tribes who were now entering the region in ever greater numbers than before in response to these incursions sh initiated the construction of another formidable wall while it initially managed to deter the amorites It ultimately proved ineffective in the long run shusen also launched military campaigns against huan cities along the upper tigers and suppressed rebellions in the northern zagr mountains overall both Amarin and shuin were competent leaders though they did not conquer any new lands like their father they effectively preserved the Empire's territory and administrative order despite growing external pressures however the stability would not last for long iin the son of shusen ascended to the throne of or in 2029 BC he began his reign with purges and property Caesar in major cities aimed at eliminating plots against him and reinforcing Central Authority iin faced significant threats particularly from the amoral es and elamites which forced him to heavily fortify the cities of or and nepur he quelled an uprising in northern Mesopotamia and later led the campaign against ilite forces the greatest threat to the Empire though was the ever increasing Amorite presence as we mentioned the amorites have posed a growing threat for several decades now as early as U's Reign the amorites initially arrived in small Clans or groups settling peacefully the periphery of the Empire or integrating into urban centers however certain Amorite tribes on the outskirts soon began raiding towns and cities for plunder or to establish small states at first Samarian authorities managed both the influx of migrants and these incursions by granting land benefits to some amorites employing them in various roles and even integrating them into the military and priesthood despite initial assimilations efforts the process took a significant turn with the amortization of the military by conscripting entire Amorite Clans into the army often under the own Chieftain the samarians aimed to employ their military Powers against other invading amorites this process however elevated many amorites to high administrative and Military positions bluring the lines between loyalty to the state and tribal kinship while it initially bolstered the Samarian defense defenses this policy strained internal cohesion some amorites decided to defend the Empire's periphery While others joined their fellow tribesmen for plunder and still others sought to establish their own small states meanwhile in the East the elamites declared independence and invaded Suma with a great Army amidst this chaos numerous provincial rebellions erupted disrupting Food Supplies and leading to famine in war and other major cities adding to the series of devastating setbacks at this critical time ishp era a local governor and commander of the city of Isen who originated from Mari was entrusted with securing grain supplies for the famine stricken or and other Sumerian cities however he harbored Royal Ambitions he told IIs sin that due to the Amorite invasions he could not transport the grain properly and that he needed more ships and time all while diverting resources to the city of Isen in 2017 BC he openly betrayed iin declaring himself king of Isen and seizing the holy city of neor this severely weakened or both in resources and Authority as other local Governors followed suit declaring independence and forming their own states by 2010 BC ishp era had Consolidated his power dominating Northern Suma with the support of nur's priesthood while subjugating local leaders who opposed him as loyalty to IIs sin wav it isp's expansion deprived all of vital Provisions hastening its collapse in 2004 BC the now independent elamites alongside Gan allies and other tribes from the zagas mountains delivered the final blow to or after years of Relentless Siege they ultimately breached the walls and heavily plundered the city IIs sin was taken captive to anshan marking the end of the third dynasty of or and the collapse of the once Mighty Neo Sumerian Empire the fall of The City Is tragically described in the famous literary text known as the lamentation over the destruction of War what remained were independent small states under Amorite Acadian and Sumerian rule the final Sumerian state was governed by ishp Era from its capital in enin where Sumerian remained the language of administration and religion however this state is often characterized as Sumerian Semitic or Sumerian aradian as the majority of its citizens spoke citic languages in their daily lives such as Acadian or Amorite furthermore the kings of Isen all spoke Acadian and bore Acadian names by the end of of his rule ISB era had successfully taken control of most Sumerian cities despite being surrounded by amorites elamites and a cadians he stabilized the region by consolidating his power and ensuring a steady supply of grain his successor Shu aishu who came to power in 1984 BC focused on maintaining diplomatic ties restoring temples and preserving Sumerian religious practices after 10 years of rule Eden Dagan succeeded him implementing religious reforms and advancing the Arts and literature he was suceeded by ished Dagan in 1953 BC who reinforced is's Authority and influence his Reign was marked by continued cultural growth and strategic efforts to dominate rival Amorite and ilite States lipid ishar who succeeded him in 1934 BC is renowned for his legal reforms known as the lipid Ishtar code of laws which greatly influenced later Mesopotamian legal Traditions including the famous code of hamurabi the dynasty would continue but a great power had began to emerge in the South since 2005 BC the city of Lassa had been controlled by an Amorite Dynasty and had been growing in strength during the reign of gunum who became king of Lassa in 1932 BC he began challenging ing is's Supremacy by conquering or and other cities over the next Century is's power and territory diminished while lassers increased during this time more amorites settled in the region either joining the Amorite ruled ler Kingdom for establishing their own small states meanwhile in the north another Amorite Dynasty ruled the kingdom centered around the increasingly powerful city of Babylon the final blow to the is Dynasty came during the reign of damik yishu when rimson the first of Lassa conquered Isen in 1794 BC marking the end of the Dynasty and the formal end of Sumerian rule over Mesopotamia by that time the amorites had fully assimilated into Mesopotamian culture since they spoke a Semitic language and lacked their own writing system they adopted Acadian a related Semitic language that had been used and written in this region for centuries their kingdoms became a blend of aradian Amorite and Sumerian cultures reflecting their successful integration in 1792 BC hamurabi became the sixth King of the Babylonian Dynasty and over the next few decades conquered all of Suma and much of northern Mesopotamia establishing Babylonia as a major power for the next 1,000 years two great Powers dominated Mesopotamia the Babylonians in the South and the Assyrians in the north both ruled by Amorite dynasties their dominion over the region would last until the rise of the Iranian Empires from the East a millennium later to say that Sumerian culture was the foundation of Mesopotamian and many Mediterranean as well as ancient Middle Eastern cultures would be an understatement although the Sumerians as a distinct people disappeared and their language fell out of Everyday Use the new kingdoms that arose and those that succeeded them were deeply influenced by Sumerian culture Sumerian continued to be used as a classical language in religious context and literature alongside old Babylonian and Assyrian Sumerian religion was preserved with its practices and deities adopted and reformed by the Babylonians and the Assyrians additionally the administrative systems of these later civilizations though they evolved over time were fundamentally rooted in Sumerian and Acadian principles the Babylonians and the Assyrians viewed themselves as the cultural inheritors of both the Sumerians and the [Music] acadians Sumerian is a language isolate meaning it has no known relatives or ancestral connections to other languages this isn't surprising given that it developed during a time when most people were hunter gatherers and languages had not yet become interconnected linguistic ties and influences emerged much later with the rise of Kingdoms and Empires large scale trade and great cultural exchanges however even in later times language isolates still existed like those of the Hans and the guans sumarian is fundamentally agutin native forming words and expressing grammatical relationships through a combination of affixes attached to a base root this results in Long complex word forms that convey detailed information the language's verb system is highly inflected indicating tense and mood and incorporating affixes to denote subject object and other grammatical roles nouns are marked for number and cased for suffixation and possession is indicated by attaching suffixes to the noun phonologically Sumerian included a great number of consonants and four vowels a e i and U this phonetic Simplicity contrast with the language's morphological complexity as we mentioned earlier in the video the Sumerians developed the first writing system the K form script its Origins traced back to the city of ok in the mid fourth millennium BC where growing administrative needs led to the development of a sophisticated means of recordkeeping the Sumerians utilized the Abundant clay from the Riverbanks to create tablets using a weed stick they would gently press markings into the damp clay the name Kun form comes from the Latin word Kus meaning wedge referring to the wedge shaped markings as we mentioned earlier initially Kun form was comprised only of pictographs these early symbols directly depicted objects like grain or meat aing in basic accounting tasks over time as the sociopolitical structures of Suma grew more complex the need for a more versatile writing system became apparent thus KFOR evolved from Mere pictographs into a more sophisticated script capable of representing not only concrete objects but also abstract Concepts sounds and ideas furthermore the early realistic type symbols evolved into much more abstract signs with a passing the centuries many signs acquired additional meanings and phonetic values allowing for the representation of a wide range of linguistic elements Beyond just nouns the key change was the gradual shift towards logo syllabic script introducing hundreds of new symbols to represent syllables this transformed K form into a blend of pictographs and syllabic characters making it easier to learn and use another characteristic of the developed conform writing system is that it also had elements of Rebus writing where symbols represented both objects and phonetic sounds for example water was called a and the symbol for water was used to represent the phonetic syllable a therefore the symbol was used in writing words containing the r sound even if they were unrelated to water in meaning while initially Kor included over 2,000 distinct signs it later streamlined to about 600 hundreds of thousands of Sumerian K form tablets have been found around 95% of them have to do with economic transactions storage and administration this is not surprising as KFOR was originally invented for such purposes the tablets facilitated the recording of trade Taxation and Resource Management scribes meticulously recorded details about exchanged Goods quantities and the parties involved ensuring accuracy and accountability these records have greatly contributed to our understanding of the Sumerian economy extensive trade systems tools used in building and agriculture population estimates and the Sumerian mathematical system while the economic tablets offer valuable insights into Sumerian life they provide limited information about the broader culture fortunately as time time pass the Sumerians began writing about a wide range of topics Beyond administrative and economic matters expanding their use of G form to include literature the discovered literary Works include narrative poems that recount the myths and Adventures of gods and heroes hymns dedicated to deities and rulers Lamentations expressing sorrow over the destruction of a City Royal inscriptions and wisdom literature featuring Proverbs and Fables in the next chapter we'll explore the first two topics in detail the poems about the destruction of surian cities are tragic narrations deeply intertwined with religious themes a great example is the lamentation over the destruction of UR which describes the catastrophic fall of the city in 2004 BC for context Nana the moon God is the patron deity of UR here is an except from the PO oh City your name exists but you have been destroyed oh City your wall Rises high but your land has perished oh my city like an innocent you your lamb has been torn from you oh urm like an innocent goat your kid has perished oh City your rights have been alienated from you your powers have changed into alien powers how long will your bitter lament Reeve your lord Who Weeps how long will your bitter lament grieve Nana Who Weeps regarding Royal inscriptions they typically serve to commemorate the construction of temples or great offerings to the gods they also occasionally declared a king's Ascension or simply recorded the ruler's name one example is this for NADA king of urm son of mesan King of urm built the temple for huk as for wisdom literature Samarian Proverbs constitute a significant portion of it the Proverbs originated from the early dynastic period however most surviving collections are from later eras when suian functioned primarily as an academic and lurgical language rather than being spoken in everyday life some of the most famous Proverbs include what has submitted will exhibit resistance but possessions are flying birds they never find a place to settle one should not scorn bread which has turned bad who can compete with righteousness it creates life marrying is human having children is divine when present it was considered a loin cloth when lost it is considered fine clothing a man raising his hand in Anger does not see clearly a loving heart maintains a family a hateful heart destroys a family talking endlessly is what humankind has most on its mind he who has nothing cannot let go of anything the Sumerians also developed fables that offered moral advice or lessons about animal behavior often with a touch of humor typically these fables featured conversations between two different types of animals such as in the the debate between the birds and the fish some fables even included plants in the dialogues like the debate between sheep and grain where they argued over their importance to humankind or between Seasons as in the debate between winter and summer a fundamental aspect of Kor writing was the role of the scribes the samarians developed the world's first schools specifically to teach scribes how to read and write not everyone could become a scribe these schools relied on tuition fees for funding as education was neither Universal nor compulsory as a result most students came from wealthy families although there were exceptions to this rule the origins of Sumerian scribe schools Trace back to as early as 3,000 BC by 2500 formal writing education was established across Suma the school was known as edua which means tablet house the head and main teacher of the school was known as the school father the assistant professor as the big brother and the students were called School Sons both teachers and students were almost exclusively male with only a few recorded exceptions of female students initially aimed at training scribes to meet the economic and administrative needs of temples and palaces Samaran schools evolved into centers of culture and knowledge students learned to write K form through memorization and reproduction of related words and phrases including long lists of names and complex grammatical structures they also engaged in literary and Creative Studies copying and imitating a vast array of poetic works from myths and epic Tales to hymns Lamentations and wisdom literature in addition to language and literature students expanded their knowledge in mathematics geography zoology and botony the schools encouraged creative writing and students eventually produced literary works of their own most graduates became scribes in the service of the temple or Palace though some went on to become teachers after the Acadian Conquest Sumerian scribes developed the earliest known dictionaries translating Sumerian words and phrases into aradian the teaching of Sumerian and the K form script led the first tadian scribes to rever Sumerian language and literature as a result even though the administrative language was a Cadian schools during this era played a crucial role in preserving Sumerian culture and knowledge aside from the acadians Canon writing was eventually adopted by various other peoples over the ages including the elamites Hans marians aans oratian Babylonians Assyrians Iranians and [Music] Hittites religion played a fundamental role in Mesopotamia the Sumerians had a wellestablished set of beliefs with a Pantheon of powerful Gods a rich mythology a prominent class of priests and a great variety of religious rights to understand their religion we first need to explore the Sumerian Pantheon unlike many Egyptian gods the Sumerian gods were anthropomorphic meaning they had human features despite being Immortal they exhibited human traits they ate and drank married and had children could be injured and sometimes even killed like humans they were caring compassionate and curious but also greedy deceptive and aggressive at times in order to truly comprehend Sumerian mythology we need to explore how the Sumerians perceived the creation of the world the origins of their gods and the roles these Gods played it's important to remember that Sumerian mythology was not fixed there were many different versions of the same events and the attributes of gods often changed over time with many of them sharing similar traits additionally variations existed between city states and throughout different periods as Sumerian religion was practiced for thousands of years despite this certain aspects were generally accepted the most widely known version of The Creation myth is the following in the beginning there was the vast primeval Sea from this sea emerged the cosmic Mountain which comprised Heaven and Earth United as one Heaven and Earth were personified as two primordial deities an the god of heaven and key the goddess of the earth key was both sister and concert of an through their Union they produced many children including enlil the god of air and wind and Anki the god of water and knowledge enil was the one who separated Heaven and Earth thereby creating the world enlil and Ani along with the other children of an and Kei had children of their own leading to the creation of new deities the chief deities of the Sumerians were collectively known as the anunaki meaning the descendants of an among the approximately 1,000 Sumerian deities 50 were considered the main Gods were the most important of these being the great seven an enlil and enki whom we have already mentioned along with utu Nana inana and nenor now let's take a look at the great seven individually an the god of heaven was initially revered as the Supreme deity however during the early dynastic period his importance waned as enel Rose to prominence becoming known as the king of the Gods and King Of Heaven and Earth andil was believed to bestow kingship upon Sumerian rulers and guide them through their Reigns the Sumerians held enil in profound reverence portraying him as a benevolent and fatherly figure who safeguarded the welfare of all people he was credited with creating the world and inventing crucial agricultural tools however enil was also the deity responsible for punishing Humanity when deemed necessary by the gods Ani brother of Anil and God of water and wisdom held significant importance in Sumerian mythology he presided over freshwater sources rivers and lakes which were vital to Sumerian culture and livelihood Ani was also revered as the patron God of civilization and the Arts while it was enil that brought forth the world Ani organized and perfected it he also Express the highest level of care for humans compared to all other gods as for key the goddess of the earth and mother of enil and Ani she is not included in the great seven she is mentioned only in mythological texts and there were no dedicated temples to her this is because enil though primarily the god of air took on her role as well when he separated Heaven and Earth becoming associated with the Earth alongside his other attributes it is likely that key evolved into Niners who is included in the great seven Niners like key was the goddess of fertility and the mother of all living things possessing earth related attributes further supporting this theory is the fact that nin horag is an epithet meaning Lady of the mountain moreover ninh horag had no recorded parents therefore she must have sprang from the Primeval sea just like key according to most myths Ani and eners worked together to create the human race after the world was established from enil's Union with the goddess ninlil came two Offspring the first was Nana also known as suen or sin the god of the Moon who was believed to travel the sky in a river boat one of Nana's symbols was a reclining Crescent which resembled the new moon as seen from the Mesopotamian PL s this Cresent similarity to bull horns likely led to the bull becoming his Associated animal the second Offspring was inana the Goddess of Love and War occasionally linked to fertility and political power inana plays a major part in many surviving Sumerian myths sometimes as a central figure sometimes in a supporting role and occasionally as an antagonist she is fierce adventurous and quick to anger from the union of Nana and his wife ningle arose utu the god of the sun and divine Justice who was said to ride a chariot drawn by mythical beasts his role was to ensure fness and righteousness both in the Divine and the human world among the 50 most important gods and goddesses alongside the principal ones were Dees such as areso the goddess of the Underworld nisaba the goddess of writing and Grain and in Casi the goddess of beer another notable deity was niru the son of enil and n horag it was a warrior God also associated with Agriculture and irrigation and was revered as a heroic figure the Sumerians developed an extensive literature that included various myths about the gods one of the most famous is the Deluge or flood myth the earliest of its kind in the world the Sumerian version is fairly different from the later Babylonian and biblical stories and because the tablet containing the myth is partially broken we did not know its full extent according to the story at some point the gods decided to send the flood to punish and Destroy mankind but the reason is unclear due to missing fragments a king named Zeos sudra is warned by a Divine voice about the impending catastrophe in response he built an ark in order to save himself his family his followers and pairs of various animal species Zeus sudra was the one worn by the gods because he had piously performed Libations and daily RS to them the flood comes lasting seven days and nights in destroying most of humanity but the people in the ark survived finally the sun god utu Rises and the flood Retreats the gods an and enil bestow eternal life on zus sudra for preserving Mankind and Wildlife zus sudra then settles in the land of Dil Moon and his descendants begin to repopulate the region leading to the eventual thriving of humankind once again there are hundreds of other myths about the gods as we mentioned the goddess inana is featured in many of them one example is the story where inana tricks the god Ani into giving her the gifts of civilization which she then brings from Ani's home in IDU to her own city in oruk in another myth she defeats the mountain God EBY after he disrespect her additionally there is a myth where she descends to the underworld passing through its seven Gates and losing all her power she is killed by her sister aresol but she is later resurrected and returns to the surface stronger with the help of her attendant goddess nin Shor the gods were believed to have two different types of presence a Divine one where they all lived on the mountain of Heaven and Earth the place where the sun rose and an Earthly one as previously mentioned each city state had its own Patron deity according to Sumerian belief these de's Earthly manifestation dwelt within the Great temple of their respective City in Ur for example where Nana the god of the moon was the patron deity he was believed to physically reside within the primary Temple of the Towering zigurat more specifically the great statue of Nana that stood on the altar was considered his Earthly manifestation the people venerated the statue as if it were the deity itself offering it food drinks and dressing it in Rich clothing this was the case in all other Sumerian cities the greatest tragedy that could befall a Sumerian city was the destruction of its main Temple and the Looting of its statue such an event signified that their God had abandoned them leaving the city without hope although those responsible for it would inevitably face divine retribution to reinstate their City the first step was to rebuild the Temple and restore the statue thereby acquiring Divine protection once more while each city state had its own Patron deity the city of neor was the religious Center for all Sumerians as previously stated it was unique in being ruled not by a king but by a group of priests niod's Patron deity was enil the king of the Gods from Craftsmen to Farmers and from Kings to commoners thousands would undertake pilgrimages every year to offer gifts at enil's most revered Temple known as Anor which translates to House of the mountain in addition to the gilary deities of each City every person had their own personal deity this deity might be linked to their family profession or simply chosen based on personal preference this god or goddess was the one they prayed to the most and made the most offerings to as Sumerians believed they needed a Divine Advocate to appeal to all the gods on their behalf despite their immortality the gods were deeply engaged in the Affairs of the human world according to Sumerian belief humans were created from clay solely to serve the gods by providing them with food drink and shelter this allowed the gods to focus on their Divine activities without mundane distractions like farming and Gathering water the people's perspective on their God's morality was dualistic while the gods were revered as patrons of ethical Behavior they were also seen as introducing enmity violence and falsehood into the world despite this the samarians believe that their gods generally preferred truth and Justice over oppression and Corruption the reasons behind the God's actions though would often remain obscure leaving humans bewildered the vulnerability highlighted the precariousness of human existence as people lived under the constant threat of unknown Fades decreed by unpredictable deities as for the afterlife the Sumerians envisioned to Bleak and shadowy existence the Netherworld was governed by deities like arish kigle and nurgle along with various other gods and demigods acting as judges life after death was seen as a dismal reflection of Earthly existence mostly devoid of joy and light regardless of rituals and prayers aimed at ensuring the well-being of the deceased the overall Outlook was mostly pessimistic with little expectation of a blissful afterlife the deceased were thought to continue needing material Provisions similar to those of the living and the social hierarchies of the Living World were mirrored in the Underworld despite their grien view of the afterlife the Sumerians plac great emphasis on ritual and piety during life continuous devotion and lamentation were considered appropriate responses to suffering and Misfortune in the hope that the gods might eventually hear and respond favorably this religious framework highlighted the importance of maintaining the God's favor through strict adherence to Ritual practices and ethical Behavior ultimately the Sumerian worldview was one of dutiful service to capricious Gods where human existence was fraught with uncertainty on a more bright note the samarians believe that the gods brought order out of chaos thereby fostering civilization this belief motivated them to become increasingly Innovative resourceful to seek knowledge and to strive for continuous advancements in order for civilization to triumph over disorder the by for order and progress was deeply rooted in their reverence for their gods the Sumerians worshiped their gods in various ways with temples serving as the primary centers of religious activity daily rituals in temples included offerings of food Libations of water and beer and the burning of incense the construction and renovation of temples were marked by elaborate ceremonies and rituals reflecting the high esteem in which these structures were held as we mentioned Sumerian temples functioned not only as religious centers but also as hubs of Economic and administrative activity Temple Personnel included a variety of priests and officials the administrative head known as s oversaw the Temple's buildings and finances while the spiritual leader the N was in charge of the rituals depending on the deity served the role of n could be filled by either a man or a woman typically if the temple was dedicated to a female deity the N would be male alternatively if it was dedicated to a male Dey the N would be female often the daughter of the king below the N were various Priestly classes each with specific though often unknown to us responsibilities many priests also served as Temple singers musicians and Poets as music especially hymns played a significant role in suian worship practices special feasts and holidays featured spectacular ceremonies with numerous festivals celebrated throughout the year often tied to agricultural Cycles or significant mythological events regular monthly feasts coincided with lunar phases and the newear holiday held particular significance the Sumerians used the Luna calendar and were the first ones to divide the year into 12 months in addition to Temple ceremonies and official celebrations indiv individuals were expected to pray to the gods and offer Libations in their own homes as part of personal religious practice another important aspect of Samaran religion was the connection between a king and the gods kings were believed to have a divine right to rule granted by the gods and were often seen as intermediaries between the human and the Divine realm though not as Gods themselves except in rare cases Kings frequently proclaimed that it was enil who bestowed kingship upon them and they held enil along with their City's Patron deity in the highest regard above all other gods as previously mentioned the King was expected to perform various rituals and offerings including Libations prayers and a pilgrimage to the Temple of enil in nepur additionally he was responsible for building new temples or reconstructing old ones during the New Year festivities a king would perform the sacred wedding ritual a symbolic marriage between the king and the Priestess representing the goddess inana this ritual was believed to ensure the fertility and prosperity of the land kings were also thought to be nurtured by the milk of the mother goddess nuruk Sumerian kings were sometimes deified or became Legendary Heroes centuries after their deaths one of the most famous Kun form findings is the collection of tablets known as the Sumerian kingl list which records numerous Sumerian cities their rulers and the lengths of their Reigns the text Blends mythology Legend and history it begins with purely mythical long reigning Kings mentions the great flood and then progresses to more realistic Reigns the further back in history the more legendary and divine the kings were their names are often written with a determinative sign for deities and temples were built in their honor the scpt starts by stating that kinship descended from the Heavens to the city of aru where alulim became king and ruled for 28,800 years it continues listing subsequent Kings who ruled for even longer periods such as 36,000 or 43,200 years the kingship then moved from IDU to bad tiira to lar and other cities following the great flood the rain lengths decreased but still remain unrealistic ranging from 300 to 1,200 years with kingship moving from City to City every two or three Reigns gradually the numbers become more sensible with Reigns of 40 to 60 years and the kingship transferring to more familiar and archaeologically verified cities the list then continues mentioning historically verified and

were adopted by the acadians Assyrians and Babylonians some deities retained their names and attributes While others were given new ones inana became ishar eni became AA U became shamash and Nana became sin later cultures also created their own Gods such as Marduk for the Babylonians and Asher for the Assyrians from Temple architecture to religious hymns music and festivals many Sumerian practices were preserved by these later peoples famous myths like the great flood and the tales of Gilgamesh greatly influen the civilizations of the near East and the Mediterranean from North Africa to GRE Anatolia the Levant Mesopotamia and Iran many ancient cultures borrowed elements of Sumerian religion [Music] over the past two centuries archaeologists excavations have uncovered thousands of Sumerian artworks revealing a remarkable level of intricacy in this section we will focus on the most notable art styles of each period since the Sumerian civilization spanned thousands of years their art transformed significantly over time starting with the oruk period a wide array of art forms emerged among these were the cylinder seals intricately engraved to create Impressions on Clay these cylinders were made from materials like Stone Carnelian lapis lazle bone and ivory they depicted scenes ranging from Agriculture and religious practices to festivals as well as mythological beings and gods these artifacts offer insights into various aspects of Sumerian civilization during that era and continue to do so for later periods as well additionally there are many artworks that depict the priest Kings of that era distinguished by their long beards and hats these priest kings are represented in statues crafted from Limestone and alabaster but they also appear on cylinder seals knife handles and vases they are often portrayed with their hands clasped or engaged in activities such as feeding animals and wrestling with beasts animal life was a common theme in Sumerian artart featuring depictions of bulls sheep goats and various mythological creatures these animals were depicted on figurines crafted from Limestone as well as cylinder seals and other carved objects one of the most renowned artifacts from that period is the oruk Limestone trough discovered in the temple of inana in oruk dating back to around 3,300 to 3,000 BC it likely served a religious rather than practical purpose the carvings on it portray a possession of sheep with a weed Hut at the center during the Oro period religious artifacts held a prominent place in Sumerian art two in particular are the most famous the first is the Wares a vessel made from Alabaster discovered in the temple of inana in UK it features three tires at the bottom scenes of grains vegetation and A procession of ox and sheep in the middle men carrying offerings of foods and at the top a complex scene depicting men and women likely priests against the backdrop of a temple here a group of priests along with a wall are portrayed alongside animal statues on the walls they offer fruits and grain to the goddess inana adorned with an elaborate headgear standing before her Shrine distinguished by two Reed door poles with banners or bundled reads the second artifact is the famous mask of warka the first almost complete life-size depiction of a human face made from White marble its eyes and eyebrows were inlaid with shelves for the wides and Lapis lazle for the pupils and its ears had holes for earrings The Mask likely represents the face of the goddess inana and was originally part of a fulls size wooden statue the head would have been adorned with facial paint and a large wh big as for the temple architecture and art interior walls and columns were adorned with cone mosaics a unique decorative method invented in oruk as we mentioned earlier in the video Artisans embedded thousands of baked clay cones into wet plaster and then placed them on the walls and columns with the tips forming multicolor designs for the exteriors of zigurat they used patterns made of plain and colored bricks in order to create interesting visual effects next is the early dynastic period a time when art truly flourished in suumer evidenced by the discovery of thousands of artifacts during this period sculpture became more complex and abundant featuring both statues and figurines the Sumerians also Advanced Metal working creating sophisticated artworks from gold silver copper and electrum often inlaid with materials such as shell and lavis lazery they produced a variety of items from metal including figurines and jewelry the jewelry was particularly notable for incorporating precious and semi-precious stones like Jade lapis lazle and Carnelian by far the largest and most famous collection of artifacts is known as the treasury of ore in the 1920s archaeologist learnard woy and his team excavated a vast Cemetery in the ancient city of or located outside the city's walls they discovered approximately 1,840 Graves 16 of which were richly adorned these Royal tombs were arranged in a complex at the cemetery's Deep Center and most of them date to approximately 2600 to 2450 BC the individuals buried in the central complex were kings queens and high priests or priestesses surrounding these elite figures were the remains of numerous attendants including soldiers bodyguards musicians handmaidens and household staff who were sacrificed to accompany the Elites in death either willingly or forcefully the tombs also indicated the practice of animal sacrifices particularly of oxen the largest of these Graves is known as the great Death Pit which contains 74 attendants six men and 68 women it is likely that no king or queen was buried here as there was no sign of a constructed chamber the six men were dressed as soldiers and presumably guarded the tomb while the women were dressed in Scarlet garments adorned with ornamental headdresses and an abundance of jewelry including necklaces earrings and bracelets crafted from gold lapis lazle silver and Carnelian the most famous findings from the great death Death Pit include the per artifacts known as Rams in a Thicket which depict a goat standing on its hind legs to eat the leaves of a tree these figures approximately 45 cm or 18 in in height were crafted from copper lapis lazle and gold leaf their bases

believed to be a standard carried during Royal processions hence its name however it might have been used to store valuable objects serve as a treasury for the king or even function as a case for a musical instrument examining the Royal treasury of UR gives us a clear picture of the elaborate art of the early dynastic period however there were additional types of art discovered from this era sculpture was particularly prominent in Suma during this period thousands thousand of statues and figurines depicting both males and females most often priests or pilgrims offering gifts to the gods were found throughout Suma occasionally farmers were depicted as well the majority of these figures were made with their hands clasped together a characteristic of earlier Sumerian statues they are usually depicted wearing a kaak the traditional Sumerian clothing for both men and women which was a skirt made of sheep or goats skin with the fleece interestingly this period saw the emergence of statues depicting Kings which had similar looks and clothing to the other figures that were larger in size and were inscribed with a king's name most statues were made from Stone clay or marble but there were some that were crafted from metal in addition to human figures many statues of domesticated animals like bulls and goats were found Stone carvings on large Sly and base reliefs constituted another popular art form many of these decorated temples and served as vodi reliefs often depicting scenes of Temple offerings gods or their symbols others depicted scenes from everyday life such as Banquets agriculture or river sailing Limestone and alabaster relieves were commissioned by Kings to depict their achievements including victories in the field of battle these reliefs combined art with K form scripts highlighting the King's accomplishments there were also reliefs that showed the king offering food and Libations to a deity or depicted scenes from his console Temple art and architecture continued to thrive following established patterns zigurat structures collored clay brick walls and Cone mosaics were all very common additionally hundreds of thousands of metalwork artifacts on this p period were discovered including necklaces rings and earrings primarily made from gold cornelian and Lapis lazle among other materials these pieces sometimes featured geometric motifs as well as farm animals and mythological creatures after the early dynastic period came the Acadian period during which Acadian art became more prevalent than Sumerian art this era saw a shift towards more sec themes focusing on Acadian Kings and conquerors as well as their subjugated people however Sumerian art Traditions remained influential in the later lagage period there was a notable increase in sculpture particularly in statues that depicted rulers such as guda and his father these statues were made from diorite a material obtained from the land of Magan During the lagage period there was a surge of religious art including statues carvings and stilly made from various different types of stone and [Music] metals the Neo Sumerian period experienced a Renaissance in art with sculpture and jewelry flourishing the most this era prominently featured more depictions of Kings portrayed in statues base reliefs and cylinder [Music] seals music played a fundamental role in Marian culture serving as a great part of religious ceremonies Royal Banquets and general entertainment per caution instruments were integral to religious hymns and processions the Sumerians played both large and small drums made from wood or metal and covered with Bal skins these were typically played by hand and occasionally with sticks rattles and  were also commonly used with jingling pieces of metal along with timal and tambourines [Music] wind instruments were essential in Sumerian music as well although not as prominent as percussion instruments they generally fell under two categories vertically played flues and read pipes which could also include double pipes these instruments mostly accompanied the drums but they were occasionally played solo as well the most complex instruments were the harps and Liars these were played at both religious ceremonies and and banquets and were revered as gifts from the gods made from wood metal or a combination of both they had gut strings and were played either by hand plucking or with a plum some were very large in size producing deep resonant bass sounds similar to those of a cello or a contrabas lot instruments emerged later around the 19th century BC unlike other instruments ludes were used mostly for secular occasions and became more prominent in Mesopotamia in later centuries regarding their music theory the Sumerians developed a musical system during the late Neo summerian period that continued with the Babylonians Assyrians hians and other NE Eastern cultures they standardized the tuning of a heptatonic and dionic system for their liar establishing seven interrelated scales this means that Sumerian and later Mesopotamian music sounded more similar to Modern Western European folk music than to Modern near Eastern [Music] music the legacy of the Sumerians endured long after their decline their culture influenced civilizations such as the Babylonians Assyrians Iranians Greeks various Anatolian peoples and many more thus leaving a profound impact on a significant part of the world as a tribute we will showcase some of the greatest achievements attributed to the Sumerians inventions and advancements that shaped human history in numerous ways these are the invention of the wheel the first sailboat the first writing system the earliest law code the first 12month calendar The Potter's Wheel the oxra plow Basin and shadu irrigation techniques the establishment of the first cities the development of the first mathematical system the the establishment of the first schools the creation of the first libraries and much much more the Sumerians were truly a remarkable people [Music]
