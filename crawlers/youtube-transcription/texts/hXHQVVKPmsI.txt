in Japan I had no idea that they had made the sarcophagus covers in Japan that were exactly the shame as the same as the ones they made in Egypt and in a place there is supposed to be zero connection between ancient Japan and ancient Egypt in 2016 the famous Chinese geochemist Sun weong quoted Sima Chan's description of the Topography of the Shia Empire traditionally regarded as China's founding Dynasty dating from 2 70 to 1600 BC northwards the stream is divided and becomes the nine Rivers reunited it forms the opposing River and flows into the sea wrote simaan in his first century historiography in other words the stream in question wasn't China's famed Yellow River which flows from west to east there is only one major river in the world which flows northwards which one is it the professor asked the Nile someone replied [Music] it is only through a diligent study of the past that one can perceive the Mosaic of the self much has been made about the arrival of the Vikings in America before Columbus and yet comparatively there are orders of magnitude more pieces of evidence that show that Africans in multiple waves brought civilization to Asia especially well into the Far East beyond the classical civilizations in the Mediterranean and meso amicas there is plentiful but little known and undeniable evidence of an African seating of civilization in Asia and an even more surprising evidence of African presence all the way at the other side of the globe in Japan and this evidence dates back to fonic times when taken into account it shows that Africans had a civil civilization that not only circumvented the globe but also left its Mark in the form of culture writing religion architecture mathematics science and genetics all of which we will cover today from the hieroglyphs in ancient China to the nubio comedic Egyptian likee sarcophagus in Japan and the numerous depictions of black Africans in the Far East let's explore how the often forgotten influence of the Africans helped shape Chinese civilization note again that in our quest to cover African historical truths we distinguish between civilizations that were African and civilizations that were seeded by Africans in other words when we say a civilization has been seeded by black Africans we are showing that the science culture religion technology influential members of the early civilization and often early rulers comes from black Africa what we are not saying is that the the indigenous people who benefited were not capable of civilization building and in fact in many cases they went on to build civilizations that are grandiose well after the African colonists weren't there anymore and in our Pursuit for truth we must follow where the evidence takes us this is the without History Channel every episode we bring Salient facts about African ancient civilizations in history and detail how these ancient civilizations set the foundation of our modern world we dive deep into what research reveals about the often overlooked and misattributed contributions about these key eras in our Collective history this channel would not exist without the invaluable support of our benefactors as the Ashanti proverb goes no contribution is too small you can find various ways to support Us in the video description you will also find a multitude of sources for those that like to dive deeper into these [Music] subjects remember Professor Sun weong that I mentioned in the beginning of the video who showed that the Shia Dynasty rulers stated their Origins as ancient Egypt well Sun Also showed that China's Bronze Age Technology widely thought by Scholars to have first entered the northwest of the country through the prehistoric Silk Road actually came from ancient Egypt in the past year Sun asserted that the founders of Chinese civilization were not in any sense Chinese but actually migrants from Egypt he conceived of this connection in the 1990s while performing radiometric dating of ancient Chinese bronzes to his surprise their chemical composition more closely resembled those of ancient Egyptian bronzes than native native Chinese ores isn't that telling that the radiometric signature of the bronze that happens to have significantly contributed to China's earliest founding Dynasty that signature is not Chinese nor of the surrounding region it is not European and it is not random but it is from Africa this shows that the technology Revolution that sparked the Chinese story came from Africa and we will later on see that it is not just Metallurgy that the Africans brought with them but also writing religion and culture there is another civilization that bears signs of African seeding and it is the most eastern [Music] civilization the Land of the Rising Sun The Early African influence here shows how far the reach of the ancient African civilization was in the book encounter with logos author author Eric stall demonstrates how ancient Japanese and ancient Egyptian share a multitude of words that not only share pronunciation but also meaning a striking example of this is the word for house which is CA in the African comedic language and Minka in Japanese meaning private house in his book stall comes to the conclusion that the intersection between the two languages are too numerous to attribute to chance and that one language was clearly seated by the other and since ancient Egyptian is the older of the two it stands to reason that Egyptians birthed the foundational element of Japanese culture another interesting marker of cultural influence is the presence of identical sarcophagus covers in Japan and Kemet one of the mysteries of Japanese ancient history is the short megalithic period that yielded surprising Monumental Stone carvings with some weing over 15 Tons the most surprising of these Stoneworks is this sarcophagus covering it is identical to that found in early dynastic era of ancient Egypt the dimensions of the side indentations and the Angles and proportions all match what are the chances of finding an exact sarcophagus covering in Egypt and Japan what are then the chances that these coverings are not just similar but identical to the point of being interchangeable and when you add to this the fact that Japanese language is shown to be genetically related to ancient nubio ktic language then the chances of these being by chance are astronomically low the whole Japanese culture so revered today Bears all the Hallmarks of an almost identical civilization in Africa one that was said to have descended from the nubio ktic civilization itself that third wave of African colonization would have happened after the fall of Kemet in a recent genetic study Dr diako showed that the Ado people in Nigeria share the same Hao group as the Japanese people and in fact no other Asian group has this specific marker that is predominantly found in the Ado people this finding is in line with the multitude of similarities that are found between the Japanese people and the Ado people from language again with intersections too numerous to be attributable to chance to Art to religion and many other aspects of both cultures at the end of the video we share interesting excerpt from the YouTube channel African History station yet another Gem of African history and Renaissance the implications of this cannot be understated it would mean that the Ado people of Nigeria not only Built the greatest archaeological structure in history of humanity the Great Wall of Benin to protect their City whom European explorers have described as well ahead of European capitals at the time but further to this the undeniable EV evidence of the colonization of Japan by the Edo people shows that they knew how to navigate the Seas with exactitude the mainstream historical narrative has it that China started to colonize Japan around the 1 Century ad but the Chinese themselves left us some interesting Clues on who started their main dynasties and it was revealed by one of China's most renowned historians we have seen previously how those who sparked the Bronze Age in China the dynasty called the Shia came from Africa to their own admission and the archaeological evidence shows it too but in the Shang Dynasty we see a second equally massive and influential wave of Africans coming to China to establish what we now know as the Shang Dynasty the dynasty that brought pretty much all the Hallmarks of what we now associate with ancient China and what did the Shang Dynasty rulers and famous figures look like they looked like this in a significant number of Shang Dynasty artifacts we see Africans depicted with all their key traits subnasal prognathism thick lips high cheekbones broad flat nose they show up on this ornate U Tigress vase or again on this 1650 BC Jade statuette of an African woman complete with the distinctive African art style still found all over the continent really incredible craftsmanship on this hard Stone shout out to the debunker for providing some amazing pictures do check out his and quy Mika's channel the level of research that is coming out of Black History Channel on YouTube would have made Diop and Van CA proud and on this 1600 BC Jade statuettes another favorite piece of mine is the dahi ding again on this piece not just the expertise in bronze work but also the unmistakable ethnicity of the portrayed figure are highlighted and just just like in Greek texts the Chinese have many references to black people in The Mists according to the book of jyn Chinese emperor Xiao of Jinn was the son of a black woman named Lee lingrong at that time she Lee lingrong was a palace servant in the weaving Workshop she was tall in shape and black in color everyone in the palace called her kunlun kunlun also refers to a far away land or again in the right of Joe more than a millennia after the arrival of the second wave of Africans to China it is reported that a whole nation within China was black quote at the second place is rivers and lakes sichan Z its animals are scaly its plants are oily and its people are black and oily end quote and they also show up in archaeological skeletal remains in large numbers from the Shia first dynasty in China to the Shang second Dynasty in China before eventually being replaced by the Joe third dynasty in China it is this last Dynasty that was in type and that came to replace all previous population types in China negroid skeletons dating to the early periods of Southern Chinese history have been found in shangdong jantong Sichuan yunan Pearl River delta and Jang XI especially at the initial sites of chingen gang chinglen Kong and majab bang machia Pang phases C KC Chang the archaeology of ancient China performed from Yale University the Chingling gang culture is often referred to as the taena Dau culture of North China the presence of negroid skeletal remains at dnu sites make it clear that Negroes spread out from the North to South China the Dau culture predates the lungshan culture which is associated with the Shia civilization so this means that the dominant cranial type found in the early and pre-dynastic era of China preia and Gia dynasties were [Music] africoid even the term Le Min used by the Joe Dynasty to indicate the founders of the Chinese civilization translates to blackheaded people an Appalachian that is shared with the sumeo Acadian term sag gigga also translating to the blackheaded people we have already covered how early Sumerians were unmistakenly black in previous videos so it is interesting to see that halfway across the world we find this same appalation again and this time used by the Joe Dynasty on The Originators of Chinese civilization and the names or title of many of the early Shang Dynasty Kings also showed a black origin from Jang Wang meaning black king Jang D meaning black Emperor and many others but if you have been following our channel for some time you know that this is not surprising and that human phenotypes change rapidly to adapt to environmental pressures enabling better adapted people to thrive within the span of a few Millennia and that flow and travel of new genes into different regions of the globe happened far quicker than previously thought and allowed for them to be tested over a few Generations also note that these specific waves of African seeding of Chinese civilization are different from the earlier wave of Negros black who came much earlier unlike the Shia and Shang wave the Negros did not bring key civilizing elements with them that we can detect from the historical record as we have seen the Chinese left a multitude of historical records about the presence and influence of the African but when they did so they used an all too familiar way of writing to do [Music] so in 1990 BC the god king fushi bestowed onto the land that was to become the Empire of the middle government domestication cooking philosophy rule of law Monument building as well as kanj the system writing these injections of culture set into motion the Great Wheel that was to become the empire Empire of China as its first emperor we must ask where did he and the people he belongs to come from where did he draw his wealth of knowledge and culture from before we go back to the genetic osteologic bone studies cultural and historical evidence let us first cover the often ignored evidence of the similarities between Chinese characters and hieroglyphics and here the similarities are once more too numerous to attribute to chance let us begin with the fact that both both writing systems use logograms these systems of writing use symbols or signs to convey meaning for a whole word we have seen this before in our video where we reviewed the evidence that multiple Mesoamerican writing systems have their roots in the ktic hieroglyphics we see the same pattern again here where a very large number of words can be seen to have the same logos the same symbols as the medu Neer the ktic writing system these representations and similarities are more pronounced as we go further back in time see how the representations of sky and Sun are virtually identical or similar in Roots to their Egyptian counterpart also notice how the older version of the Chinese characters look even closer to medu Ure in some instances the symbols are pretty much interchangeable see the ancient Egyptian logos for child and that of the Chinese and there are a lot more if I have enough funding I would love to commission a cladogram a philogenetic study between the Chinese writing system and ancient Egyptian I think the results would be fascinating I'll leave the links in the description for you to explore and if you want to support us in this effort further to the identical form and meaning of these characters Chinese is also written top to bottom and independent forms of writing that are top to bottom are very rare but it so happens that hieroglyphics also falls within that category as it can be written top to bottom but also left to right and right to left the Aztec writing system is also top to bottom but we have already covered in other videos how Mesoamerican civilization were kickstarted by the Africans from Kemet see our previous episodes on this a particular aspect of ancient Chinese culture that has endured to this day is the tradition of excellence and Artistry in its calligraphy system the refined calligraphy of the Chinese writing mimics the tradition of perfection ISM in writing hieroglyphics so Chinese writing system didn't just borrow the characters and their meaning from chemet but they also inherited its Essence and its art but if ancient Chinese writing is a derivative of hieroglyphics who brought it to China and did they bring anything [Music] else pyramids pyramids of Plenty 100 pyramids in the area of shei in central China this evidence is very consequential because soon after the pyramid building experience from Kemet begins and as black people are shown to be moving East in around 2500 BC pyramids and mastabas are appearing in central China at the end of the second world war us aircore pilot named James gausman claimed to have seen a gigantic white Jewel topped pyramid while flying between India and China during World War II but his statement was kept a closely guarded secret of the US military for 45 years before it became public knowledge all the way back in the Shia Dynasty China was building pyramids and some even larger than the Great Pyramid of Giza this points to the fact that the leaders at the time had access to a significant amount of Labor that means even back in this remote period China already had large population probably thanks to the Agricultural Revolution brought about by the Africans at the top of the Shang Dynasty but the similarities to Kemet don't stop there the ancient Chinese also practiced mummification in fact one of the best preserved mummies is Lady Dy from the Han Dynasty in 206 ad or like this 700-year-old mummy discovered by chance in Eastern China we witness the hand of the Africans again China just like Egypt Egypt also performed sarcophagus burials for their kings just look at these magnificent tombs from Chinese 6th Century Emperors and compare them to the Egyptian king sarcophagus let's remember that the oldest sarcophagus in Egypt dates back to 2613 BC at the time of the building of the pyramids so the kdic tradition would have been much older and thus the originator ancient Chinese afterlife is also borrowed from the comedic concept of afterlife ancient Chinese believed that the spirit or Soul would continue as they had in life this mimics exactly what the ancient Egyptian believed and practiced in fact just like the Old Kingdom ketu the ancient Chinese nobility would accompany the Dead with their servants and slaves along with other personal belongings a practice that was later discontinued in Kemet in Kemet it was frequent to bury the dead with their board games and their boat the egyp gyptians believed that it would help their soul travel to the afterlife many ancient Chinese Graves had had board games and chariots instead but the cultural motifs are identical pyramids sarcophagus burying of belongings vessels for the afterlife again the similarities are too significant to be dismissed and we can see how the ancient from the nubio kdic civilization complex especially its ruling class sparked the early Chinese civilization this even extends to the scribes The Scribe was also very important in both civilizations but also the concept of the god king both taken from the ancient Egyptians even the concept of ancestor worship that the Chinese started to practice in dynastic times came from the Africans another very interesting fact is that the Shang Dynasty the founding dynasty of China practiced the African Child naming convention by assigning names corresponding to the weekday they were born for for example in Ghana the Ashanti still name their kids kufu Kujo quame and so forth which are old comedic names from their migration all the way back in ancient Kemet to the Ghana Empire situated in Mali to their present Kingdom this practice was also present in the ancient Chinese Shang Dynasty another coincidence between Kemet and China is that their calendars were somewhat similar Chinese calendar is described as a Luna solar calendar calendar just like its older comedic counterpart but one question Still Remains was it just a cultural influence or did a large contingent of kemu ancient Egyptians settle in China in the Bronze [Music] Age to begin we must understand how ancient China started and the dynasties that created it there are three founding dynasties in ancient China the xia dynasty 1900 to 1700 BC Shang Yin Dynasty 1700 to 1050 BC and the Joe Dynasty the Joe dynasty was the first dynasty founded by the people in China the Shia and Shang dynasties are said to have been founded by a people who came from the West those who have been called the Naki the n Kei which translates to na black key man this would imply the first two oldest dynasties of China the ones that brought in the foundations of their civilization including writing and pyramid building were black African or at the least ruled by black people from the West that black civilization as we have seen from research covered in previous videos spanned from the Western Sahara to chemet Egypt Asia Minor and as we shall see today Far East that is China the same Nubian stock that started the Greek rusans and Sumerian civilization there is now a very large body of evidence skeletal evidence written account artistic depictions and oral history that shows that well into the Bronze Age a very powerful black civilization ruled from Western Sahara all the way to Levant the Middle East southeast Asia China and Japan throughout all these lands numerous skeletal remains and antecedants depicted clearly africoid gods are present they even crossed the Atlantic and helped seed civilization in meso America as we have seen in our previous videos If ever there was a case for an Atlantean civilization that was spreading technology and KN how to the whole world that would be that civilization of black people which lasted from 12,000 BC when africoid black people discovered agriculture in the Levant and spread it around the known world ancient Egypt was but a division of this ancient civilization as their own text attest but this is a topic for another day the first Chinese emperor Shang Tang the ruler of the Nai the black men brought about several totems of civilization China among his credits are establishing government and originating social institutions as well as cultural inventions Emperor Tang is believed to have ruled from in 1600 and started the Shang Dynasty by overthrowing the last king of the Shia Dynasty amongst the many rulers in China Shang Tang is notable for the inventions he brought forth he is said to be the originator of the iing the book of change it is among the oldest and most revered system of philosophy Emperor hung Wu was founder of the great Ming dynasty of China and there are indications that these early rulers were black revered as God Kings and then elevated to mythical figures similar to Osiris and Imhotep even in the white garment Hall Of The Shaolin Monastery in honen Hunan Province of China there are two 12 foot long paintings of Chinese and africoid black Shaolin Monks training in kung fu boxing skills together so what are some of the references to black people's presence in consistent rulership and deification in ancient China in South southeast Asia and Southern China ancient skeletal remains represented the earliest inhabitants to be ostr loids and negrillo negrito by the beginning of the present Holocene period the population in China could be differentiated and placed into categories designating in the north and oceanic on black races in the South both of these groups evolved out of a common upper Pine substratum as represented by the tuang and luchian skulls more importantly is that by at least 2500 BC africoid of the Mediterranean and West African type entered this area by way of India the skeletal evidence from the shantong and kiangsu China show the modern africoid type especially at the initial chinglen King and machang phases notice that 2500 BC also happens to fall in the Old Kingdom of Kemet and the height of pyramid building other ancient Chinese sources Des describ the wealthy monare who ruled the ancient kingdoms of chamba fan and Kaa Lin Yi as having curly hair and black skin we see this description often in ancient text when referring to black people these are some of the clear phenotypes of black people from Africa and these appear in multiple instances throughout China and Asia as a whole the skeletal evidence of the africoid people have been located in majab bang Chingling gang Jang XI Pearl River delta yunan Sichuan janong and shangdong areas the black people are said to have heavily influenced the culture of the northern China most of the northern China's africoid are said to have come from East and West Africa till this day there is strong resemblance between the ethnic Chinese and the Central African kisan h imber a French scholar in 1928 in Les nritto dasin observed that in the first epics of Chinese history the negrito type peopled all the south of this country and even the island of hyan as we have attempted to prove in our study on the Negros or black men of the Land There are many references to these black people in Chinese literature according to T de laari the chines first met these tribes in 2116 BC when they Advanced eastwards of the Great Southern Bend of the Yellow River they are spoken of in the Joe Lee composed under the Joe Dynasty 1122 249 BC as black and oily skinned in 122 BC prince leonan who died in 122 BC speaks of references of blacks in China as late as the Tang Dynasty in the Lino Chan contained in book 197 of the chuang Shu it is is written that the people living to the south of lyi have woolly hair and black skin in addition to the above Chinese folklore mentions an Empress of China named Lee 373 397 ad who was the consort of the emperor xia wuan was black in addition to fighting the Y the Joe also conquered the negritos of southern China they defeated some but not all of the negrito kingdoms especially in yunan the Chinese called the NGO blacks man and Kun L many of these blacks presently live in coochin China and yunan the Shia people came in contact with these black inhabitants in 2116 BC they are mentioned in the Joe Lee as living along the Yellow River the name of the yangi River Basin area were also constantly at war with the Joe the N were closely related to the Tibetans of Chuan at this time the man states were ruled by princes the the arrival of black people in China in ancient times was significant enough in the Bronze Age to show up with such a high frequency in the literature and art of ancient and more recent historical China but their presence also shows up in many other ways when Professor Jin Lee set out to prove that Chinese people descended from a different lineage of the homog gene pool his study led him to in fact confirm that all without exception all Chinese people are descended from black people and I quote we did not see even one single individual that could be considered as a descendant of homo erectus in China rather everybody was a descendant from our ancestors in Africa end quote in time the ethnic Chinese just like the mesoamericans went on to create an equally impressive civilization That Grew large and strong from their ktic seating the contribution of the Africans however in the early days of China is now understood to have been decisive before I leave you I would like to share with you this snippet from the YouTube channel called African History station welcome to this episode picture this hypothetical exchange which is based on accurate established historical facts a young Nigerian named osazuwa was sent by his parents to Tokyo in Japan to attend University there a few years back when he arrived in Tokyo he made friends with the local Japanese student at his university and of course told them his name oaza when he did they looked at him in shock and said to him are you joking that's a pure Japanese name and he said to them of course it's not Japanese I'm from the Edo ethnic group in Nigeria and the friends looked at him in even greater shock and said to him what did you just say your ethnic group was he repeated Edo and then they said to him you've got to be kidding Edo is the former name of Tokyo this city we are in right right now Edo is the former name of Japan it's also the name of the Edo Empire which reigned over Japan for centuries now the Edo period of Japan was from 16003 to 1867 and was an era of military government the dynasty was established by military commanders osazuwa or Osa for short was a history Enthusiast and he asked them who started the Edo Empire in Japan and they said he was a military commander named yasu Osa was in total shock the title of the military commander of the edu Empire I.E the Ben Empire of Nigeria who was second in power only to the king himself was IAS as they chattered further one of the Japanese looked up into the night sky and commented on the unusually bright moon or susuki and also asked him what did you just call the moon Suki he replied and then oosa said in Edo we call the moon Uki and they looked at him in pure astonishment and then he added Uki is also the name we use for beauty the Japanese kids stood both upright as they screamed and sukii is a name we also use for beauty as they wandered aloud in amazement an elderly Japanese man walked up to them to ask for directions and the Japanese students greeted him by saying respectfully Dore Dore Ola heard them and nearly fell off his chair he said that's exact L how we greet Elders in edland we say DMO make sure you follow him for excellent coverage of African history [Music] narrative one thing is certain is that history
