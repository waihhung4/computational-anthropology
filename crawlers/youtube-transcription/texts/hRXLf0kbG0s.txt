[Music] hey everyone welcome to this edition of history with psy in this episode I want to talk about some of the cities that we've mentioned in past programs just to give you a little bit more of a historical background to some of the events that we've already covered for now we'll take a look at some of the earliest cities of ancient Sumer in future programs we'll cover two other cities of old Babylonia and Assyria so let's begin [Music] we'll start first with Erie do according to the Sumerian king list Erie do was the first city and home of the first king of the world alula the patron deity of Erie do was Anki the god of fresh waters and wisdom who was known to help out mankind much like prometheus in Greek mythology archaeologists have determined that an key shrine any we do was built and rebuilt many times over the centuries with the earliest level dating to around 5500 BCE this not only predates the arrival of the Sumerians but also makes it the oldest temple that we know about well the first temple was likely less than 20 square meters and had little more than a small altar by 2100 BCE a large ziggurat which is the type of Step Pyramid temple was built over the original structure probably due to the shifting course of the Euphrates River over the centuries sometime around the mid 2nd millennium BCE Garuda was mostly abandoned still it's held its plays in Sumerian and Babylonian lore as one of the oldest and most sacred places in the world [Music] one of the most well known and remarkable cities of the ancient world Orick may have been the first really large urban center in history in fact it's from this city that the modern country of Iraq gets its name according to Sumerian tradition work was established by a king named mezquia gasher perhaps as early as 5000 BCE however Horrocks period of greatest growth and prosperity came in the fourth millennium BCE when it grew into something resembling a metropolis it had palaces gardens workshops for artisans housing blocks for its growing population and of course many temples the most famous of which was Yana the temple dedicated to the goddess of love in Anna in the Akkadian language her name is Ishtar Oryx other claims to fame well it's where writing was first developed or at least where examples of it have been uncovered the city was also home to the hero Gilgamesh star of the most famous piece of ancient Sumerian and later Babylonian literature the Epic of Gilgamesh though going through ups and downs the city surprisingly had a great deal of longevity though by the 1st millennium BCE its glory days were behind it auric was still inhabited and even prosperous during the neo-babylonian persian Seleucid partying and even sasanian periods its decline occurred around 500 and by 630 it's believed to have been pretty much abandoned though today in ruins Brookes contribution to the world cannot be understated [Music] next we come to the great city of or like auric this city is steeped with history and was one of the most important cities of ancient Sumer and Babylonia for a few thousand years it's also the terrestrial home of the moon-god Nana who an Akkadian is called sin at one time when the ancient Persian Gulf was much more inland it was a thriving seaport and this made it a major trade hub inhabited since at least 4500 BCE the cities rise to prominence began around 20 750 BCE with two of its early Kings Missoni para and his son a Anna pada it was during this time that oars rule expanded to conquer many of its neighbors including the wealthy and powerful cities of Kish and Lagash or his initial period of power and prosperity ended around 2300 BCE with its conquest by the Akkadian warlord and King Sargon of Akkad who later on was known as Sargon the great however after the fall of the Akkadian Empire or once again became the center and capital of the great neo Sumerian Empire ruled by what historians call the third dynasty of war beginning with or now mu and continuing with his successors shogi a Marsan shusun and the last neo Sumerian king a beasts in the Empire revived Sumerian culture and controlled large areas of the ancient Middle East from the Mediterranean to the borders of what is now eastern iran the most famous monument from this time was Orr's great ziggurat the ruins of which are still visible and honestly quite impressive even to this day despite the Empire's eventual demise due to a series of factors or maintained its position as an important center of pilgrimage for worshippers of the moon-god Nana however with the course of the Euphrates River slowly changing the city's agricultural production declined and by around 450 BCE the city's residents had largely abandoned it for greener pastures elsewhere [Music] in terms of holiness there were few if any cities that compared with nip or like Erie do and Orick its foundations also seem to go back to the 6th millennium BCE being a religious Center Newport is not known to have ever had a ruling dynasty of its own and so officially it was politically neutral however no king of ancient Sumer and later Babylonia could be considered legitimate unless he supported the city with funds and temple renovations or at least made a pilgrimage to nib or nippers patron deity was Enlil whose Iker or mountain house was possibly the most holy temple in all of Sumer along with the II Corps there were several other major temples especially to the goddess Anana [Music] Kish was another old and once powerful city of ancient Sumer whose patron deity was the warrior God zubaba according to the Sumerian king list it's the place where the first royal dynasty arose following the event known as the Great Flood while the kingless gives the names of many early kings of Kish only - and me bug Raz and his son Agha have been somewhat confirmed by archaeological evidence one fascinating fact is that according to the Sumerian king list the establishment of Kings third dynasty was a woman named kou baba it's actually quite an anomaly because all of the other ancient sumerian rulers that we know of were men speaking of rulers arguably the most famous king or emperor of ancient mesopotamia that is Sargon the great was born in the city of Kish the city was also known for its scholarly tradition and as a center of learning throughout the ancient world for centuries until its eventual decline and abandonment in the fifth or sixth century [Music] next we come to the city state or kingdom of lagash which was actually made up of a trio of cities Lagash Gere sue and Nina Sahara there are a few cities of the ancient Sumerian world that are historically as significant as Lagash located not far from ancient sewers fluid border with Alam lagash was a conduit for trade between ancient Mesopotamia and the east this of course made it extremely wealthy and allowed it to expand and dominate many of the other cities of ancient Sumer Lagash is patron deity wasn't in gear sue the god of farming was also a warrior God his main temple was a neighboring gear suit which we'll get to shortly one of lagash his most famous early rulers was or nanshy who is believed to have ruled around 2500 BCE he's credited with numerous accomplishments including the construction of many of the city's temples public squares and it's great defensive walls his grandson Ian autumn was also really famous perhaps even more so though like his grandfather he built many temples and expanded Lagasse's network of canals he's best known for being a great warrior and bringing the city-states great rival OMA into submission this once perennial conflict between the two is depicted on the famous steely of the vultures currently in the Louvre the Anathem even claimed to have conquered many cities of Elom to the east technically making lagash the international superpower of its day the good times though didn't last and around 2340 BCE lagash was eventually defeated and more or less destroyed by the king of oma lugol's Agassi better days though would come for the city under the enlightened king judea ruling between 2141 to 2122 BCE judea and rich sluggish and the neighboring city of gear su after the fall of the Akkadian Empire making it a great center of Sumerian culture and art a few decades later though Lagash was incorporated into the Neo Sumerian Empire based in or after which it ceased to play a significant role in the affairs of the region about 15 kilometers from the gosh was gear sooo another great center of Sumerian culture at one time believed to have been part of the gosh gear su was in fact distinct and eventually the city's role was primarily a religious one this is because it was the home of the great temple to the god ming gear su the god who aided farmers and overall watched over the land it's here that the famous steely of the vultures was found along with over 40,000 cuneiform tablets from the city's old archives in addition there have been several beautifully carved statues out of diorite of the famous king judea that have been found amongst its ruins the third great urban center of the city-state of lagash was Nina tsurara toning gear su was a popular God here Nina sir Aras patron was the goddess nan Chi the city's prime was during the early dynastic period under Ian autumn though it also became prosperous during GU Diaz reign as king of lagash other than that not much else is known about the city finally we come to allagash is great rival the city of Goma this was the city of the warrior God sharra that God is probably a good fit for the city because we often hear of OMA in Sumerian documents in the context of its perennial conflict with lagash this is the city that was defeated by Ian autumn of lagash only to vanquish lagash gear su Denis Aurora several centuries later under lugol's Agassi however after Lu Gaza gazes defeat and the city's conquest by Sargon the great Ouma more or less falls off the stage of history and we don't really hear about it after that so there you have some of the major cities of ancient Sumer during the early dynastic period these are by no means the only cities there were other notable ones that occupied the Sumerian world including a Dobb shahrukh book and several others however the ones we went over were arguably the most important and are mentioned the most often in Sumerian and later texts so this concludes our current list in future we'll talk about the other cities specifically of old Babylonia and Assyria thanks again for tuning in I hope you learned something and if you did please like the video and subscribe to the channel hope to see you next time take care
