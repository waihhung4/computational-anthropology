very quick look at the sumerians if you'd like to test your knowledge of this material at the end check out the short quiz via the link in the video description i know your time's precious so let's begin the sumerians were a people of ancient mesopotamia whose civilization flourished in what's today southern iraq in the 3rd millennium bc we today called the land that they occupied sumer which is derived from the word sumerum the acadian language name for their homeland however the sumerians called their country kyengir and themselves sagiga meaning the black-headed people the origins of the sumerians specifically where they came from is one of those perplexing questions that archaeologists and historians just can't seem to definitively answer showing up in the archaeological record in the 4th millennium bc were they newcomers to the region or did they just simply evolve out of the existing indigenous peoples who were already there it's hard to know based simply on archaeological evidence analysis of the sumerian language also reveals that it's unlike any other known to have existed what we do know is that by the early bronze age the sumerian language had become the dominant form of communication throughout much of the region though there were several other earlier settlements in various parts of the world the sumerians are credited with constructing the first real cities two of these cities which may have been established around 4 500 bc if not earlier were eridu and uruk within a few centuries sumer became dotted with several other urban centers including orr nippur adab lagash and uma these cities eventually took up the characteristics of small countries and for this reason we call them city-states eventually these city-states transitioned into what scholars and historians call the early dynastic period of sumer which spanned from approximately 2 900 to 2334 bc for the most part these sumerian city-states had several things in common for one they were generally along the tigris and euphrates rivers or one of their many branches they also had high walls to protect the temples palaces administrative buildings streets houses and of course the people that lived within them at the center of nearly all of them was a large religious sanctuary known as a ziggurat which was a step-like pyramid structure and the tallest building in each city in addition each city-state controlled acres of farmland that were lined with canals and dotted with supporting villages another important aspect of sumerian city-states was that each had a specific patron deity or a god or goddess that in theory protected or presided over the city sumerian religion was polytheistic meaning that its adherents believed in more than one god or goddess for example the god of the moon nana was the patron deity of the city of ur where as inanna the goddess of love fertility and also war was the patron deity of uruk though occupying the spiritual world and generally separated from the affairs of humans the respective city-state of each deity was considered to be its terrestrial home on a practical level running the day-to-day affairs of the city-state and surrounding areas was ultimately the responsibility of mere mortals at the top of the sumerian hierarchy was a ruler called in ensi meaning lord or in some cases especially if he ruled over more than one city alugal meaning great man basically they were like kings initially their power and importance were relatively limited since most authority in the city-state was exercised by the temple priesthood as time went on there became a greater separation between religious and secular authority with a number of rulers becoming so powerful that they were able to extend their influence over neighboring city-states one of the most famous examples of this was king eonatam of the city-state of lagash when the 25th or 24th century bc not only expelled elamite invaders from sumer but also ended up conquering the rival city-states of ur uruk lagash kish and a few others one of the best known sources of information on sumerian political history is what's known as the sumerian king list compiled by scribes over the course of several centuries the sumerian kinglist records the names of many of the rulers and dynasties of the various city-states and kingdoms of sumer in addition the list also alludes to which city-states were the most powerful during a particular time period the earliest rulers on the list most of whom were mythical kings and heroes were said to have ruled for tens of thousands of years which obviously isn't true the document's value to scholars really comes from analyzing the latter centuries of the list the kings here were actual historical figures whose existence has been corroborated by archaeological evidence several versions of the sumerian king list have been found with the oldest one dating to the second millennium bc though many details of their civilization are still murky there's no doubt that the sumerians were an extremely innovative people from what archaeologists have uncovered so far it's clear that sumerian city-states were able to organize their societies in a way that fostered a high degree of cooperation ultimately leading to many large scale projects such as the building and maintenance of city walls temples and complex irrigation systems one of the most famous as well as practical inventions was the development of the world's first known written script we call this writing system cuneiform initially such writing was produced by pressing the ends of a wedge-shaped reed into soft wet clay tablets which were then dried and hardened in the sun though seemingly cumbersome cuneiform tablets could last for centuries if not millennia to date tens of thousands of cuneiform clay tablets have been uncovered by archaeologists from all over sumer the vast majority of these are administrative records business contracts ledgers and accounts of various commodities however a number of these tablets also contain hymns prayers the inscriptions of kings early law codes and even epic poetry the most famous one being the epic of gilgamesh around 2330 bc sumer was conquered in its entirety by an acadian king named sargon the great despite the acadian language becoming the official one especially for administrative purposes sumerian was still widely spoken by the majority of people in sumer shortly after the demise of sargon's acadian dynasty around 2200 bc sumerian once again became the official language of the region under what are known as the neo-sumerian kings of the third dynasty of ur these kings did much to revive the culture language and traditions of sumer's early dynastic period a time that they deemed to be the glory years of sumerian civilization like that of the akkadian kings the rule of the neo-sumerian dynasty declined and eventually collapsed in 2004 bc by then newcomers each with their own culture and traditions had already entered the region effectively changing the ethnic and linguistic makeup of sumer by 1800 bc sumerian had ceased to exist as a spoken language a new society was being formed that mixed sumerian culture with those of the acadian and amorite speaking peoples to create what we today know as babylonian civilization despite this sumerian maintained its prestige as a literary and liturgical language that was still taught in scribal schools perhaps up until the second or first century bc and of course the sumerians influence on babylonian and ancient assyrian culture and religion pervaded both societies throughout their existence so i hope that this short video gave you a glimpse into the world of ancient sumer and the sumerians if you'd like to test your
