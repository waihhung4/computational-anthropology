name and achilles one of the greatest greek warriors who is immortalized in homer's iliad though great tales the epic of gilgamesh and similar stories are no closer to proving the actual existence of gilgamesh than homer's iliad proves that achilles existed and fought in the trojan war however many scholars of ancient history would argue that it's more likely that there was a king of uruk named gilgamesh than a hero who fought a troy named achilles this is due to really one piece of evidence gilgamesh appears on an ancient document known as the sumerian king list along with him are 132 other kings and one queen who have been listed as the rulers of ancient mesopotamia from what the sumerians would have considered to have been the dawn of history up until the third dynasty of or around 2000 bc the most complete sumerian king list ever to have been discovered is from the site of the ancient city of larsa and dates to around 1800 bc it was first compiled by various sumerian scribes over the course of several centuries in an effort to record the many rulers of the various kingdoms of the region over time other peoples including babylonians assyrians and even elamites created their own kingless the scribes not only listed individual names but also grouped them into ruling dynasties and stated the cities that they ruled from the belief in those days was that the land was essentially united but that different cities throughout its history starting with eridu and moving to other cities such as uruk ur kish zipar or agade just to name a few eventually took over the mantle of kingship as decreed by heaven in the poem the lament over or enlil the greatest and most powerful of the gods tells nana the god of the moon and patron deity of the city of ur the following oor was given kingship but it was not given in eternal reign from time immemorial since the land was founded until the people multiplied who has ever seen a reign of kingship that would take precedence forever the reign of kingship has been long indeed but it had to exhaust itself historically what had happened was that the neo-sumerian state based in ur had collapsed but the final nail in the coffin being the destruction or at least occupation of the city by neighboring elamite forces the poem and others like it gave a theological justification for not just such a calamity but also why dynasties no matter how great can never rule forever the rule of each dynasty and city was only temporary and whenever the gods decided that it should move to another people or place it did such had been going on since the beginning of history at least that's what the authors of the sumerian king list wanted the reader to believe [Music] the king list opens with the following verses [Music] after kingship descended from heaven the kingship was in eridu in eredu alulam became king he ruled for 28 800 years al-algar ruled for 36 thousand years two kings they ruled for a total of sixty four thousand eight hundred years then eredu fell and the kingship was taken to bad tibirah in bad tibira and meluana ruled for 43 200 years en min gelana ruled for 28 800 years dumuzi the shepherd ruled for 36 000 years in sum three kings reigned for one hundred and eight thousand years of course the lengths of these reigns are humanly impossible tens of thousands of years and one of the so-called kings de musi may have even been one of the sumerian gods who ruled for a while it's safe to say they're purely mythical figures however the further down the list we go that is the closer to our era the more believable and possibly verifiable the list becomes for example the earliest ruler in the sumerian king list whose existence has been verified by archaeology is enmen bagaresi a king of the city of kish the kingless states enmin bagarezi who destroyed elam's weapons became king he ruled for 900 years aga son of enmin bagaresi ruled for 625 years archaeologists have uncovered inscriptions of a ruler of kish named enmin bagarezi who also had a son named aga in fact he dedicated a temple in the holy city of nipur though he didn't rule for 900 years he did reign during the beginning of what we'd call the early dynastic period of sumer or roughly from 2900 to 2700 bc assuming that he's the same person one might wonder why the scribes gave him a reign of 900 years honestly we don't know but i often think about it like this just like modern archaeologists and historians have to piece together the history of ancient mesopotamia from incomplete and damaged texts or in many cases lack of such texts the sumerian scribes who put together the first king list most likely had the same problem they probably had to also fill in the missing details with whatever little evidence they had come across and ultimately used this to come to their own conclusions it's possible that in the absence of any written documents they simply relied on oral tradition which in the case of edmund bagaresi may have somehow in their collective memory been 900 years we'll probably never know for sure how this and other numbers for extremely long reigns came about as i mentioned earlier gilgamesh the well-known hero of the epic poem that bears his name the epic of gilgamesh is listed as the fifth ruler of the first dynasty of uruk his passage in the text reads gilgamesh whose father was an invisible being the lord of kulaba ruled for 126 years ur nungal the son of the divine gilgamesh ruled for 30 years like with other early kings even those who may have been historical we have a problem as to when gilgamesh actually ruled scholars have placed his possible existence to anywhere between 2900 and 2500 bc with sumerian kinglists early political events are almost impossible to date as there are many gaps and errors in the various versions as well as a few contradictions in addition the dynasties are listed one after another as if they followed some sort of chronological order whereas in reality it's almost certain that many of them overlapped with one dynasty ruling in one city-state while another ruled simultaneously in a neighboring city-state however sumerian kinglists are also very helpful especially with putting together the later dynasties and political history of the region for example the lists do tell us the chronological order of the rulers of each dynasty not only this but the shorter and more realistic reigns of these kings have been corroborated and cross-examined with other unrelated texts and archaeological findings let's take a look at some of the later entries on the list if you're somewhat familiar with the history of ancient mesopotamia or have seen a good number of videos on this channel you'll probably recognize several of them then kish was defeated and the kingship was taken to uruk in uruk lugal zaghzi became king he ruled for 25 years one king ruled for 25 years then uruk was defeated and the kingship was taken to agade inagade sargon whose father was a gardener the cupbearer of urza baba became king the king of agade who built agade he ruled for 56 years remoush son of sargon ruled for nine years manish tushu the older brother of rimoush son of sargon ruled for 15 years naram sin son of manishtushu ruled for 56 years shah khali shari son of naram sin ruled for 25 years then who was king who was not king ir gigi was king nanum was king eemi was king ilulu was king those four kings ruled three years these last few lines starting with then who was king who was not king indicate the breakdown of authority in much of mesopotamia at the time it's the period when other texts tell us that the guti or gutiens were causing havoc throughout the land in reality the situation was a bit more complicated than that there were probably several factors including widespread drought and starvation it's likely that the gutians still hadn't become the dominant force because the kingless then mentions a dynasty from uruk this implies that after the fall of agade uruk became the dominant power in mesopotamia how much power the kings of oro had isn't known as there were only five kings within a span of 30 years which is generally not a good indication of political stability the kingless reads then agade was defeated and the kingship was taken to uruk in uruk ur nigen became king he ruled for seven years son of ornigan ruled for six years kuda ruled for six years puzur ili ruled for five years ur utu ruled for six years five kings ruled for thirty years after this we have the dynasty of gutiem and gutien rule of the region uruk was defeated and the kingship was taken to the army of gutiem the army of gutiem a king whose name is unknown nibiya became king he ruled for three years then in gishu ruled for six years ikukumla kaba ruled for six years shulmi ruled for six years and the list for the dynasty of gutien goes on until it tells us 21 kings who ruled for 91 years and 40 days the average reign here is less than two and a half years again indicating that this was not the most stable time in the lands of sumer and akkad perhaps these were not kings at all but possibly governors since the text gives us several names but no lineages it's hard to believe that a single dynasty could have survived by changing so many kings in such a relatively short period of time finally we come to the third dynasty of ur the neo-sumerian kings during whose time the list was probably first compiled and later copied for mass production here's also where a lot of other archaeological findings correspond with the information given in the list then the army of gutien was defeated and the kingship was taken to uruk in uruk uttuhegal became king he ruled for seven years six months and seven days one king ruled for seven years six months and seven days then uruk was defeated and the kingship was taken to ur in or ur namu became king he ruled for 18 years shulgi son of urnamu ruled for 46 years amar sin son of shulgi ruled for nine years shu sin son of amarsin ruled for nine years ibisin son of shusin ruled for 24 years five kings ruled for 108 years so like many of us today the peoples of ancient mesopotamia the sumerians acadians assyrians and others all took pains to record their early history as accurately as they possibly could with the exception perhaps of the earliest dynasties which in all honesty they wouldn't have been able to have verified anyway so i hope that you learned a bit about the sumerian king list and perhaps why it's important or at least valuable
