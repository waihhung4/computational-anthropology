ancient mesopotamia have all heard of the cities of uruk ur and babylon these cities are all extremely old but there's one at least according to sumerian myth and legend that's the oldest of them all eredu after the kingship descended from heaven the kingship was an eredo in eredu alulam became king he ruled for twenty eight thousand eight hundred years al-algar ruled for thirty six thousand years two kings they ruled for a total of sixty four thousand 800 years then eredu fell and the kingship was taken to bad tabira [Music] these are the words from a document known as the sumerian king list which gives according to sumerian tradition not just the first rulers of the world but also the respective cities that they ruled from though we have no way of proving any of this for the sumerians the king list outlined part of their history and according to it the first king ruled from eredu not just this but sumerian and later babylonian tradition also states that along with being the first kingdom eredu was the first city ever to have been established on earth archaeologists though are not so sure as most contend that jericho is much older even in mesopotamia the urban center of uruk was likely to have been the first to have obtained city status however the site of eredu may have contained a modest settlement before that of uruk archaeologists have determined that eredu may have been inhabited as far back as 8000 bc that's 10 000 years ago the site of eredu consists of seven mounds that are today located on the floodplains of southern iraq excavations first began in 1854 and continued periodically up until 1949. though a lot of pottery shards ceramic objects and tools were found one of the highlights of these excavations was the sequence of 18 superimposed successive layers of a temple dating from approximately 6000 bc at the earliest level to about 3000 bc for the most recent one initially the temple was a simple room no larger than three square meters with an altar at one end and a stand upon which the ashes and traces of fish bones were discovered these were believed to have been offerings dedicated to the one who would eventually become the patron deity of eredu the god enki in sumerian religion and mythology enki is the god of fresh waters and knowledge in the third millennium bc arudu became an important sumerian city-state though not considered to be as powerful as its neighbors namely the city-states of uruk ur and lagash eredu was revered as a religious center by the general sumerian population and due to this many kings from outside the city lavished its temples with all sorts of extravagance for example king ornamu the founder of the powerful third dynasty of war and the neo-sumerian empire built a large ziggurat and renovated the temple dedicated to enki such traditions were continued by other kings for at least the next 1500 years with notable rulers on record being the assyrian king asher banipal and the neo-babylonian ruler nebuchadnezzar ii though a part of great empires eredu was never the center or capital of one eredu was believed to have been occupied at least up until the acamenid persian period but once the region became rapidly hellenized after 300 bc during the seleucid period it along with most of the other old cities of ancient mesopotamia were abandoned part of the reason may have been the fading importance of and lack of state sponsorship for the temple of enki but there was probably also a practical reason for the city's demise specifically lack of water as the course of the euphrates shifted and the city's religious importance waned it just didn't make sense for people to stay in eredu when there were better opportunities elsewhere and so the city was gradually abandoned and eventually fell into ruin today these ruins are in the middle of the iraqi desert where it's hard to believe that a thriving city at the edge of the persian gulf once existed to learn more about eredu
