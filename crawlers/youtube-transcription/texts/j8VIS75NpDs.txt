I think I will go ahead and start my um short introduction for Paul and then people can still be joining we have a very big crowd today which of course we could never have had at the British Academy if we were there I'm Joan Porter McKeever the vice chair of the British Institute for the study of Iraq and all of you are aware that of course Paul is our chairman and our wonderful chairman at that he's also of course at the ashmolean and he's the jillah Hearn curator of ancient near East he is the um author of many many books um I'm not going into the list you can actually find that out quite easily online but I would like to point out a few things that in March 20 um 20 2021 he did indeed um the book that you see here was um published and another book that was published was a lonely Charming little book on ancient Sumer that the ashmonine is done and dangle or education has been the sponsor of this as well as the Arabic version that's just come out we're very lucky to have Paul not only for his role as a chair but also with his scholarship that he brings to the British Institute for the study of Iraq we are a membership institution and we hope many of you who are not members will consider joining us um it's not very um burdensome in terms of your financial outgoings and it's actually very important for us to have members we are one of the uh eight institutes sponsored by the British Academy through their berries the British International research institutes abroad and that has been actually quite an important group to rejoin which we have in the last few years partially under Paul's leadership um we are about to start um the talk but I did want to point out two dates um January 20th we have our next Zoom um webinar with Dr Moody al-rasheed also a council member and then on February 16th we have our annual general meeting and Dr Augusta McMahon will be speaking um from telbrock to lagash it's quite an important lecture for us all um that actually is the 90th year of the British Institute for the study of Iraq so we are very excited to have such an important speaker speak on that date without further Ado I'm going to pass over to Paul to talk about discovering Sumerians and that is the title of his lecture thank you all very much foreign thank you very much indeed for that uh very nice introduction and um welcome everybody Welcome um to our December lecture from the British Institute for the study of Iraq and um uh very much our our Christmas gift to you um so I hope you enjoy it uh I want to explore um the Sumerians and I've done that recently in this publication which made me think about uh how we really understand who the Sumerians are where they come from and indeed how we understand them today of course what better place to start with thinking about who the Sumerians might be then with the BBC and if one goes to their website ones discovers that of course uh ancient Sumer is located in southern Iraq and traditionally they are the civilization that emerged in that region between around 3500 and 2000 BC and the BBC very hopefully then tells us that the Sumerians are responsible for some of the fundamental inventions discoveries developments in human history the Modern urban literate World in many ways um is uh credited to them so we find uh cities the wheel agriculture writing and indeed schools and then perhaps most famous of all the dividing of the hour into 60 Minutes um as a result of Sumerian civilization but the Sumerians were actually not known across the world until about 150 years ago and so in this talk I want to explore how we come to know about the Sumerians who we think they were so two questions and then I'll spend a little time discussing what we think we know about them today so as I say 150 years ago and before that time nobody had heard of the Sumerians when you were a lot about many of the other civilizations of ancient Iraq the Hebrew Bible of course recounted tales of the Assyrians of northern Mesopotamia and in southern Mesopotamia there were accounts of the Tower of Babel and by the 18th century and early 19th century these Tales had been transformed into exotic and sexualized accounts of debauchery and opulence but what about the real place and the people who lived there well the Orient as it was known the Far East beyond the Eastern Mediterranean Shore um and Mesopotamia the land between the rivers Tigris and Euphrates became of interest to the European powers in the 19th and 18th and 19th centuries especially the empires of France and Britain when they became engaged with the Ottoman Empire the Turkish Ottoman Empire that controlled this region and the empire was divided into a mosaic of provinces with Mesopotamia divided between mosul and Baghdad with a Southern province of Basra a region known of course locally and had been since at least the 8th Century um in Arabic as al-iraq well the northern regions of Mesopotamia on the Tigris close to mosul attracted the attention of antiquarians among the European merchants and diplomats and their Assyrian sites were mined for their monuments which were removed in many respects to Europe and so large collections entered the British museum in London and the Louvre in Paris this caused extraordinary excitement and the Assyrians came to play a role in in the way in which the Western European societies thought about themselves descriptions however began to arrive in Europe from explorers diplomats and Merchants from sites further south and sites like Babylon were a focus for attention those particularly along the Euphrates a few monuments were noted a colossal sculptures that lay abandoned apparently in the midst of agricultural land or in the neighboring deserts and a few fragments of sculptures were sent to London and there on the right of the screen you see drawings of inscribed sculptures a number of small pieces that were removed from a site called telhaman in 1849 by an English geologist called William Kenneth Loftus this was the first inscribed sculptures to arrive in London Loftus also engaged himself from that period in small-scale excavations and one of the sites he chose was the so-called telemokia the mound of pitch where he found more inscribed material as well as a few other objects which found their way back to Europe and it was this wedge-shaped writing that was intriguing Scholars back in Europe a few of The Monuments including colossal sculpture and again few clay objects were covered in this wedge-shaped writing and Scholars began to tackle the challenge of deciphering it it was Chief among these um was the man a great scholar Henry Rawlinson he had been employed by the East India Company and had traveled extensively through the region but particularly in Persia modern Iran where he became acquainted with Monumental inscriptions um when she with this wedge-shaped writing at various parts of the country he realized that there were three types of cuneiform script one with a limited number of signs and the other two with hundreds of signs his Focus was on the the inscriptions with the limited signs and he famously um recorded inscriptions um at the site of bisitoon or behestoun in Western Iran this whole story of rawlinson's um engagement with the cuneiform scripts particularly at better tune has entered the literature and become incredibly romanticized um Rawlinson faced we are told incredible dangers in recording the inscriptions carved on this great relief uh overlooking uh on a cliff face overlooking a major route um through the Zagros Mountains the reality however was actually very different Roland said did most of his escapades by using a telescope from the ground and any way climbing up the bessitone release is not quite as dangerous as the 1920 reconstruct and suggested as is evident from this photograph of a family happily standing beneath the inscriptions but the romanticizing of rawlinson's escapades um created an idea that he was the father of the challenge of translating the wedge-shaped writing the real credit for this however should go to this man the Reverend Edward hinks Vicar In kalilei County Down Ireland a brilliant philologist a brilliant linguist who between his pastoral duties undertook major translation work um with of languages around the world and he decided to try and Tackle this wedge-shaped script that was being found at numerous sites across Mesopotamia and Iran and it was he in 1846 that recognized that the cuneiform script as was being recorded was actually syllabic that the individual wedge-shaped signs represented sound values and you get a sense of the variety of signs and their their sound values in this chart the inscriptions from Babylonia and Assyria that were now arriving at the British museum in their hundreds um were a source of information for hinks and by studying some of them he recognized that what he was reading was a Semitic language that the these wedge-shaped signs recorded a language with this a grammar similar to modern day Hebrew and Arabic a language we know um call Acadian crucially for our purposes this evening however it was hinks who recognized that some of the sound values um from the uh the the the list of possible signs um were being used in these Acadian Semitic texts to write um Semitic words so for example the sound value key that sign you see circled in red was being used in the inscriptions that he was reading to write the word Esser to in Acadian a shorthand effectively why would they be doing this and it was hinks who recognized that potentially the word the sound value key actually represented another language in which key equaled Earth this would be the language that would be the focus of our interest this evening the language began to uncover was very different than Semitic Acadia and it was clear to hinks as he was among the first to identify that it had a grammar which modern philologists describe as a glutenative he was helped in this because among the thousands of cuneiform documents in the British museum were some which included Interlinear translations between Acadian and this new language but what to call this new language the man who came up with uh the uh deciding name was this man Jules opet another brilliant linguist um who in 1869 decided to call this new language that was emerging out of this wedge-shaped writing as Sumerian he did this by reading an Acadian inscription which reading translated king of Suma and akad the bilingual text showed that the the Sumerian version of this inscription read Lugal Ki engi KI URI but because Sumerian was so poorly known it was decided to stick with the Acadian name schumeri and so Sumerian became the name for this new language if there were speakers of Sumerian there must it was thought be a Sumerian people and this was based very much on an understanding in the 19th century of how the world was organized by race there was according to thinking of the time types of people who had emerged in specific regions of the world with distinct characteristics these were placed on a sliding scale from civilized to primitive with Europeans of course at the tip of the highest civilized stereotype there were therefore stereotypes of uh uh or aggressive people intelligent people um primitive people of course such thinking today comes with words and imageries that we find offensive and this whole notion is uh rejected but since the 18th century it was thought that the best way to determine racial types was by measuring skulls and this could be applied not only to the skulls themselves but to sculptures which were seen as records of perceptions and since the Greeks were both European and considered the finest artists the ultimate test was how close one's skulls came to the Apollo Belvedere in the Vatican Museum as a test to see on where you ex you sat on that sliding scale of primitive to civilized now a solution to identifying the Sumerians as a people um came with the excavations of the man seated in the photograph here uh in the middle of the photograph with his hat this Ernest De sarzak who was the French Vice Consul at Basra um in the late 19th century and he began to explore in his days off the site of Tello ancient gearsu and in 1877 having been granted permission from the local Sheikh to Begin work there began to dig into the settlement Mounds that littered the site his workmen uncovered enormous sculptures covered in Sumerian inscriptions and it was the cuneiform text covering these statues that revealed that they belonged to a ruler called gudair of the city-state of lagash but they came with a problem there were no heads to see what the Sumerians looked like they couldn't be classified racially so instructions were sent from the Louvre Museum where a new Oriental Antiquities Department had just been established to receive the statues of gudea and to pray detect at all costs find Heads This was the most important thing to understand who the Sumerians were in the late late 19th century by 1903 some heads had been discovered and a few of them actually attached to some of the bodies that had been found and so the Sumerians were defined they were according to these uh discoveries uh individuals with round skulls and clean shaven in this way according to the racial stereotyping of the time they could be distinguished from Semitic speakers in Mesopotamia who judging by the Assyrian reliefs were bearded this of course all sounds today like complete nonsense but at its time it was cutting-edge science well while the Louvre Museum was receiving the statues of gudea and was thus among the first institutions to start displaying the Sumerians to the world and it was the turn of the Americans to uh arrive in Mesopotamia in 1883 the American Oriental Society announced rather grandley England and France have done a noble work of exploration in Assyria and Babylonia it is time for America to do her part let us send out an American expedition which they duly did um but it was not until 1889 when funding had been secured by the University of Pennsylvania and the Babylonian expedition began work at the site of nipple these excavations were led by John Punnett Peters professor of Hebrew at the University Hermann Hill prep as the asuriologist the epigrapher who would be translating whatever texts were discovered and John Hayes as photographer the excavations were undertaken on an enormous scale with hundreds of local people employed to dig enormous trenches in the ground with the intention of finding objects to take back to America to rival those discovered by dasaza at Tello it was a terrible time however at nepor um the sight-faced sandstorms regularly and it wasn't helped by an acrimonious falling out between uh the uh The Americans the whole uh uh Expedition uh ended on a sour note when local tribesmen plundered the camp setting it on fire nonetheless by the end of the expedition in 1900 they had discovered not enormous sculptures but tens of thousands of cuneiform tablets and it was these that would turn out to contain some of the most important Sumerian literature ever discovered in Mesopotamia they were divided between the excavation sponsors the University of Philadelphia and so arrived in uh Pennsylvania and the ottoman Turkish authorities took a share for their New Zealand in Constantinople modern day Istanbul foreign returned to Mesopotamia in a very different fashion the first world war brought the British back to Sumer the Ottoman Empire had sided with the German and Austrian Empire and the British saw this as a threat to the Suez Canal and their oil fields in Southwest Persia and so uh forces uh moved in 1914 to Basra and then moved North to Baghdad which they entered in 1917. Mesopotamia became a mandate governed by the British but a rebellion against that occupation resulted in the British establishment of the kingdom of Iraq in 1921. and with the kingdom came the appointment of Gertrude Bell as honorary director of Antiquities in the New Kingdom she would start to write laws around Antiquities that were much more generous than the ottoman export laws and this encouraged a major excavations to begin in southern Mesopotamia okay the largest Expedition which would reveal more about the Sumerians perhaps than any other site was that undertaken jointly between the British Museum and the University of Pennsylvania Museum between 1922 and 1934 at the site of UR led by Charles Leonard Wooley normally called Leonard Woolley who is an experienced excavator the his major excavations again with hundreds of local people Dao termed Iraqis and began to discover objects similar to those known from sites like Tello Sumerian votive figures again some missing their heads but perhaps his most famous find was in 1927 with the famous Royal cemeteries these rich burials woolly dated to a time before the earliest kings of Egypt thus giving the Sumerians a perceived precedence in the history of civilization we now know of course that they date much later to around 2500 BC perhaps some 600 years later than woolly imagined the most intriguing aspect at the cemetery was the burial of a large number of sacrificial victims in the richest of these Graves woolly imagined that these individuals had taken poison perhaps willingly to lie down to follow their leaders to another world and among the richest of the tombs that survived was one which contained the body of a woman identified by an inscription on a seal beside her body um as shubad or at least that was the name read by the epigrapher at Ora who along with everybody else at the site imagined she must be Sumerian she was decked out in some of the most elaborate jewelry in the grave and her face was reconstructed by Leonard wooley's wife Catherine for exhibition her face was modeled uh as uh as my colleague Gene Evans in Chicago has brilliantly identified um as uh on matahari um no a film Idol um uh uh doing the rounds through America and Europe um so uh very much based on a European image and Shabbat was even imagined as a flapper as can be seen in the Saint Louis Post-Dispatch here from 1930. so the Sumerians were being imagined very much as as real living European American people it was thought at this time and seemed to be suggested by images such as this the famous standard of or from another of the rich Royal Graves at or and Woolly described this in uh very appealing texts that the Sumerians had arrived in Mesopotamia from outside the region they had migrated it is thought from the East their agglutinative language was imagined as having an origin somewhere in the Far East and of course racially they were being connected with Europeans they brought civilization it was thought to the Semitic populations already evident already resident in southern Mesopotamia but as the Reconstruction of the time went after many centuries of creating civilization cities writing and the wheel the Sumerians were then crushed by that Semitic population as evidence by statues such as this of an Acadian King discovered at Nineveh bearded of course then in the same reconstruction teasing out the evidence from the texts and based on racial stereotyping in the 1920s and 30s it was concluded that after this crushing of the Sumerians by an Acadian Dynasty there was a brief Renaissance in which the Sumerian people re-emerged under Kings like gudea of lagash and the rulers at Ur who constructed the famous ziggurat at uh before once again falling to Semitic speakers and this time for good so that was the narrative that was constructed in the late 19th early 20th century and it is a narrative that is still in many respects still with us it Finds Its Echoes In stories websites and uh films but what do we know about Suma and the Sumerians today what does more recent evidence suggest is the reality behind that 19th century 20th century vision well we know that we can push the story of ancient Sumer Southern Iraq much further back in time than had previously been thought the Waters of the Persian Gulf extended much further north in the 7th and sixth Millennia BC and so sites like eridu or and even Uruk were essentially Maritime worlds looking to the saltwater ocean to the South and then North into a rich World a watery world of Reed marshes and lagoons settlements were on higher Mounds Turtle backs as they're known which lifted them above the level of the flood waters or the seasonal inundations the resources were rich with reeds in and Wildlife but part date palms clearly had already been domesticated as early as 7000 BC much earlier than previously thought and this was the basis for people in the region coming together in settlements but that coming together in settlements traditionally seen as having its Origins on the southern alluvial Plains of Iraq um was a much wider development again than previous thought and our best evidence for that comes from the sight of tell Brach as we will serve me here from its current excavator um Augusta McMann in the BC lecture in January uh February rather but tell Brock reveals uh evidence um for the emergence of urban life across the region um as early as the fifth Millennia BC looking at this site in North Syria we find that between around 4 200 BC and 3800 BC there was a rapid expansion in the site so here in the slide you can see the settlement mound in the central in in Center Martin gray and then areas of dense settlement as indicated by the darker red color discovered by surface survey at the site by 3800 BC that had merged together into a large urban sprawl here at telbrack in this period they were using Technologies of administration in control including stamp seals these were impressed in clay to manage containments forms of Taxation that included images as you can see in the bottom right hand corner of the slide are including images of a man spearing a lion something an image which in later Mesopotamian history would be an image of kingship so perhaps already here reflecting hierarchies of power and authority now these developments we see happening at tellbrock in the early fourth Millennia BC take their most impressive form at a slightly later period at the site of Uruk in southern Mesopotamia Southern Iraq on the Euphrates now in the middle of desert land the city was originally fed by the Riverview freitans and it was a truly massive City perhaps the largest settlement in the world around 3400 BC with Monumental buildings at its Center as suggested by these reconstructions these buildings also contained elaborate art the famous shows A procession of uh animals and Men towards the presentation scene in the top register um at a temple there are sculptures of animals many of them superb worth works of art which were being presented to the Gods in these Temple buildings alongside elaborate images of authority such as the famous Uruk priest king because like this man are also shown on a new invention stamp seals are joined by cylinder scenes to be rolled across clay as a signature and a mark of authority by around two thousand three thousand two hundred BC the administrators of these Monumental buildings and the agricultural Estates that were providing them with the resources of the land we're beginning to record information on clay tablets the tablets big enough to fit in the palm of a hand were divided into a grid with data dropped into each of the cells numbers and the drawings of the objects being counted um creating essentially a spreadsheet they can't however be read we don't know if the administrators the scribes who are creating these administrative records and spoke Sumerian they're simply not sufficient grammatical elements in the signs to allow that to be determined though I think it is fair to be said that most Scholars think that was probably the case by around 2800 BC however the recording system that had been used for bureaucratic purposes begins to be used to express grammatical elements that are clearly Sumerian there are clearly Sumerian speaking scribes or at least Sumerian scribes or writing Sumerian and we have a few Stone monuments that record legal contracts probably for intended to be intended for deposit in a temple and here is a very good example now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art the Steely of ushumgal which shows uh our man ushangal a priest identified by the caption written on his skirt which you can see on the left of the screen standing before the entrance probably to a temple door while covering the rest of the inscription are images of witnesses and the people involved in the legal transaction text recording the detail of that transaction essentially the sale it seems of property dedications and temples also included other Stone monuments such as plaques showing Libations before the gods so we begin to get a sense of the religious world of Suma there were statues of individuals also carried into temples some of them inscribed in Sumerian giving us their names titles and the god to whom they were dedicated and more writing clay tablets that now record more than simply the movements of goods in and out of storerooms but we begin to record more detail of economic transactions as well as hymns prayers and other information around society and life in these cities of southern Mesopotamia they are written in Sumerian but there are good indications including the names of some of the scribes where are of the presence of Acadian so we are almost certainly looking at at least in some areas of southern Mesopotamia at this time at a bilingual world in which Sumerian might have been the language of writing but there were certainly Semitic languages being spoken alongside Sumerian foreign BC it is clear that some of these cities had emerged as the centers of city-states with Kings identified both in inscriptions but also through Royal imagery and here one of the earliest representations of a king or Nancy his name written using the cuneiform script before his nose where he carries a basket of soil on his head for the ritual making of the bricks to build the temple for his gods and then in the lower register or Nancy reappears raising a cup in Celebration by completing the building the plaque itself would have been nailed to the interior wall of his temple building um through the hole in the center a record of Royal success foreign we also see images from this time of other aspects of royalty including the role of the king as Warrior and one of the most famous monuments again coming from Telo discovered by the sarsak and his excavations in the 19th century is the so-called vulture Steeler of aonatum a successor to orananche whose show and the Steeler shows the king leading his troops into battle against the Rival city-state of Uma foreign is that we know from these texts that Suma southern Mesopotamia was divided into between 20 and 30 city-states just jostling for authority and access to agricultural land and the resources of water as well as of course the control of trade with resources beyond the region and that rich trade beyond the region is expressed most course remarkably in the material in the most famous series of Royal Graves that at uh we're back with Queen Shabbat according to Leonard Wooley but now our better understanding of the cuneiform script and the reading of the ancient languages it makes much more sense to read the signs you can see inscribed on the cylinder seal found beside her body not as Shabbat but actually as puapi which is Acadian for word of the father so if names are indication of social identity and referencing then turns out to be not a Sumerian Queen but an Acadian one and new thinking about the graves and the individuals who accompanied individuals like puabi into the next world woolley's reconstruction of them having taken poison to volunteer themselves into the next World um has now been challenged by the analysis of a number of skulls in Philadelphia where it is clear that at least one young woman and a young Soldier were killed by a blowed the back of the head with a sharp ax this is probably what occurred to all the individuals in the graves so we're beginning to reconstruct a very different world than the one that woolly had imagined in his excavations beginning to see a much more complex nuanced place than perhaps the simplistic racial stereotyping of the early 20th century the idea this is true the idea of the Semitic crushing of a Sumerian people because we find with the monuments of the kings of akkad who indeed did unify the city-states of Mesopotamia around 2300 BC not in the sense of racial conflict because Sumerian continues to be used in their inscriptions although in many of the royal monuments Acadian begins to be introduced as well but we need to re reject the racist Notions of single groups battling with each other and understand this is a very complex bilingual multilingual world where people's identities were shaped by their place within those societies as much as any sense of uh race that unified region established by the kings of akkad um was maintained or re-established by the rulers of UR a shift in the center of political power in the late third millennium BC and they built monuments reflecting their power and authority and one of the greatest Kings of UR at this period was a man called shulkey it was under King shogi that Ur came to dominate the region stretching from the alluvial Plains of Mesopotamia up onto the highlands of Iran and we know from recent analysis of the texts that schulgi spoke Acadian and it is certainly agreed that at this time Sumerian was if not dying as a language was already dead and yet around 2100 BC as this Kingdom of all was dominating Mesopotamia it was decided to adopt the Sumerian language as the language of the state of administration it was a dead language or a dying language but would be used much as Latin was used in medieval Europe as a language of learning and Authority so again the notion that this period saw a Renaissance of a Sumerian people has to be challenged that in fact what we're seeing is not the death of a people but the end of a language it's in the same period the so-called or three or third dynasty of or at the end of the third millennium that we find the first references to the king of Sumer and akad that phrase that allowed opart um in the 19th century to give a name to this region and the people speaking a language but it was a term that may have reflect the earlier differences between the concentration of languages with Sumerians spoken further more in the South and Acadian speaking much more in the North or as seems perhaps more likely it was a construct created by the scribes of the rulers of UR to create an idea of identity and a unified a unified world so when this document was written the Sumerian king list this uh its most famous version in now in the ashmodium museum in Oxford around 1800 BC when this was written and of course many of the famous Sumerian literary Creations um were produced at the same time no mother spoke to their child in Sumerian now it was the language of a small scribal Elite who spoke Acadian a people hadn't disappeared only the language and that language would continue to be learned by scribes for the next two thousand years not to be spoken but to be written and even as late as the 7th Century BC um Assyrian Kings like ashobanipal lost the great Assyrian monarchs learned to read and write it his scribes composed dedications and honored him with texts that parallel those known from the time of schulgi so looking back to that moment in time when Sumerian came to be in to an end as a spoken language but when it was turned into a venerable language of literature and learning but as Sumerian as cuneiform culture gave way to alphabetic Scripts the need to know Sumerian disappeared and by the first centuries of the Christian era it had been lost and so the discoveries of the 19th century uncovered that language once again but who spoke it where they spoke of it and where they wrote it is a question that still is being uncovered thank you very much indeed and Merry Christmas well that was actually wonderful um we have quite a few questions in the Q a and if anybody else has questions to add could you please put them in that way some of them might be more linguistic than Paul might like but we'll see how he does um so would you elaborate please on the early date so I make sure no I have to go back to the front there's one from Denise ilgarz firstly thank you and then my question is why the Sumerians were so important to National ideas because of the writing or just only the cost of the fines that you found uh well they they were integrated into the thinking of the time uh so late 19th early 20th century the world was constructed around this notion of race in which uh ancient peoples um were on a sliding scale between civilized and primitive um which paralleled people in the Contemporary World which were equally thought as between primitive and civilized um and so you were looking for a series of tick boxes which allowed you to place people along that sliding scale um and of course um Europeans um were seen as the most civilized um societies with the languages they spoke their physical characteristics their emotional responses to the world and so on um whereas other people in other parts of the world were characterized in different ways along that for that scale so when the Sumerians were as it were uncovered they were were placed in onto that sliding scale so the elements of them were primitive but because their language seemed to suggest that they belonged to um uh they can they were connected in this racial stereotyping to Europeans and Woolly and some accounts actually imagines that their ancestors were the Neolithic Barrow Builders of Wessex and other writers at the time talk about Sumerians with blue eyes you know this there's a real drive to find uh situate these people who are seen as the Builders of civilization in Mesopotamia as very much part of the roots of Western Civilization um of course you know a form of thinking about the world which we completely reject today but they were absolutely fundamental in thinking about how those regions that uh European powers of course were were colonizing um and occupying um could therefore be claimed now and then so the next question um which you might have already answered somewhat but um came in early for Majid al-yasiri um of the many new theories postulated about the origins of Sumerians and there are many which seems more realistic to academics currently well I I mean there was there's always there's always been the idea that the Sumerians moved as a group from outside um the region of Mesopotamia that somehow they had migrated in bringing these characteristics with them but if we if we reject those sort of racial stereotyping and realize actually the evidence we're looking at is the linguistic evidence then there's no reason to think that people speaking a a language we call Sumerian weren't present in southern Iraq um from a very early period and indeed and this has been suggested from the 1960s uh by archaeologists like uh Joe nodes for example who who um recognized that um the uh Traditions that she was uncovering in prehistoric Mesopotamia had enormous continuity into the historic period and there was no reason to imagine major breaks in which invasions of people swept um things aside or introduced anything new there was a sense of cultural development and of course the at a point in time in the late fourth millennium BC when we start to be able to read some of the the the uh get a sense of the languages being written uh spoken in the region the first one that that appears in the Texas Sumerian so again that suggests um a preeminence which may not have been a reality it just simply reflects the accident of of um the the moment of development of a system for recording a spoken language um so again I think the perhaps the latest thinking is a recognition of the complexity of the world we're operating in and that there's no reason to think in terms of simplistic movements of single groups of people um but a much more Dynamic World in which different people are are involved and contributing to change so Anthony Rivera asks um where can Sumerian Scholars and students find accessible and legible images of Sumerian texts with high resolution signs and not just transactions for example the Sumerian Kings list Etc um well there are a number of of resources available uh online um there's uh if you want to look at the actual cuneiform documents themselves and very often with transliterations so the the um the uh the transcribing of the cuneiform signs into their uh into uh Roman characters Latin characters then um you Google cdli which is the cuneiform Digital Library initiative and this is an extraordinary resource which is is photographing in extremely high resolution all the cuneiform documents in collections around the world and they've already got thousands and thousands online so that that will allow you access to the the um ancient documents themselves to see translations of many of these important inscriptions you need to look at another site with the um the acronym orac and uh oracc and there you will find a whole series of um projects and websites where you can explore different aspects of uh ancient Mesopotamia but you will find translations of Assyrian Babylonian and Sumerian texts foreign please on the early date for the domestication of the palm tree um yeah this is this is um work that um came out a couple of years ago um Mark alter wheel at uh UCL among a number of other uh archaeologists um has has published um this uh there's a there's a a nice accessible article um in uh the uh ancient near East journal and it's available online um but there's also a a more detailed article in um the journal Iraq um where um the analysis of a whole range of of uh agricultural projects has been shown to have its Origins much earlier than previously thought and they they there is there does seem to be good evidence according to to this um uh work of date palm cultivation in the area of Uruk um as early as the the late 8th early seventh Millennia BC for those who don't know the Journal of Iraq is the um Journal of the British Institute for the study of Iraq and it was originally started in the early 1930s so it's still going strong um a complicated question a bit but I'll try and hopefully you can get it all could the development of cuneiform writing on monuments or memoranda be considered as the emergence of an externalized mind calling a populist to ever more widespread and elaborate forms of organized existence in service of illiterate yet dreadfully superstitious priesthood and Elite foreign well I think I mean it's that's uh that probably deserves a lecture all on its own but uh I think um I mean I think what's interesting of course is where this cuneiform script was used and it starts um in this as these bureaucratic documents uh managing these uh these agricultural Estates and the and the resources in and out of of storerooms we then find in the early third millennium um texts which are connected to Legal contracts so if the if the evidence isn't biased by just simply what's been found there's a sense that um that writing emerges for the use of first bureaucrats and then lawyers um perhaps not too surprising um because you want you're wanting to preserve the evidence of contracts into the future and so those are put onto um on to Stone monuments and preserved in temples the the next step is then for those in authority and as we see in the midterm Millennium the um the appearance of what we can describe as kings they um they um their legal texts are effectively um their monuments set up in uh temples like the great Steely which show them triumphing over their enemies on behalf of their gods and the text recording the fact that um the the outcome of those events um so the monuments are to some extent as far as we can tell public um but um again who who exactly had access to them is unclear and having got access to them how many people could actually read them is also unclear and it may well be less about people reading The Monuments and more about a statement for eternity as a record for the future uh rather than uh monuments um that people can can inspect and read but again as I say this that opens up whole range of uh conversations which um uh could be the subject of probably several lectures so um Stephen Kangas asked what is the difference between the shade and the unshaved male figure um well that's a very good question and um you know the the Simplicity the simplistic idea of the the late 19th century that the Beards represented Semitic speakers and shaved um uh statues represented uh Sumerians because of course um we can completely reject because um there are statues uh bearded statues with Sumerian inscriptions and vice versa um it may may well be connected to um uh religious ritual activities um so you know the shave shaving um as a ritual exercise uh there may be an element of fashion certainly we see in uh figures of females uh very elaborate hairstyles um and that may be again related to specific uh moments in time or or specific institutions um so there isn't an easy answer and it's probably um no easier to answer than asking the same question for modern uh people um why I'm shaved and others not a whole range of social uh uh and uh other reasons um among choices fashion possibly is there any reason the heads were missing from sculptures or a result of that particular damage this is from Julia Ryan so again a very interesting question because of course many of these statues were discovered in the 19th century without heads but this seems to be the the loss of heads has probably happened in Antiquity um and it possibly to be tied to the fact that these statues were imagined to have uh lives of their owns they contained an essence of the individual they represented so if you made a statue or a relief of a king in a sense they they retained a presence of that individual or their office through the image and so one way of destroying that power that Authority was to decapitate the statue and we see that sort of action very clearly on the Assyrian release at Nimrod and Nineveh where many of them were defaced or mutilated when the Assyrian Empire fell because the they were believed to hold this this power within them you needed to not only destroy the actual ruler us the the living rulers but you needed to destroy the the images that were designed to maintain that power into the future so you defaced and mutilated them um quite when this happened with the statues of gudea of course we we don't know um but they were almost certainly uh they'd lost their heads probably by the time um that they seem to have been curated um under um Greek rulers in the centuries following uh the um the The Invasion and and control by Alexander the Great so um there seems to be sort of a Mesopotamian practice to to destroy the power of art effectively thank you so um Angie De Long says I'm confused I thought Acadian was used as the international language of diplomacy um well it certainly became that in the second millennium BC um so uh but of course it was a that was a living language so it was a language that um uh most famously of course in the the Amana letters and so on the this is this became the language of diplomacy but Sumerian was written by the scribes uh in the temples um as a language of literature and learning and it was a a language that evoked uh sort of a venerable past um and connections with the Divine World um so uh so you have them operating together and of course um they the uh the system of writing um allowed you to actually absolutely merge Acadian and Sumerian together and as as I suggested um as hinks uh uh identified you know that that Sumerian word key um could be used by an acadian's uh writing scribe um to to refer to Esser to um but they mean the same thing so this this really wonderfully flexible um merging of two different uh languages but um as within the scribal tradition but certainly Acadian is is um in the second Millennium um is and onwards is the the language of diplomacy so I missed some of these um first question which was what do you think about the origins of Sumerian word words erudu burenam and ingur I think um Sumerian or pre-sumerian thank you right um well I I I'm not a a specialist in the Sumerian language so I will leave this for others to debate but my understanding um is that um they they're I think it's generally accepted now that um there is no pre-sumerian language um as it were preserved or Echoes of that in in the texts that this is something of a a mirage which um emerged in the middle of the 20th century when a number of Scholars began to to reconstruct um what would describe sort of pre-tigridian or pre-eupritian languages um uh sort of predecessors to um the the Sumerians before they arrived effectively um but more recent work um um has has challenged this and um and has has a and has shown I think that these words are actually um Sumerian um or or are related to no other known languages so um there's there's no evidence for it as far as I know so there are quite a few extra questions but I'm going to actually have to skip through because I don't think we can take up the rest of your evening um but hadani did Mars did ask um to what degrees do you think the 19th century ideas and ancient races battling each other influences current Western ideas about contemporary Iraq yeah I think I think it's an important question to ask because the the notion of the Sumerians as a distinct body of people you know that are somehow separate from others um is still something that one finds in the literature and it's a you know it's a very powerful uh Vision um which comes with this idea of civilization and the origins of writing um and and I I think it it does come with the danger of thinking about people in those simplistic terms rather than thinking about the the you know the modern pluralistic um exciting world that we know places like uh modern Iraq are um so um so yeah I think it it's definitely the the Legacy even though we reject it in terms of our scientific thinking and our understanding um it it still has a presence which we should be wary of for sure so I'm only going to take three more of the remaining questions apologies to others but one is from Harriet Crawford how do we know what language was spoken by schulgi and she says some gorgeous illustrations and new facts thank you oh well um thank you um Aria to really um is the foundations for anything I know came from you so thank you very much um uh this is the uh the the work of uh uh The Scholar Rubio who has been analyzing um uh the uh the largely Sumerian texts um to to think about them in terms of the fossilization of the language and it's his uh analysis um which um pushes it towards our understanding that shogi is actually a a Acadian speaker um but I I can I will share with you the references because again not being a specialist in the ancient languages um and I couldn't go into the detail here so there are a couple of questions related to to um Gilgamesh and its Sumerian Origins but I think that might be for another lecture unless you want to say anything about it but um well very quickly I mean that um of course our earliest texts for uh Gilgamesh or Bill gamess as he's known in Sumerian um come out of the or three period so the late third millennium that time when um we see Aura dominating the region and they seem to be stories um that um are focused around the Royal Court uh and the the king's relationships to um the the ancient city of Uruk uh and uh the sense of kingship um and Gilgamesh then uh enters um the the uh sort of the the scribal uh School curriculum um and um becomes an integral part of what it is um to think about um the past in Mesopotamia so apologies to those whose questions we are not answering um a Paul might be able to glance through them later on if there's anything he feels compelled to there are two people to thank Paul obviously as our speaker and we should all thank him particularly because this is the end of his term at University and I have to say that he's an incredibly busy man and giving his time Trudy is a Christmas or festive gift to us all and behind the scenes we'd really like to also thank Ali Carter who is the person who keeps these talks going without him it would be impossible for for us to run these things um all of our talks there were some questions whether our talks are recorded this is recorded and it is on the bisi website and you look under past events and you can find the recordings of the zoom calls sorry the zoom talks but also some of our other original talks you can get audio recordings of as well um I'd like to thank you all for attending we had you know about 150 people on which is amazing and when many of you are still on which is even more amazing and thank you all and um Paul and I and everybody at busy um wishes you the best for the holidays and see you in January and February okay thank you very much
