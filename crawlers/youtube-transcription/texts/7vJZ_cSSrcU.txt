hey everyone welcome to history with psy in this episode we're going to take a look at one of the earliest wars in recorded history and a rivalry for resources that lasted for hundreds of years between the two Sumerian states of lagash and OMA [Music] so in the past I've talked a bit about how the various city-states of ancient Mesopotamia came into being they initially started out as settlements along the banks of rivers and over time and with improved irrigation and farming techniques these settlements grew from villages into towns and then into what would recognize a cities though it's pretty clear from archaeological evidence that armed conflicts between city-states occurred we generally don't have the details as to why or how a certain conflict resulted in a war one exception of this comes from inscriptions and confirm tablets found in the ancient Sumerian city of lagash this city was actually part of a kingdom that consisted of three major cities dear sue which was the capital B'gosh and nima sir Aram the patron deity of lagash was Ning gear sue a God associated with farming hunting law healing and war in the Akkadian language this God's name is known erta other powerful Sumerian city-states of the early dynastic period included or auric and oma these three states especially oma were often at odds with Lagash in fact they often allied with each other solely to isolate and battle against Lagash in many cases these conflicts had to do with farming land and access to reliable sources of water to things that were always in short supply in the deserts of Mesopotamia this doesn't mean that Sumerian city-states were always fighting cooperation with each other was just as important for their survival the most common form of cooperation between city-states was through trade for example a Sumerian king named or nan she believed to have been the founder of the first great dynasty of lagash claims repeatedly that he had ships from Dillman which is today in modern bahrain transport timber to his kingdom from various foreign lands other documents from lagash mentioned commerce with the cities of a table dare nipper or oak and also uma but let's get back to the conflict between the gosh and Vermont these two city-states were quite close to each other in terms of distance in fact the gotchas capital of gusu was only thirty kilometers from Omaha we don't know exactly when the conflict between the two started but the reason for it was due to a fertile stretch of land between them called GU Deanna according to a treaty from around 25 50 BCE Lagasse and OMA had agreed to a set border between their two territories at this border was a large steely which is generally a large slab of stone with writing or images carved onto it this Steely has actually never been found and it seems to have either been lost to the sands of time or if you believe the legation explanation for it was actually destroyed by the king of OMA we know from other documents that the original treaty was arbitrated by a king named Miss Elam who was the ruler of Kish a city-state to the north of both Lagash and OMA the treaty was pretty advanced for its day it contained a crop sharing arrangement for a portion of land that was on Lagasse's territory but that could be cultivated by OMA under a lease with annual payments in bushels of barley to cover the maintenance of costs to gudinas canals however OMA repeatedly refused to honor this agreement which led to frequent armed clashes between the two around the Year 2470 BCE Wilma was decisively defeated by King Ian autumn of lagash now before we move any further let's talk a little bit about Ian's autumn I mentioned earlier a certain aura and she the founder of lagash is first dynasty during his reign lagash was very prosperous in several of his inscriptions born and she tells of all the buildings that he commissioned as well as the extensive trade networks that Lagash was part of his son Aquagirl has been pretty much forgotten but his grandson Ian autumn is quite famous though he was a shrewd statesman he's best remembered and actually was known during his time as a great warrior and his defeat of OMA only increased his stature dude Allah gosh is great tradition of record-keeping though it may be a bit biased we have a pretty good idea of what its conflict with OMA was about and how it ended one of these is a graphic monument that was commissioned by Ian optimum that we call the steely of the vultures carved out of a single slab of limestone the steel II was erected to commemorate the anonymous victory over OMA unfortunately only fragments of the Steel II have survived but through the painstaking work of archaeologists it's been estimated that it was probably around 180 centimeters tall 130 centimeters wide and 11 centimeters thick the steely contains several panels with different scenes these pictures carved into the stone give us a glimpse at what warfare in ancient Sumer may have looked like there's another object which gives more detail about the Lagash puma conflict it's known as the enmity Nocona and it was commissioned by ian atoms nephew whose name was enmity 'no i want to actually read to you some of the translated text from the enmity 'no cone so that you can listen to Lagasse's justification for the conflict and i quote by the immutable word of Enlil king of the lands father of the gods minger su & Shara set a boundary to their lands my coelom king of Kish at the command of his deity caddy set up a steely in the plantation of that field so here the enmity 'no cone sets up a historical backdrop to the situation saying that the great god Enlil also with ming gear su the patron deity of lagash and Shara the God representing Ouma have already set up an unalterable boundary between the two states and they had chosen Missy l'm the king of Kish to be the one to carry out their will and physically demarcate this border now further on in the text we learned the cause of the war and not surprisingly it's all umas fault the text reads and I quote oh Sh ruler of Ouma formed a plan to seize it the steely of mycelium he broke in pieces into the plane of lagash he advanced later in the text we learn of how Ian's autumn resolved the conflict like in the past the conflict is resolved yet again with the treaty however this time in addition to the border being re-established with the Mesilla monument or steely had been he and not on placed a heavy barley tax on Ouma to further enforce the new treaty he made the king of Ouma swear an oath to the gods to once again not violate the sacred border and cross into territories belonging to la gosh things in the century following Ian autumns death in 2425 BCE were anything but stagnant while his nephew and tamina did fight yet again with Ouma he also seems to have concluded in alliance with lougle king she doodoo of ORAC lugal King she dude who had just United oral candor into a single Kingdom and he seems to have not wanted any conflict with Lagash thus he and n Tamina concluded a peace treaty which was a major blow to oma because with this alliance no Mahad officially lost its one staunch supporter and Ally against its greatest enemy all was well for the gosh it was prospering was powerful and had few external enemies that could challenge its dominance but then an unexpected turn of events occurred in the gosh for reasons that aren't exactly clear the priests or at least a group of them obtained political influence far beyond their religious role one of the high priests even appointed his son and then Tarzi as king it's not surprising then that with the priestly class having a monopoly on power after all they controlled all of the religious institutions as well as the monarchy and government that corruption became rampant and intarsia successor Dougal andhe who was also from the priestly class was known to be extremely corrupt during his reign more than half of all land and Lagash was under his control along with the temples and religious sanctuaries those who disagreed with Liu gelinda were dismissed from their positions heavy taxes were put on the population with people going heavily into debt things got so bad that according to some documents impoverished parents had to sell their children to help pay off their debts this along with the grossly uneven distribution of land no doubt played a large part in the overall dissatisfaction of the citizens of lagash after six years of such corruption and tyranny lugal onda was overthrown by Luke Agena a king who though not a priest believed that he was divinely appointed to clean up the mess that the ones well the kingdom of lagash had become guru cadena saw himself as a reformer and along with being a capable ruler is best known for coming up with possibly the first known code of written laws now I know that this honor usually goes to or namu or Hammurabi but that may be because we've never actually found a copy of Luke again law code however we know about it and what some of the laws were from other documents that reference it unfortunately it just wasn't enough Lagasse's weakness had also not gone unnoticed by its neighbors most notably archenemy oma to the throne of oma rose a certain lugol's legacy taking advantage of the political and economic turmoil in Lagash new gaza gaze he launched an attack on the city state and it was extremely successful he not only conquered the principal cities of lagash ninis aurora and the capital of ger su but then set them on fire massacred the population and then looted and completely destroyed the holy temple of lagash as patron deity minge r su after centuries of armed conflict from what started out as a simple land dispute the gods Agassi had definitively ended the conflict with the gosh in total victory for OMA once sumerian scribe presumably from Lagash wrote a lamentation of the destruction along with a curse upon Mughals Agassi it goes and I quote the men of uma have set fire to the temple they have carried away the silver and precious stones they have shed blood in the temple the anger of the goddess nan Chi they have carried away the silver and the precious stones the men of OMA by despoiling of lagash have committed a sin against the god Ning gear soo as for lugol's legacy of OMA may his goddess madaba make him bear his mortal sin upon his head perhaps the curse did work but it took its own sweet time after destroying and desecrating the gosh new gods Agassi went on to conquer the rest of Sumer and parts of northern Mesopotamia he moved his capital from OMA to the much grander city of Uruk and established a new dynasty there from which he claims to have ruled over the land from the Persian Gulf diagonally up to western Syria if flugel zjz actually ruled over that vast amount of territory then that's quite an accomplishment you would have thought that such a man would go down in history with fame and honour in fact you've probably been wondering why you may have never read about or even heard the name Lu Gaza Ghazi in your history class or any other casual reading that's because his short-lived Empire was incorporated into that of another one who would go down in history at least in ancient Mesopotamia as possibly the most admired and celebrated ruler of the ancient world this would be Sargon of Akkad also known as Sargon the great that's another story but just know that by the end of his life Lou gaw zjz had fallen from grace so much that after being defeated and captured by Sargon he was taken from auric to the city of Nippur and tied like a dog to that city's gates for all to see in mock with Lou Garza gazes defeat to Sargon the era we know as the early dynastic period of Sumer comes to an end and the Akkadian era of Sargon and his descendants begins and thus also ends the Greek rivalry between Lagash and Ouma thanks so much for stopping by
