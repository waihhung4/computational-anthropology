"[Music] hi everybody it's ingrid from twinkle and today we're going to be learning some facts about the shang dynasty firstly what is a dynasty a dynasty is a succession of people from the same family who rule over a kingdom or an empire the shang dynasty was one of china's first ever recorded they ruled from 1600 bc to 1046 bc this was a long time ago which means there is still a certain amount of mystery surrounding the shang dynasty however we're not completely clueless for example archaeologists have found inscriptions on tortoise shells which have shown us that they did understand astrology and mathematics and they used calendars it's known as china's bronze age because it was during the shang dynasty that we began to see art and weapons and tools that had been made from bronze for example they'd make spear tips axe heads and shields out of bronze to equip their armies for battle over the 600 years of the shang dynasty about 29 or 30 kings ruled however no women ever took the throne because the crown would always be passed down to the next male in line like a son or a nephew if there wasn't one the king was believed to have a special connection with royal dead ancestors these ancestors could contact the god shang d this made the king the closest thing there was to a god and by talking to shang d through his dead royal ancestors he made a lot of important decisions on how to rule the kingdom the currency they used back then was actually very pretty they would use cowari shells which were found in the south china sea to buy goods these weren't very heavy which made them ideal for carrying around looking at the condition of the skeletons by peasants in the shang dynasty it doesn't look like those who worked in the fields or were sent out as foot soldiers were very well looked after the condition of the bones seems to indicate that poorer people were often malnourished so what happened to the shang dynasty it's been said that the final leader of the shang dynasty was pretty cruel and he used to torture his subjects so there was a big call for him to be removed from power the shang dynasty came to an end in 1046 bc of course these facts are just the tip of the iceberg if you'd like to learn more about the shang dynasty there are loads of great resources available on the twinkle website for you to download and use so please take a look around if you're interested thank you so much for watching and have a lovely day [Music] you "
