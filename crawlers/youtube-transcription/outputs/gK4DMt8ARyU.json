"Today I am brewing the oldest beer in\u00a0the world, ancient Sumerian beer from\u00a04,000 years ago,  or at least as close\u00a0as I can get.  So thank you to Hellofresh\u00a0for sponsoring this video as I make ancient\u00a0Sumerian beer  this time on Tasting History. There's an old Sumerian proverb that says  \"He who\u00a0does not know beer does not know what is good.\"\u00a0 and to that I say darn because we don't know\u00a0beer or at least we don't know exactly what\u00a0ancient Sumerian beer was like.  It's one reason\u00a0why I've taken so long to actually make this\u00a0video because the more I learned about beer\u00a0in ancient Mesopotamia, the less I felt I knew\u00a0about beer in ancient Mesopotamia.  There are\u00a0so many unknowns about just how it was made,\u00a0what was in it, and really exactly what it\u00a0was. It's enough to make you curl up in the\u00a0fetal position in the corner,  but with a ton of\u00a0wonderful information sent to me from one of the\u00a0top scholars in the field Tate Paulette,\u00a0 and with\u00a0the knowledge that no matter what I do I'm not going to get it exactly the way that they did it\u00a0 and this should really just be for fun so\u00a0\u00a0 stop taking it so seriously, I've decided to have a\u00a0\ngo at one version of ancient Sumerian beer.\u00a0\u00a0 Now the \"recipe\" that we're using is the 4,000 year\u00a0\nold Hymn to Ninkasi the Sumerian goddess of beer\u00a0\u00a0 and it's quite long, but I'm going to read just\u00a0\nthe most important parts.  \"Ninkasi your father is\u00a0Enki, Lord Nidimmud, your mother is Ninti, the queen\u00a0of the sacred lake... it is you who handles the dough\u00a0and [?] with a big shovel, mixing, in a pit, the bappir\u00a0with sweet aromatics, ...with date honey... it is you who\u00a0bakes the bappir in the big oven. Puts in order the\u00a0\npiles of hulled grains...\u00a0\u00a0 Ninkasi, it is you who water the malt set on the ground, the noble dogs guard it\u00a0even from the potentates. It is you who soaks the\u00a0malt in a jar, the waves rise, the waves fall. It\u00a0is you who spreads the cooked mash on large reed\u00a0mats, coolness overcomes... It is you who holds with\u00a0both hands the great sweet wort, brewing it with\u00a0honey and wine... The fermenting vat, which makes\u00a0a pleasant sound you place appropriately on a\u00a0large collector vat... Ninkasi, it is you who pours\u00a0out the filtered beer of the collector vat... It is like the onrush of the Tigris and Euphrates.\"\u00a0 Beautiful... but would we call that a recipe. No I don't think so. First of all it's missing\u00a0\na lot of words and other words don't have\u00a0great translations,  and it's really not clear if the\u00a0person who wrote it actually knew anything about\u00a0the beer making process  other than maybe he saw\u00a0somebody make it once.  So it's sort of like trying\u00a0to recreate a birthday cake using the nursery\u00a0rhyme Patty Cake as a recipe. I know that you roll\u00a0it and pat it, and you mark it with a B and then\u00a0you put it in an oven for baby and me, but I feel\u00a0like there are some crucial details missing and it\u00a0makes me grateful that today's sponsor Hellofresh\u00a0does not write their recipes in poetic form. No,\u00a0the recipes from Hellofresh are well written and\u00a0very easy to follow because everything arrives to\u00a0your door pre-portioned so you can get past all of\u00a0the prep work and get right to the cooking, and\u00a0it's quick. Many of their recipes take less than\u00a030 minutes to make and you don't have to go to\u00a0the grocery store to get ingredients. It's perfect\u00a0for those busy weeknights or for me days where\u00a0\nI've been in the kitchen all day making Sumerian\u00a0beer. Hellofresh has lots of options too from\u00a0pescetarian, and vegetarian to family friendly\u00a0for those picky eaters at home  and I've enjoyed\u00a0pretty much every meal that I've got from them,\u00a0but the one that I just made is most definitely my\u00a0favorite. \u00a0\u00a0 It was a Thai coconut curry chicken anit was wonderfully creamy and I got to choose the\u00a0spice level which is not at all, and I think it's\u00a0going to be on pretty much every order that I put\u00a0\nin from now on because I thought it was absolutely\u00a0fantastic, and if you want to try this or any of\u00a0the other wonderful meals from Hellofresh\u00a0 go to hellofresh.com and use my code tastinghistory21\u00a0\nto get 21 free meals plus free shipping.\u00a0\u00a0 That's hellofresh.com with my code tasting history 21,\u00a0 and I promise with Hellofresh you will never have\u00a0to rely on archeology to know what you're supposed\u00a0to put  into a recipe which is exactly what we kind\u00a0of have to do with Sumerian beer. Scientists have\u00a0studied residues on the inside of vessels to learn\u00a0some of the ingredients used  and there are even\u00a0more clues on receipts, delivery receipts like one\u00a0that calls for 18 liters of emmer wheat,  30 liters\u00a0malted barley, 18 liters of bappir to make 45\u00a0liters of golden beer. And it makes you wonder\u00a0in 4,000 years what kind of information will be\u00a0gleaned from the great receipts of CVS. Now that\u00a0account is to make something called golden beer\u00a0and that's another issue with recreating Sumerian\u00a0beer,  there were so many types. There are at least\u00a09 types in writings from the Uruk Period and\u00a0another set are mentioned a few centuries later:\u00a0\u00a0 golden beer, dark beer, sweet dark beer, red\u00a0\nbeer, strained beer, and a few centuries on\u00a0after that  they stop referring to them so much\u00a0by how they look and more by their strength:\u00a0\u00a0 ordinary beer, good beer, and very good beer.\u00a0 Good meaning strong and archaeologists believe\u00a0that some of their beers had up to 5% alcohol\u00a0by volume whereas others had almost no alcohol,\u00a0so with all that said this is one version of\u00a0Sumerian beer and it's going to take you about\u00a0a week to make.  So on day one you take about a cup\u00a0of barley and cover it with with water, and leave\u00a0it to soak. Other grains like emmer wheat may have\u00a0been used but barley was most common. Now on day\u00a0two is when things really start to ramp up because\u00a0\nwe have two ingredients, one of which we don't\u00a0actually know what it was.  It's called bappir and\u00a0\nit is some type of bread but not likely\u00a0\u00a0 anything like bread really that we know. Some translations\u00a0\nsay that it was probably a twice baked,\u00a0very hard bread and I actually use that version\u00a0when I did a Babylonian stew about a year ago,\u00a0\u00a0 but the version for the beer is probably more like\u00a0\na sourdough and that's probably how they introduce\u00a0yeast into the beer.  There may have been other\u00a0yeasts used but this yeast would work as long as\u00a0\u00a0 you don't bake it so much that it kills all of the\u00a0\nyeast, but really just kind of let it dry out in\u00a0the summer sun.  There's actually a similar dried\u00a0yeast that has been used for thousands of years to\u00a0make alcoholic beverages in Korea so going with\u00a0that theory what you'll need is: one and a half\u00a0cups or 210 grams of barley flour, one and a\u00a0\nhalf cups or 340 grams of sour dough starter,\u00a0\u00a0 and about a half cup or 120 milliliters of water. Now\u00a0\nif you don't have any sourdough starter\u00a0\u00a0 especially that has been made with barley flour you can just\u00a0\nuse three cups of flour, one cup of water and then\u00a0about a tablespoon of yeast.  Then mix everything\u00a0together and give it a good kneading for about\u00a0five minutes and cover it and leave it to rise for\u00a0a full day.  Also on day two you are going to drain the barley that you'd soaked the night before, and\u00a0then put it into a cheesecloth.  Then you need to\u00a0suspend said cheesecloth somehow and I'd kind of\u00a0tied it onto onto a ring back here,  and you can\u00a0also just kind of put it into a jar and then have\u00a0\nsomething that is  holding it in place, holding it\u00a0up off of the bottom. You don't want it kind of\u00a0pressed against anything.  You also need it to\u00a0stay fairly moist so spritz it two or three times\u00a0a day,  and after two or three days it'll actually\u00a0begin to sprout, but we are not there yet.  First\u00a0we must attend to our \"bappir\" because on day three\u00a0you want to form it into a loaf or cakes,  and then\u00a0let it sit again.  And really you want it to dry out\u00a0and get a get a nice crust on it. If you have a\u00a0stove from 1947 that's always a little warm\u00a0\u00a0 it's actually perfect. I didn't need to bake mine at\u00a0\nall but if you don't have any of those things then\u00a0you can put it into the oven. You'll do that\u00a0on day four at 300 degrees Fahrenheit or 150\u00a0Celsius for maybe 10 minutes and I mean maybe 10\u00a0\nminutes. You really just want the outside to get\u00a0a crust, you don't want the inside to get above\u00a0\nabout 110 degrees because then it will start to\u00a0kill the yeast,  but even if you don't use the\u00a0oven to dry your bappir you will need it to\u00a0malt your barley.  So on day four set the oven to\u00a0200 degrees Fahrenheit about 93 degrees Celsius\u00a0\u00a0 and then set the barley out onto a baking sheet\u00a0\nand set it in the oven for two to three hours.\u00a0\u00a0 The grain should be nicely browned and start to have\u00a0\na wonderful nutty aroma.  Then take the barley out\u00a0of the oven and let them continue to dry. Now\u00a0at this point the Hymn to Nikasi says that you\u00a0should have a dog to guard the barley even\u00a0\nfrom potentates. Alas I have no dog and Jaime\u00a0did not seem interested in helping so I took my\u00a0chances but luckily  no potentates came to steal\u00a0my barley. Now the next day, day five, this is\u00a0\nwhere everything comes together. It's the big\u00a0show y'all.  You take your barley and you crush\u00a0it into a powder. I used a mortar and pestle,\u00a0but if you want to save yourself the trouble\u00a0 a food processor works just as well. Then pour\u00a0some water onto the crushed grain and let it soak\u00a0\nfor a couple of hours.  In the meantime break up\u00a0your bappir and let it sit to dry even more for\u00a0those couple hours. Then add the bappir to a large\u00a0jar, and pour in the barley mash along with any\u00a0\naromatics you might use. These may have actually\u00a0been part of the bappir actually like kind of baked\u00a0and dried into it, not sure. Another thing we're\u00a0not sure of is exactly what those aromatics were.\u00a0They had access to all sorts of herbs and spices,\u00a0\u00a0 juniper berry, cumin, fennel, pomegranates, but\u00a0I'm using cardamom and coriander because I like\u00a0those scents and why not.  Now they also often\u00a0added date syrup so I am adding one half cup\u00a0or 120 milliliters.  This is going to add a lot\u00a0of sugar which should help in the production of\u00a0alcohol,  even the god Enki used date syrup when\u00a0making his beer.  \"In kukuru containers which make\u00a0the beer good he mixed beer mash. By adding date\u00a0syrup to its taste, he made it strong.\"  Clearly it also helped to make it sweet which seems to be\u00a0the preferred way of drinking beer especially if\u00a0you were a deity.  \"They drank sweet wine, they\u00a0enjoyed sweet beer. When they had drunk sweet\u00a0wine and enjoyed sweet beer,  they started a quarrel\u00a0concerning the arable fields. They began a debate\u00a0in the dining hall.\"  Perhaps the first argument\u00a0fueled by too much wine and beer but not the last.\u00a0\u00a0 Now if you are worried that the yeast in your bappir is not enough or you've killed it or whatever,\u00a0\u00a0 if you're worried about yeast not working you\u00a0\ncan add some yeast at this point. They would\u00a0have possibly added things like fresh grains or\u00a0\ndates or figs or other things that would have\u00a0natural yeast on them, not sure. So if you're\u00a0worried at all go ahead and add about another\u00a0teaspoon or two of yeast  because after doing all\u00a0this work it would be real real bummer if you'd\u00a0killed all your yeast  because then when you add\u00a0a gallon or four liters of water you'll just end\u00a0up with barley water instead of beer.  But once\u00a0the water is added give it a good stir and then\u00a0cover it with a cheesecloth  and leave it somewhere\u00a0out of the sun, out of the light for two to three\u00a0days to let Ninkasi work her magic  during which\u00a0time you can make sure your subscribed to Tasting\u00a0History and I can tell you a little bit more\u00a0 about ancient Mesopotamia's love affair with beer.\u00a0\u00a0 Long before the people of Mesopotamia were drinking beer, it\u00a0\nwas the drink of their gods. In the En\u016bma Eli\u0161 or\u00a0story of creation before the fight against Tiamat,\u00a0mother of dragons and releaser of monsters,\u00a0\u00a0 those gods who backed Marduk as their champion  \"...conversed\u00a0and sat down at the feast, ate grain of the field and drank of the vine,\u00a0 let sweet beer trickle\u00a0through their straws, they felt good from drinking\u00a0the beer. They became carefree, their spirits\u00a0rose, and they ordained the destiny of Marduk\u00a0their champion.\"  So not only did they set Marduk on\u00a0the path of defeating Tiamat and thereby creating\u00a0the world as we know it  but they also dispelled\u00a0the myth that ancient beers did not have enough\u00a0alcohol to get you drunk.  A lesson well learned\u00a0by Enkidu the wild man from The Epic of Gilgamesh\u00a0\u00a0 who had never drank beer until he met some\u00a0\nshepherds. \"They placed food in front of him,\u00a0they placed beer in front of him; Enkidu knew\u00a0nothing of eating bread for food, and drinking\u00a0beer he had not been taught.\"  But they said eat the\u00a0bread, drink the beer, it's the civilized thing to\u00a0do, it is our custom  and so he ate the bread and\u00a0\"He drank the beer-  seven jugs full! And he became\u00a0expansive and started to sing! His heart grew\u00a0\nmerrry his face lit up.\"  The epic does not discuss\u00a0the subsequent hangover though there are myths\u00a0\nthat caution against drinking too much beer\u00a0\u00a0 like in the story of Inanna and Enki. Enki who happened\u00a0\nto be the father of Ninkasi our beer goddess\u00a0\u00a0 was the Sumerian god of many things including\u00a0\nmagic, craftsmanship, healing, virility, wisdom,\u00a0trickery. That last one being something that one\u00a0\nof his other daughters Inanna clearly inherited\u00a0\u00a0 because one night the two are sitting around\u00a0\nboozing having a few laughs \"So it came about that\u00a0Enki and Inanna were drinking beer together in the\u00a0abzu.. the bronze aga vessels were filled to the\u00a0brim,\u00a0 and the two of them started a competition,\u00a0\ndrinking from the bronze vessels of Urac.\"\u00a0\u00a0 What happens next we don't exactly I know because there\u00a0\nare a lot of lines missing but it seems that the\u00a0\u00a0 drinking competition did not go Enki's way and\u00a0\nhe gets rather drunk and Inanna talks him into\u00a0\u00a0 giving her all of his powers, the 'mes' or gifts\u00a0\nof civilization...  all of them.  \"I will give them to\u00a0holy Inanna, my daughter... holy Inanna received\u00a0\nheroism, power, wickedness, righteousness,\u00a0\u00a0 the plundering of cities, making lamentations\u00a0rejoicing...\" And it goes on for dozens and dozens of\u00a0lines as he gives her more and more of these gifts\u00a0of civilization.  Everything from making fire to\u00a0music, to metal work and and leather working, to\u00a0the state of movement and this state of just being\u00a0sedentary. He gives her absolutely everything and\u00a0then she takes off, and Enki starts to sober up.\u00a0\u00a0 \"As the effects of the beer cleared from father\u00a0\nEnki who had had drunk the beer... and he spoke\u00a0to Isimud the minister  'Isimud, my minister, my\u00a0sweet Name of Heaven!... where are the noble scepter,\u00a0the staff and crook, the noble dress, shepherdship,\u00a0kingship?' 'My master has given them to his daughter.'\u00a0\u00a0 We've all done things that we\u00a0\nregret when we've drunk too much but\u00a0hmmm... <_< that one takes the cake. So Enki sends his\u00a0\nminister to his daughter to get everything back,\u00a0\u00a0 it does not go well. So then he sends monsters\u00a0\nto her and she fends them off and so he says\u00a0\u00a0 okay you got him and she shares those gifts with\u00a0\nthe city of Uruk. So yay civilization!  Though I'm\u00a0guessing she did not share the moral of the story\u00a0\nthat Enki just learned which is not to drink too\u00a0much beer because  the ancient Sumerians were\u00a0big fans of beer.  Beer or ka\u0161 in the Sumerian\u00a0language appears in some of the earliest known\u00a0\nwritings in proto-cuneiform around 3000 BCE. It wasn't the tales of ancient great kings or the\u00a0philosophy of the best minds of the time that\u00a0they were writing down,  no it was receipts\u00a0for beer.  Who got beer, how much they got,\u00a0and what kind of beer it was. Beer is also the\u00a0focus of several laws in the Code of Hammurabi\u00a0specifically beer sold in taverns.  \"If a tavern\u00a0keeper should refuse to accept grain as payment\u00a0for beer but accepts only silver... \u00a0 thereby reducing\u00a0the value of beer in relation to the value of\u00a0grain, they shall charge and convict that tavern\u00a0\nkeeper and they shall cast her into the water.\"\u00a0\u00a0 Seems fair to me. This grain is legal tender you\u00a0\nHAVE TO accept it. And it wasn't just grain that\u00a0was used for payment but the beer itself.  Early\u00a0records show it being given to workers as part\u00a0of their daily wages and this beer while drunk\u00a0at work was probably on the weaker end of the\u00a0alcoholic spectrum,  but there were stronger beers\u00a0that were drunk during social occasions.  It was drunk at feasts communally out of large pots\u00a0\nthrough long reed straws, often to the point of\u00a0\u00a0drunkenness, so you bet it was strong, and I bet\u00a0it was also strong beer that is depicted in some\u00a0of the art at the time,  and it's a rather erotic\u00a0form of art.  Now this art depicts beer being drunk\u00a0probably in a tavern where prostitution was quite\u00a0common, but beer was also drunk at home. In fact\u00a0it was even brewed at home. Part of a woman's\u00a0dowry was often some of the best brewing vessels\u00a0that they could provide.  And some of these vessels\u00a0are subjects of a 4,000 year old drinking song. \"The gakkul vat, the gakkul vat. The gakkul vat, the lam-s\u00e1-re vat, The gakkul vat, which makes the liver happy, the lam-s\u00e1re vat, which rejoices the heart The ugur-bal vat, a fitting in the house, the sa-gub jar, which is filled with beer,  The am-am jar, which carries the beer of the lam-s\u00e1-re vat... The beautiful vessels are ready on\u00a0(their) pot stands.\" Well now that's going to be\u00a0stuck in my head all day. I really do wish though\u00a0 that I could hear what it actually sounded\u00a0like because I am going to guess that is ever\u00a0\nso slightly different than than my performance,\u00a0\u00a0 but that's okay. The song anyway goes on for\u00a0\na few more verses and finishes up with a true\u00a0ode, a true dedication of this person's love of\u00a0beer.  \"As I spin around the lake of beer, while\u00a0feeling wonderful feeling wonderful while drinking\u00a0beer in a blissful mood,  while drinking liquor and\u00a0feeling exhilarated, with joy in the heart and a\u00a0\ncontented liver- my heart is a heart filled with\u00a0joy!\"  And I think I'm ready to fill my heart with\u00a0joy and content MY liver as I drink some Sumerian\u00a0beer. So after a couple days your brew should be\u00a0ready to pour out. The thing is we know that they\u00a0often filtered their beer  but exactly how they did\u00a0it, not quite sure. To what degree it was filtered,\u00a0not quite sure.  Some of the the vats had\u00a0\na hole in the bottom. We've actually found-\u00a0\u00a0 \"we\" archaeologists have found strainers though\u00a0\nthe holes are more like the size of a colander,\u00a0\u00a0 it's really unclear. I'm going to filter it\u00a0\nthrough just a regular strainer to get out the\u00a0big chunks,  but it's still going to be somewhat\u00a0cloudy.  And here we are ancient Sumerian beer\u00a04,000 years in the making.  So I can see why they\u00a0used a straw because there are some particulates\u00a0on the top, there are some particulates on\u00a0the bottom, definitely more on the bottom,\u00a0\u00a0 so a straw is going to help you get\u00a0\nto to the good stuff. Here we go. *sips It's interesting. The reason I kind of held\u00a0it was because there were some bubbles. It's\u00a0not- it's not carbonated. It's\u00a0ever so slightly effervescent. That's actually- it's actually not bad.\u00a0\nThere's a there's definitely a nuttiness.\u00a0\u00a0 I'm getting like a little bit of the cardamom.\u00a0\nI'm getting some of those aromatics.  What I'm\u00a0not getting a lot of is the the date\u00a0\nsyrup. I wouldn't say this is sweet. I think that they probably added date syrup\u00a0\nmore after afterward just to flavor it,\u00a0\u00a0 or there was just a lot more in there, I don't\u00a0\nknow because it's not that sweet. There's like a\u00a0hint of sweetness  but it's not that sweet. it's\u00a0also not sour. I was worried it would be sour,\u00a0\u00a0 I know a lot of people who have made\u00a0\nit and they said it is very sour.\u00a0\u00a0 It's no more sour than a modern like Hefeweizen\u00a0\nis sour which I think is a little sour,  but it's\u00a0not like unpleasantly sour. What you're getting\u00a0\nthough is this nuttiness. It's like-  it's like\u00a0the nuttiness that you get in a brown ale but much\u00a0\nmuch lighter.  I mean you can you can tell there is\u00a0alcohol in this but it's not overwhelming\u00a0at all. I mean we're gonna try some more. Yeah there's a little yeastiness so maybe it\u00a0\ncould even use a little bit longer fermenting but\u00a0\u00a0 I think it's pretty much there and we don't\u00a0\nknow when they would have stopped it honestly.\u00a0\u00a0 yeah that's kind of fun. I don't mind that.\u00a0 The thing is it doesn't last very long,\u00a0\u00a0 two days, maybe three but I'd say two days and\u00a0\nand you really kind of gotta chuck it. So\u00a0\u00a0 drink up and hopefully you know, use some caution\u00a0\nand don't give away the keys to civilization or\u00a0whatever Enki did. You know drink responsibly. So\u00a0I'm going to put a link to a playlist down here of\u00a0\u00a0 more Babylonian recipes and recipes kind of from\u00a0\nthat part of the world.  Make sure to subscribe to\u00a0Tasting History, have a wonderful new year and\u00a0I will see you next time on Tasting History.\u00a0\u00a0 I'm actually going to drink more of this. Not\u00a0\nthe whole thing, that's ridiculous, but more. [Slurp] "
