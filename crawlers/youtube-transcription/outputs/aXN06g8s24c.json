"greetings everyone around the world in 50 countries Lao Montgomery here once again with another China History Podcast episode we're going to explore the Shang Dynasty today if the Sha Dynasty which we discussed in the last podcast was a legendary Dynasty then we could call the Shang a semi- legendary Dynasty the Sha and Shang have a lot in common they both have legendary Beginnings that start with a virtuous and great leader who is beloved by the people then you have the succession and then a lot of blank spots then in the end you had a wicked Tyrant who was hated by the people and ultimately overthrown the Sha had Emperor jet the Shang had diin who went down in history as join I'm jumping way ahead but just trying to show you how both dynasties had similar Rises and Falls unlike the Sha which made a slow and steady March downhill the Shang had a great Revival 2third of the way into the dynastic period and it's really the last couple centuries of the Shang that's particularly interesting the Shang definitely has a lot more to hang on to than the Sha even to this day the great historiographers archaeologists and scientists China has to offer are still analyzing the Treasure Trove of Shang artifacts that continue to be Unearthed even to this day already 11 palaces have been discovered in and around anang in Khan Province believe it or not it was only in the 20th century that we learn this dynasty actually existed sain writes all about the Shang in his sh or records of the grand historian so it's not like we never heard of the Shang before in his great work suan enumerated all the Shang Kings more about this later I don't want to jump too far ahead I'm just trying to wet your appetite a little like the preceding sha Dynasty the start and finish dates of the Shang are open to debate in 1996 the China government launched the Shia Shang Jo D Chang or a chronology report on the xia Shang Joo to set down a more accurate timestamping for these first three Bronze Age dynasties in November 2000 the results were announced and they pegged the Sha at 270 BC to 1600 BC and the Shan was split up from 1,600 to 1300 BC for the early Shang and 1300 to to 1046 BC for the late Shang the Joe which we will discuss next in another podcast ran from 1046 to 771 BC the Shang ran during the middle of China's Bronze Age in other far away lands at this time Egypt is already a mighty Empire it was the period of the great 18th Dynasty the most famous and ancient Egyptian history it was the time of many of the most famous pharaohs like tutan kmen the tutmosis hatchepsut aadan and Nefertiti the New Kingdom in Egypt was just starting the Shang period in China was also concurrent with the time when Moses of the Old Testament Fame was born in Egypt in 1612 BC this means it was also the time of rames the 1 and second this was just as the Shia was dying out and the Shang was starting to rise elsewhere in the world the temple at Deli was built in Greece my and Menan culture was going on 1149 BC would have been the time of the Trojan War so as Chinese civilization was just starting to take shape and organize and consolidate all these other civilizations were thriving and developing on separate continents all independent of each other even in China there were more civilizations going on than simply the Shang but it was only the Shang Dynasty civilization that left behind written records of their existence in 1987 there was an exciting archaeological Discovery in suan near Chu the place was called Sing or three stars Mound lots of artifacts Left Behind like beautiful Jades and bronzes attesting to a rather Advanced people but one thing they didn't leave behind was any written record of their time unlike the Shang peoples developing up around Kanan ho Shandong and Northern an this civilization down in the ch du region had not yet developed writing so let's go with 1600 BC as the start of the dynasty like the Sha Dynasty founder y the great the Shang also had another heroic founder he came to be known as CH Tang he was named Zulu his ancestor Chi had helped Yu the great tame the yellow river floods way back when and his family was given the land of sh as a reward now the time of CH Tong was already 14 Generations later and by this time the Shang was already a rather powerful state in its own right as I mentioned in the last podcast CH Tang defeated the wicked and evil emperor Jia at the Battle of Mingo Chang founded the Dynasty and drought strikes immediately after about seven years of suffering this drought King Tong went before heaven and prostrated himself on the altar presumably at some high Temple and reproached himself before heaven and offered to present himself as a sacrifice to shangi if he would only bring rain to the drought stricken land well as the legend goes it started to rain soon thereafter and the farmers rejoiced and Chong Tong's reputation and esteem as a ruler and a hero skyrocketed so you the great who founded the xia dynasty he tamed the floods Chong Tong who founded the Shang he was able to get the Heavens to rain down upon the land water is life the capital of the new Shang government was in jungo near the present day capital of Kanan Province the capital of the Shang Dynasty moved around a lot if you form a triangle between the three cities of Jango anang and loang that covers the areas where most of the Shang palaces and major cities have been excavated it was after the seventh and final move of the capital to a place called yin where the Shang Dynasty reached its apex at the capital of Yin 12 Kings ruled over 255 years until the Shang period came to an end and the Joe took over as I said the Shang worshiped the god Shang D in Mandarin the word for God is Shang D Shang means above d means Emperor so this deity was above the emperor and the emperor through his special relationship with all the ancestors held particular closeness with shangi however Shang D the Shang Supreme deity was the main God among several the Shang religion was not monotheistic by any stretch of the imagination they were very big on sacrificing animals and they were strong followers of ancestral worship and revered their ancestors the Shang people believed in an afterlife and took tomb building and burial and General very seriously before we go through various vignettes through this dynastic period let's zero in on the four contributions to Chinese civilization that we can say came from the Shang period these are the aspects of the Shang that really Define the Dynasty and what we most remember them for first and foremost writing is seen for the first time in Chinese history more about this later the second was the social organization of the country into a very stratify IED system where everyone had a place and The Aristocrats and royal family stood at the Apex of Shang Society all these nobles were beholden to the king and they control the outlying areas too far from the capital and the King's everyday control the priests had a dual role in Shang Society not only were they entrusted with the job of Performing old rituals and religious matters they were also the bureaucrats of the kingdom and handled all the day-to-day Affairs of the government the third aspect that we can defines the Shang as their Mastery of bronze casting and their bronze making technological standard a lot survives to this day and it's beautiful the fourth and last thing special about the Shang were their use of bronze and their effective Weaponry this included everything from spares to chariots in those days bronze meant power wealth luxury it was only for those who lived at the Imperial Court or the aristocrats who had Bronze in their daily life br bronze wasn't anything that the peasants possessed or came in contact with all these bronze objects were basically either one of two things bronze was used to make weapons or ceremonial vessels never for common tools I'm sure everyone knows this but just in case bronze is a metal alloy made up mostly of copper with tin you can't imagine how much of this stuff has been dug up over the last century in the final years of the Shang especially during the yin Shang period important events records were inscribed or cast in bronze ceremonial objects the Shang people because of their Superior bronze making technology were able to make more effective weapons like Spears compound bows and better horsedrawn chariots this made them the conquerors to beat of their time San wrote in the sh G that there were a total of 30 sh rulers covering roughly 600 years Court officials belong to a hereditary class of aristocrats the core of the dynasty was located in the northern part of Konan the crops of those days were Millet wheat and barley remember the rice growing region of China is in the South these ancient dynasties were all developing in the North in China even still today wheat is eaten in the north it's rice in the south I mean everybody eats everything but as a general rule you'll see more people eating Breads and noodles in the north than in the South the Shang use the lunar calendar or yearly to date all the events of their time believe it or not this same lunar calendar was used in China all the way up to the last century they also developed a 12-month calendar with 365 and A4 days all around the world the great civilizations developing pretty much all figured that one out can you imagine though being the first person four five maybe 6,000 years ago actually keeping track d to day over a period of 365 days four years and being the first to understand the concept of a single year in a leap year in addition to this the Shang also developed the decimal system and had already begun to develop sophistication with math and science well let's get right into the whole bangers and mash here as far as the Shang is concerned if you could say anything about the ancient Chinese who developed during the Shang period these were the people who gave us Chinese characters the legend has it that Hans or Jong AKA Chinese characters were invented during the time of the yellow Emperor around 2650 BC by one of his officials tangia Tangier had four eyes he's the legendary creator of Chinese writing tangia didn't leave any evidence of his existence the Chinese of the Shang Dynasty they did but the story behind writing really begins in the last year of the 19th century in 1899 in and around the city of anang in Hunan Province all these so-called longu started showing up long means Dragon Goo Means bone these dragon bones were being dug up all over anang and the environs around the Juan River some ended up in the hands of private Chinese antique collectors who were fascinated with the archaic looking characters carved into the bone some of the bones ended up with practitioners of Chinese medicine who ground these bones up into powders used to cure a variety of ailments among these ailments was malaria and so it was in 1899 that the director of the Imperial College Dr Wang Yong seeking relief from malaria was given some of these dragon bones to grind up and consume now Dr Wong's trained eye noticed all these inscriptions on these dragon bones now up until this moment in our recent history the Shang Dynasty was about as legendary as the Shia there were a lot of stories and legends and of course we had s Chen's account of that period a lot of smoke but no fire well Dr wangong was able to trace these dragon bones to a village called Shaun outside the city of anang by 1917 Mr Wang gue had deciphered the bone inscriptions of the names of the Shang Kings and if only suen had lived to see this day because when the inscriptions were figured out and they placed the results side by side with what s chin had written in his sh G 19th centuries earlier they matched perfectly so samen wasn't blowing any smoke well once these discoveries were made and the archaeologists figured roughly where the Shan kingdom was situated they started pulling Treasures out of the ground like you can't believe tomb after tomb bronze Masterpiece after bronze Masterpiece and hundreds of thousands of shells and Bones all inscribed with ancient Chinese characters and it was through Decades of studying that the whole story of the Shang and of Shang Society slowly revealed itself from this time onward the Shang was no longer a legendary Dynasty from 1928 until the Japanese invaded China in 1937 they started Excavating yinu this is where they discovered the Royal Palace Royal tombs and a veritable Treasure Trove of these dragon bones that were soon thereafter called Oracle bones this script is called the jaku went Oracle bones made predictions about the future for the most part these were the scapula or shoulder blades of water buffalo or some kind of cattle the second most prevalent method was using the shells of tortoises using these early characters questions were carved into the bones of the shells on the opposite side a number of small pits were carved and into these little crevices or pits that they carved they inserted these thin hot metal rods this would in turn cause the bones or shells to crack then the priests would interpret or Divine these cracks and thus the question was answered then the answer to the question was carved into the same bone or the shell and taking it one step further the ual outcome would also be carved by one scribe or another and it was through studying these artifacts and there were a couple hundred thousand to study that the scientific Community there had been able to piece together the story of the Shang one after another names of Kings were confirmed style of government was revealed battles military history as well as religious beliefs slowly were discovered in time a fairly good understanding of shang's society was learned and it was also from these bones that it was learned that the Shang were constantly at war with Outsiders from near and far you see eight or nine Generations after CH Tang founded the dynasty the Shang had deteriorated into a never-ending battle between brothers and other relatives always fighting for power at the top resources were wasted building palaces and pleasure domes where Nobles lived in splendor and luxury it was only when pangang comes to the throne that the Shang revives and then reaches its climax under Wu pangang who ruled from 1290 to 1263 BC was the ruler who ripped the whole Capital up by its roots and moved it to Yin it wasn't a terribly popular move and no one common people included wanted to leave their comfortable surroundings and start all over somewhere else nonetheless that's what ended up happening and panang is credited as the founder of the yin Dynasty or Yin Shang period and for re suring the sinking ship that the Shang had become now I mentioned yinu a little bit ago the last part of the Shang Dynasty as I mention was where the dynasty reached its height of power and sophistication the capital was located in the city of Yin in Northern Hunan close to the borders of shanii and hub Shu means ruins so yinu simply means the ruins of Yin from this point on the Dynasty is called the yin Shang or sometimes just the yin Dynasty from Yin 12 Kings ruled for another 255 years all of these artifacts being pulled from the ground came from the yin period we're somewhere near the beginning of the 14th century BC now the Shang is in its golden age one of the best preserved sites at yinu is the tomb of fuha or lady H lady H was the wife of King Wu where the Gin Shang reached its greatest Heights lady h was not only wife of the king she was a great military leader in her own right and led successful campaigns against some of the shang's enemies her tomb was discovered in the tumultuous year in China of 1976 1976 will always go down in China as a banner year first of all Premier Joan Li died then Juda one of the great military Heroes and founding fathers Jew's death was followed in the same month by the massive 232 7.8 on the RoR scale Tang Shan earthquake that killed over a quar million inhabitants then chairman ma died and the whole power grab then ensued amidst all this in the winter of 1976 the fua MU was discovered mu means tomb in this case so the fua tomb was discovered now like King Tut in Egypt Fu House's tomb had been discovered undisturbed so for almost 28 centuries the tomb's hidden location had eluded grave robbers it was open to the public as an exhibit in 1999 at the yinu Museum in anang it's definitely on my list of places to go the great Bronze Age Queen fal's tomb had been dated to about 1,200 BC and it was positively identified as fal's tomb by all the bronze inscriptions or ginin as all these bronze inscriptions were called buried with this great Queen and military leader were all kinds of Jade and carved bone objects things like Arro heads hair pins and other ornamental objects there was a massive cache of bronze artifacts like weapons Bells knives mirrors statues of animals real and mythical they also uncovered Stone objects art made from Ivory and even 6,900 pieces of the coin of the realm at the time cowry shells found in the burial chamber of Queen fuha were the skeletal remains of six dogs and 16 humans presum presumably slaves it was already known at the time however that the Shang period saw a degree of human sacrifices the Oracle bones uncovered at the site revealed that fuha was the greatest military leader of her time as I said she was the wife of the 21st Shang Emperor wuin he led the yin Shang Dynasty at its peak and as I said the yin period of the Shang was the high point of the entire Shang Dynasty before we finish up the Shang and the evil and wicked Last Emperor let's look at Shang writing Chinese characters first appear during this dynasty in both Oracle bones and in these bronze ritual vessels if anything was committed to paper or some other organic substrate they've long disappeared there's been anywhere from 3,000 to 5,000 characters that have been cataloged from all the findings by archaeologists having this ability to communicate and record information and writing gave the Shang rulers a very enhanced ability to rule it really allowed the central authority to spread his wings out a little wider and directly control farther areas of the Kingdom anyways the amazing thing about this early Shang writing is that written Chinese today basically uses the same system that came up with over 2,000 years ago the system of writing that uses a radical to give the character a general meaning or classification joined together with a gentic symbol of some sort to indicate a sound is still used today and the amazing thing about Chinese characters ancient and modern is that they're they're similar to Arabic numerals and that no matter how you pronounce them the meaning is always the same so Chinese writing first starts appearing between 1500 to 1200 BC writing was already in use for about a, years in the Indus River Valley Civilization and for almost a thousand years before that by the Egyptians it was the Mesopotamian civilizations that were the earliest writing appeared in ancient Sumer as early is 3200 BC a good 2,000 years before the Shang Oracle bones as I mentioned the Shang wasn't the only civilization thriving in China proper I mention saning in sutron is a good example but only the Shang left this Cornucopia of written records of their existence and of their very structured and strictly layered Society well all good things have to come to an end and indeed it came to a smashing and violent conclusion for the Shan like the Sha before them this dynasty also suffered from a tyrant who was Remembered in infamy the Shia had Emperor J the Shang they had Emperor Joe bornin other than being credited as the creator of Chopsticks this emperor Joe Shin went down in history as the worst king of all time it's said that his name Joe that's fourth toone was a pejorative name given to him to show disrespect the Joe was part of a saddle that was near the horse's rump or Underside and its main role was to keep the saddle from sliding forward anyways its strategic location right under or near the horse's poop shoot made it the likeliest part of the saddle to become soil so you can imagine how much they like this guy if they gave him a name like that but like Caligula who was to follow him almost 100 centuries later ding started off good he supposedly had this amazing strength and was just a mountain of a man capable of all kinds of amazing feats it seen behind every tyrannical ruler there was always some Evil Woman Behind the Scenes egging am on to do the most outrageous things and and this last Shang Emperor was no exception in his case it was the evil Dai whose greatest pleasure was to watch the painful suffering of others now dein or joen uh either way he did a lot of outrageous things on his own and at the behest of his sadistic wife there was a book written during the Ming Dynasty one of the later dynasties in China that Chronicles the period of the fall of the Shang the book goes into all kinds of detail about Jo Shin's exploits it's called the fun Yi the creation of the Gods let's see here had this uh large pit dug where he had all these poisonous snakes all writhing together at the bottom and this is where he would cast any concubines that failed to humor him or got him angry he also did the uh sha King J thing and constructed a lake filled with alcohol yep King Joe made this uh called it a joer rolin which translates to alcohol pool and meat Forest yeah in the middle of this man-made lake they created an island where they had uh these trees with branches that were made from shish kebab skewers uh from which Meats were hung for those participating in the orgy or whatever it was that was going on but the topper of all Toppers the one that every Source I read mentioned was the or the cannon burning punishment now this grizzly punishment was attributed to the wicked queeni and you had this long bronze cylinder like a cannon and it was placed into a pit of white hot burning charcoal and through the magic of physics and thermodynamics the cannon itself would turn equally hot now whoever it was that was being punished or was being utilized as the source of amusement was made to walk barefoot on this cannon which of course was burning hot and to really make it particularly amusing to the Queen the cannon would be coated with a slippery oil which made it even more impossible to stand on and yeah ultimately everyone ended up falling into the charcoal pit where they were consumed quickly and painfully so all these Antics coupled with his ruthless and autocratic ways simply turned his own people against him the Mandate of Heaven was not with them and it came to pass in early 10:45 BC that King woo of Joe put an end to Emperor Joe notice that's Emperor Joe fourth Town who was defeated by King wo of Joe that's Joe first town that's the Joe state two different characters two different towns and at the Battle of muya the last Shang Emperor went down in defeat and it's from this date that we have the start of the Joe Dynasty the last of China's Bronze Age dynasties now before the evil emperor Joe went down for the count uh revolts against the excesses of the king had broken out all over the Shang Empire now the head of the Joe kingdom was J Chang better known as king Wen of Joe Joe Wen Wang he had made the right alliances and had made the Joe kingdom the strongest Contender among all these various smaller kingdoms his son was named JEA or better known as king wo Joe Wu Wang who I just spoke about who ultimately brought the Shang y down one uh last little tidbit for you regarding G Chong word had been passed through various sources to the evil emperor join about ji Chang and how he was so widely respected by the people and how various tribes loyal to the Shang were now doing it about face and declaring loyalty to chi chang join summons him to the capital at Yin or present day anang and G Chang dutifully goes to join who immediately throws him in prison where as The Story Goes G Chang wrote the eing or the book of changes that confucious called the most important of all the classics it was The Ultimate Guide for divination chi chang after seven years of imprisonment by join was ultimately set free after the emperor was given a multitude of bribes and gifts and lots of gorgeous women and all kinds of delights so G Chong is set free and at once begins organizing all the various tribes and peoples and they pour out of the wayy River Valley from the west and swept into the Shang territory and this all culminates as I said at the Battle of Muer and joen seeing he was finished supposedly committed suicide and his evil queen DOI she got beheaded we'll get more into King Wen and wo and the Duke of Joe or Joe gong in the next podcast when we look at the Joe Dynasty again another Dynasty famous for its beautiful bronzes stting starting from the Joe Chinese culture really begins to get refined and the stage is being set for the introduction of all the great Chinese philosophers we've knocked off the Sha and the Shang and we have the Joe next then we'll sort of combine the Waring States and spring and Autumn periods into one single podcast and then maybe we'll stop and do a quick overview of maybe seven of the great Chinese philosophers of the time La confucious M shangyang KH and then we have the Chin Dynasty and the first emperor of a unified China chin Wang who was our featured subject for the first China History Podcast maybe I'll re-upload that podcast for anyone who has come late to the party and didn't get to download that one I'm not sure what I did wrong but iTunes only keeps the 10 most recent shows so after I upload this one on the Shang the shows covering chin Sher hang the four Great Inventions the Great Leap Forward and the intro to five generations of Chinese leadership won't be available except for my archive on my website at China history podcast.com so anything you want to download that you can't get on iTunes you go to my archive at the uh website which again chinis podcast.com so I might re-upload that uh chiner hang episode to keep the continuity of this dynastic overview then it's upwards and onwards to the Hun Dynasty as we make our March towards 1911 and so once again this is llo Montgomery wishing everybody a fond and appreciative farewell from the City of Claremont California home of the illustrious China project at the center for process studies located at the prestigious Claremont School of Theology join us each week at the China History podcast for another tasty dim suum from the vast and Sumptuous Buffet of Chinese history "
