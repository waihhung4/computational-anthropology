"[Music] when you go to China almost the first thing you notice after the friendliness of the people is the right here they don't have an alphabet like us every word has its own picture the earliest writing comes from three-and-a-half thousand years ago when China was ruled by the Shang Dynasty and I'm in the town of shang-chi which is named after those kings over a hundred years ago the remains of palaces of the Shang were discovered in a place called annyeong and these archaeologists were very excited to find thousands of cow bones and turtle shells covered with writing they called them oracle bones and even more exciting they could still read some of them and that's because some Chinese writing signs haven't changed very much [Music] let's take the sign for a very important thing for the Shang and for us rain that's the character for Ren I mean in modern language and in all the bones is like lease with three jobs so essentially it's the same idea fundamentally and same for the character of satsang that's the character for a song in modern language and any gnorga bones is essentially the same a circle with one dog a metre so it's the steerer same idea fundamentally so the Chinese writing invented by the shown wasn't an alphabet like our writing it was pictographic that means their signs show the things they're meant to be it's a series of pictures put them together and you can start to tell a story like this once upon a time a man went into a forest looking for wood with his blade he cut down trees he trimmed off the small branches and he built himself a boat it was a good sturdy boat so he took it out to sea and then he got out his net to catch fish for his children's supper it cast his net several times and finally he caught one but then the weather began to change a big cloud covered the Sun and the man began to worry and then the weather got worse and it started to pour with rain but luckily the man had brought his umbrella the sea got very rough but you'll be glad to know that he got home to his family and they all had fish for their supper so let's look at the Shang signs and words that we've learnt Sun water mountain person tree blade boat net cloud rain and umbrella so now you can read a bit of Shang how good is that "
