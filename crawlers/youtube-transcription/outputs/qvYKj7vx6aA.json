"[Music] hey fellas and welcome back so the topic of today is Apple civilization they all quite close to my heart and I was looking forward to talk about all the bright ones in the audience already know what I'm talking about as I know they already read the title that is right we're talking about the vanetti now the vanetti where are indo-european people group located in modern-day in Veneto region of Italy but also some parts of East Friuli and Slovenia it is quite hard to explain in short what stood out about the ancient venetian civilization because there is a lot to mention it is generally agreed that they were indo-european due to their religious practices which we will talk about later but they also seem to have assimilated many cultural traits with other people around him like celts illyrians italians and even greeks even back then not many writers seem to agree on their origins this mystery plagues us to this day however the banana took this to their advantage their geographical position gave them many diplomatic lines and resources we still used well becoming great merchants specifically horse traders and amber traders Venetian orchards were a very fast breed and they played a huge role in religious and cultural practices amber on the other hand was not a local product she used to get it from other tribes up north and then they would trade it away to other military organizations particularly the Greeks before we move on let's talk about Venetian religion usually this isn't something I cover in this channel but I feel like it's necessary to get some sort of idea were they originated from one characteristic of every indo-european civilization is that they give some divine meaning to fire it was believed that by burning something you give it to the gods attributing fire as a portal to the afterlife in fact remains were burned as well as sacrifices we know many talent civilization did this as well as many others we mean we maybe knew about already but never associated with one another like the Vikings and the King Greeks horses were also very important components of Venetian religion in fact many sculptures or mortises were found in ruins of temples and homes however the most important figure in the religion and culture was probably Rachel the godmother of them nati she was also the goddess of writing in fact the priestess used to teach people to write for free before socialism was a thing some artifacts of Rachel with scriptures from the Venetian language were found in Pannonia in modern-day Hungary so people assume that the definitions were illyrians for many years which as we know it's not true as I mentioned before writers from every time period including our own can seem to agree where the heck the Venetians originally came from from Illyria Poland turkey we really don't know and the fact that there are many other civilizations with very similar names as the banana doesn't really help either most modern evidence of Reber seems to point out our Italian origins that only ink that can only be explained with the diplomatic interactions with Rome itself rambha divinity have always been allies ever since the great Celtic migration to Italy in 400 BC than we talked about last time there were also one of the only civilization that was assimilated into the Roman Empire instead of being conquered which is very rare at this the van I decided would roam in nearly every single war from the Punic Wars to wherever and they always been inseparable they were incorporated into Roman politics from 200 BC until the 50s BC the political system was not too innovative they might have had a united government with for all we know they might have been independent cities all around the Adige river but all of this I said about the banany matters matters very little compared to what I'm about to say now because the Maneri invented something something we all learn to love they use every day and while most of us often forget how much we depend on them they are nevertheless the most important invention the vanity I've ever come up with pockets the first buckets appeared in fifth in the fifth century BC in Veneto and they were called see to us now before the God eliminations invented see to us people drank wine from these like what the [\u00a0__\u00a0] is that and I'm fora how am I supposed to drink from that look at it it's pretty and elegant and gay gay now buckets are the stuff look at those sexy lines as you can imagine the world went crazy for these things and if you don't believe me then tell me what does it say on the KFC menu chicken family bucket or chicken family amphora exactly you know it but all jokes aside guys today is one year since I started making these kinds of videos and I must say my style changed a lot also we have recently reached 50 subscribers so expect a special video from me soon again I'm a puny so I have no idea when I will make a new video but I can tell you
