"okay so uh it's 12 o00 eyes me asses down lots to cover we do in fact have a lot to go over today I've been trying lately to keep my videos you know kind of in the neighborhood of 10 maybe 15 minutes but we might even have to go longer today so let's get cracking this is office hours with the professor the show where I say things today we're going to talk about China's first dynasty known as the Shia [Music] Dynasty so last time we talked about the Chinese flood myth and how it symbolizes the historical consciousness shift from the the hunting and Gathering kind of a big man society or maybe a Horticultural big man Society of the past to the Intensive agricultural stratified Society of the present day and according to the story sorry according to the story uh there's this terrible flood right that spread over the earth and the previous Society was utterly destroyed now that's where one of my historical Chinese Bros comes in and if you're a you're a faithful viewer of course you you already know about this guy my man D [Music] you D you you know who that's how we do yeah so D you all right or or in Chinese or in English sorry you the great all right so I talk about him in another video and you should check it out if you haven't because D you Kick's ass he's awesome uh here's the short version okay having worked tirelessly under the former ruler to stem this ceaseless flow of flood waters that's just covering the land he was chosen as the heir to the throne okay so he he assumed the throne in non-hereditary succession however having assumed power uh he passed his throne along to his son thus establishing a Dynasty now as King die you kept at his work until at last all of the flood waters were tamed okay and it was remembered Through the Ages for his diligence and his dedication such that he was later described by confucious as this perfect enlightened Sage King okay and as I say he founded an actual hereditary Dynasty that is the Sha okay so that said however Dau is very much a mythical figure all right I doubt very much that there was actually a guy named you who uh was in charge of of stopping the floods all right I I I highly doubt that he's very much a mythical figure rather than a historical one for one thing he lived hundreds of years before history as defined by modern scholarship that is contemporary written documentation emerged in China okay so d who lived about 4 4,000 years ago or 4 all right and uh even then uh written history did not emerge until the 13th century BC in China okay so it's highly unlikely that duu was a hisor hisorical figure okay probably mythological and even then especially given that the very earliest 13th century BC written documents contain no mention either of dahu or of the Shia Dynasty or even of the flood myth okay and that's a big hole that's missing from the the that's a big pothole in the road of Chinese history right now okay in fact we don't even hear about duu or the the the the Shia or the flood at all until a thousand years later during What's called the Joe Dynasty okay until the Joe Dynasty which was founded in 1046 BC we hear nothing at all about Dau or the Sha okay so that's a big mystery therefore it seems more likely to me that Dau was a mythical culture hero you know maybe somehow associated with water maybe some sort of water spirit maybe a dragon than a real man okay so regardless of D's historicity I would posit that it is more important to discuss the figure of Dau the way he would be remembered and that memory's influence on Chinese culture even if he himself did not exist as I always say he may as well have okay this same is true for the xia Dynasty now what is certain is that sometime around this period sometime around 4,000 years ago nent Chinese civilization okay had reached a turning point a big Turning Point all right and around the time around this time around 4,000 years ago okay the there is this this long shine culture that existed in the Yellow River basin go back a video if you need to remember about the long Shan okay the long Shan culture which existed from five to four four suddenly vanished okay so this this this culture that it existed the civilization that had existed for a millennium suddenly vanished it s mysteriously collapsed and some sudden natural or social upheaval occurred which in folk memory may have been conflated with the changing climate at the time into the flood myth all right now Urban centers emptied seemingly overnight or at least they drastically shrank but at the same time again around for all right around 4,000 years ago a new urban center emerged to the South a new urban center emerged at what is now AR Le to Aro in central China's Hanan Province okay so here's our China okay and remember here's our Yellow River right so maybe the long Shan culture would have been around here somewhere the Aro culture is down in here okay so just a little bit to the South emerges what we now know today as the Aro culture from Hanan Province okay now the uh AR toe culture all right right appears to be from judging by the pottery and some of the artifacts we found it appears to be related to or at least influenced by long shine so the hypothesises long Shan gave rise to or at least influenced arito culture okay so long Shan 5 to four arito existed around Foria okay now another extremely important development occurred during this time the emergence of kingship Chinese Kings didn't really have crowns like that they had crowns that looked more like B boards I guess let's try to draw a Chinese Crow um here we go here we [Music] go something like that yeah the emergence of kingship okay and uh basically what we're seeing is archaeology ists in the year 2011 who were Excavating at arito in archaeologist 2011 ad not not BC but archaeologists in the present day 2011 are Excavating at Aro and they discovered this sprawling Palace complex at Aro that seems to indicate that around this time one of these big men that we've talked about got bigger and he made himself into what we'd call a king there was at some point one big man who achieved hegemony and made himself into something new a position maintained not by giftgiving but by coercion so maybe our King here needs move China battle ax right his his position is maintained not by giving gifts and throwing cool parties but by making people do what he tells them okay and to this day the written symbol okay remember hanza right hanza is a a Chinese written symbol for King this is the hanza for King king or Wang okay Wang this is the word for King all right and this symbol is really just a pictograph or sorry a pictogram of a battle axe which should tell you a little bit about how these guys maintained their power and not only did these badass Kings have access but these axes were made of something new bronze bronze this was a new material and it was a material that the rulers of the early toe culture seem to consider Central to and perhaps symbolic of their regime this importance is evidenced by the presence of what appears to be a bronze Foundry just south of the Aro Palace complex in the middle of the capital city bronze would continue to play a central role in Chinese ritual culture even to the present day if you ever go to a Chinese temple you will see offerings placed into these beautiful bronze cauldrons which is a direct continuation of the arito [Music] practices pretty cool huh another interesting thing about the arly toil culture is that its boundaries more or less made up or sorry more or less match up with those of what were given for the Shia Dynasty okay the kids outside hi okay uh what were given for the Sha Dynasty so if maybe I shouldn't have erased our China here's our China again and Yellow River oh sorry okay here's our Yellow River both the arito and the Shia Dynasty so the AR the archaological arito culture and the the the uh historically described Shia Dynasty match up to the same geographical area very interesting this coupled with the presence of what appears to be a royal palace okay suggests what it seems to imply and you almost don't want to say it because it's such a big deal that the Shia were not legendary that they did in fact exist and that arly to was their capital or at the very least that the arito culture would later be remembered as the Shia Dynasty wow but ultimately due to the absence of written documents this is the really important one due to the absence of written documents from the Aro culture we just can't be sure were these rulers in fact the Shia Dynasty or were they someone else did they even speak Chinese we may never know the most frustrating thing about this lack of written evidence is that it probably did exist but it just doesn't anymore I say this because the very earliest written Chinese that we have is from the like I say the 13th maybe 14th century BC which is really only a few centuries after AR however the writing from this time period is a fully mature script and that sort of thing usually doesn't just happen overnight okay so we're talking 14th 13th century BC and we're looking at a fully developed script a fully developed writing system was in place by the late 14th early 13th century BC okay now like I said say these things take time so what's probable is that this writing system existed in some form it probably underwent at least a few centuries of evolution before our oldest documents were found it had to have existed earlier it had to have and honestly the the the probability is that this writing system developed at the aroe culture okay um it's at least that's the most likely development another reason that I strongly suggest the arly toe civilization was literate is because of the accuracy of later records okay and there's a there's a Chinese history classic here okay that was written around the third fourth 4th Century BC called the bamboo animals okay the bamboo animals and the the bamboo animals uh contain a list of sha Kings along with those of the immediately succeeding Shang Dynasty okay so the Sha dynasty was succeeded by the Shang Dynasty and the bamboo animals contain a list of Shia and Shang Kings okay incredibly the dates and the names of the Shang Kings match up quite well with the names and dates given in the annals okay so the bamboo annals had to have had an earlier Source if it was going to have accurate records of the Shang Kings and we know these accur sorry we know these records are accurate because we've recovered Shang documents all right so this is 14th century 13th century so the bamboo animals accurately recorded the Shang Kings so it had to have had an earlier Source okay now sh was just a few centuries prior to this it doesn't seem completely unreasonable that the bamboo anal accurately list the Sha Kings as well as those of the Sha this would imply that somewhere down the line was a primary or at least near primary source so what happened where did these ancient sources disappear to there are a few ways we can answer this question the first and most probable is that the original documents were written on bamboo in ancient China we in Ancient Ancient China we would do our writing on these little slips of bamboo and we would bind them together in kind of a scroll okay and the problem with bamboo is what it decomposes organic material does not last long in the warm damp climate of Eastern China okay of course these Works would have been copied and circulated widely enough to be accessible to the writer of the bamboo animals so just to say that the source material Rott it away it's not enough it's not good enough that's where hypothesis number two comes in okay so hypothesis number one the the primary sources describing the Shia Dynasty rotted away because they were made of bamboo and bamboo rots hypothesis number two okay less than a century after the composition of the bamboo anals a psychopathic dictator named chin Shang chin Shang you might remember him from my Lord of the dings video he's the guy who finally brought together the great dings of power and he uh he's the one who they they fell into the river and were lost forever U no Gollum this time okay and so chiner hang was this Psychopathic dictator okay and as part of his Cult of Personality chiner hang decided to press the reset button on history and have everything begin with him the atrocity that followed is called the burning of the books the burning of books and burying of Scholars so poor Scholars uh the atrocity that followed was known as the burning of the books and the burying of Scholars okay and any written documents that mention history prior to chiner hang was outlawed and destroyed meanwhile the intelligencia was rounded up and killed kind of like another more recent Fiasco in Chinese history ironically the reason that we have texts like the anals is today is because chinchu Wang kept a personal library that he conveniently forgot to barbecue evidently this Library included the bamboo anals but the sources not or sorry but the sources used thereby were not included so we have the bamboo animals but not the sources for the bamboo animals so that gets rid of our primary sha Source documents hypothesis number three okay is that the written material of the Aro culture or the Sha Dynasty did exist but at some point in the intervening 4,000 years it was found ground up and used as medicine let me explain the reason that we have documentary evidence of the Shang Dynasty remember the the Shia was succeeded by the Shang okay so we have documentary evidence of the Shang Dynasty because during the middle Shang period a new technique emerged for recording information documents were engraved onto animal bones which of course last a long a lot longer than bamboo [Music] slips however this was a relatively late development and so no examples of pre Shang Oracle bone inscriptions have been identified but we only say that this appears to be a late development because we haven't found any yet from an earlier period so it doesn't mean that they weren't there so Oracle bones just because we think it was a late development doesn't mean that it was a late development there may have existed earlier Oracle bones okay and that that's what we call these bones with the writing on them okay and but the problem is that farmers in Hanan Province have been digging up these inscribed bones for centuries but it wasn't until recently that they were recognized as being written documents prior to that people were kind of dumbfounded they didn't know what to make of these mysterious bones covered in cool symbols so they decided that they were dragon bones and what do you do when you find a dragon bone well that's a stupid question obviously you grind it up and use it as medicine to treat malaria what else would you do it wasn't until the early 20th century that anyone realized that these cool symbols on the bones were actually writing indeed an early form of written Chinese directly ancestral to the hanza of today but it was too late we will never know how much ancient knowledge is has been lost What secrets will remain forever hidden all because some pharmacist wanted to make a quick Buck perhaps on one of those bones that was ground up and destroyed was evidence for the Shia Dynasty but someone unwittingly used it to treat malaria rather than its intended purpose of revolutionizing Chinese historiography so oh well so what happened to the documentary evidence of the arito culture aka the Shia dynasty was the aroe culture even the Shia Dynasty would it later be extrapolated to be the Shia Dynasty what do you think personally I remain optimistic that someday concrete proof will be Unearthed linking the arly to culture to the Sha Dynasty okay that's what I think and uh I'd love to hear you think too so that's it for today thanks for joining me up next origins of Chinese civilization part five the rise of the Shang Dynasty see you next [Music] time "
