"gobec Lee known as Potbelly Hill stands as a testament to ancient human Ingenuity amidst the Southeastern Anatolia region of modern day Turkey inhabited roughly from 9500 to at least 8,000 BC during the pre potery Neolithic period this archaeological Marvel boasts colossal circular structures housing the world's oldest megaliths these towering Stone pillars adorned with intricate anthropomorphic and animalistic carvings offer a tantalizing glimpse into the spiritual and cultural practices of our prehistoric ancestors hello everyone I'm the ASMR historian and welcome to the channel today we're going to talk about very ancient and mysterious Place GOC Lee so I invite you to relax and chill out a little bit as we learn something new together pached at top a rocky Mountaintop gobec Lee defies easy categorization despite lacking clear evidence of agricultural activity it emerged at the dawn of the Southwest Asian Neolithic period coinciding with the rise of Humanity's first permanent settlements Scholars are debating still whether the Advent of Agriculture prompted settlement or vice versa with GOC lie's Monumental complex serving as a focal point in this scholarly discourse recent excavations have unveiled evidence suggesting goek deepe functioned as more than just a ceremonial site discoveries of domestic structures water installations and tools associated with daily life hint at a bustling settlement rather than a mere pilgrimage site for nomatic hunter gatherers as previously proposed by early excavators such as Claus Schmidt we'll learn a little more about Claus Schmidt later on the purpose behind gobec Lee's megalithic enclosures remains shrouded in mystery initially dubbed the world's first temples these enigmatic structures were thought to have been intentionally backfilled as part of ritual practices however recent studies reveal a more complex history with evidence suggesting natural slop slide events played a role in their filling occasionally followed by repair and modification goly Dee's significance was not fully recognized until relatively recently discovered in a survey back in 1963 its true importance was realized by Claus Schmidt in 1994 leading to extensive excavations beginning the following year since Schmidt's unfortunate passing in 2004 ongoing excavations led by Turkish prehistorian nek mikaru in collaboration with Istanbul University Cura Museum and the German archaeological Institute continue to unravel the site secrets in 2018 gobec Lee received UNESCO world heritage recognition acknowledging its status as one of Humanity's earliest examples of monumental architecture despite years of study less than 5% of the sight has been explored which leaves us with much more to uncover about this ancient Marvel well today we are going to talk about what we have uncovered that 5% and at the time of recording this video it is what we know so let's get into it right from the very beginning gocke erected and inhabited during the earliest phase of the southwestern Neolithic known as the preot Neolithic PPN which was around 9600 to 7,000 remember this abbreviation PPN preot Neolithic will use it throughout the video along with other abbreviations it marks a pivotal moment as Humanity transitioned from hunter gatherer to settled Village Life now this period merging after the last ice age represents the dawn of permanent human settlements this is a milestone in our history a huge change within the PPN pre potery Neolithic Scholars recognize two subperiods pre potery Neolithic a from around 9600 to 88 800 BC and the pre potery Neolithic B ppnb from 8800 to 7,000 BC PPN villagers primarily consisted of clusters of stone or mud brick houses occasionally featuring Monumental structures like those found at gockley tee and other sites such as narii konu and jerf Lamar these communal buildings likely served as centers for social activities and may have played a role in fostering social cohesion as these communities expanded the distinctive t-shaped pillars a hmark of gobec lppe and prevalent in the Ura region are also found in many other PPN sites such as Nali and karande these pillars along with other Stone stay found across various sites offer us intriguing insights into the shared cultural practices and symbolic language of PPN communities showcasing a remarkable continuity of tradition across different settlements now during gobec Lee's occupation the climate of the region was notably warmer and wetter than compared to the present day the site was nestled within an expansive open step grassland deeming with wild cereals like in corn barley and wheat as well as diverse grazing animals such as sheep goats gazel and eits seasonal migrations likely brought large herds of goed gazelle past the site while evidence suggests a scarcity of substantial Woodlands nearby with the majority of recovered charcoal originating from pistachio or almond trees the emergence of settlements like gly teepe has long been linked to the Neolithic Revolution by the way Neolithic means New Stone so we have the new stone age Revolution the site from hunting and Gathering to agriculture shift rather however scholarly debates persist regarding whether the adoption of farming prompted settlement or vice versa highlighting the complexity and variability of this transition across Southwest Asia evidence from gcle tee suggests that its inhabitants were primarily hunter gatherers who supplemented their diet with early forms of domestic cereals and resided in villages at least part of the Year archaeological finds such as grinding stones and mortars point to extensive serial processing while traces of large scale gazelle hunting indicates seasonal subsistence practices water management was critical for sustaining life at goeke the Village ingeniously harvested rainwater through carved channels directing it into systemns carved into the Bedrock beneath the site with a capacity of at least 150 C cubic M additionally it's believed that a higher local water table may have activated dormant Springs closer to the site this of course provided them with additional water sources radiocarbon dating places the construction of gock lie's earlier structures between 9500 and 9,000 BC marking the tail end of the pre potery Neolithic a error over the next millennium the site underwent significant expansion it seems Village Life was taking off remaining active until around 8,000 BC or perhaps slightly later transitioning into the pre potery Neolithic b period bbnb intriguingly evidence suggests that smaller groups Revisited the site after its initial abandonment initial dating efforts by Claus Schmidt relied on Stone tool analysis favoring a ppna time frame however establishing the site's precise chronology proved to be very challenging early radiocarbon dates seem to conflict with expected timelines prompting Schmidt's team to explore alternative dating methods by analyzing organic material preserved in plaster on the structures walls they arrived at dates more aligned with the bpna occupation subsequent research led to a comprehensive revision of Schmidt's chronology refining the site's absolute time frame to span from 9500 to 8,000 BC encompassing the late ppna and ppnb period gobec Lee's architectural Evolution unfolds across eight distinct phases spanning over 1,500 years the initial settlement phase dated to the late 10th millennium BC witnessed the construction of the first circular enclosures alongside round oval domestic structures reflecting a burgeoning sedentary lifestyle subsequent phases or significant modifications to the enclosures including the incorporation of Monolithic t-shaped pillars and the gradual transition to rectangular floor plans in domestic buildings during the early PPA NB construction efforts began to intensify with the addition of rectangular structures uh being of domestic use and ongoing modifications to other enclosures however natural events such as slope slides caused extensive damage to the lower Ling structures leading to stabilization efforts and the eventual abandonment of some enclosures as building activity declined in the late 9th to early 8th Millennium smaller habitation structures emerged within the abandoned Village marking the Final Phase of occupation at golee the earliest circular compounds at Quebec liepe dating back to the latter half of the 10th millennium BC showcase remarkable architectural and artistic sophistication ranging from 10 to 30 m in diameter these structures boast t-shaped Limestone pillars meticulously arranged within thick interior walls constructed from unworked Stone initially four of these circular Marvels were Unearthed but geophysical surveys suggest the presence of up to 16 more housing nearly 200 pillars in total transported from Bedrock pits located approximately 100 100 m away these pillars adorned with abstract pictograms and intricate animal reliefs stand as the world's oldest megaliths at least at the moment there may be old the ones we haven't discovered yet at the heart of each circular enclosure two taller pillars stand facing one another their purpose is still a mystery while it's uncertain whether these structures were roofed Stone benches within the Interiors hint at communal Gatherings or perhaps rituals the pillars themselves are adorned with enigmatic symbols and depictions of various animals reflecting the diverse Wildlife that once thrived in the surrounding forested landscape notably humanoid figures are scarce in gobec Lee's Art though some f some pillars rather feature carved human arms and loin cloths suggesting stylized representations of humans or perhaps deities the absence of heads on these figures adds to their enigmatic nature leaving their intended significance open to the listener's interpretation why do you think they didn't have heads leave your thoughts in the comments I'd like to know I can't work it out in addition to the circular enclosures later structures at goe take on rectangular forms one reason for this could be to optimize space however they retain the iconic t-shaped pillars indicating continuity in cultural practices through pre potery Neolithic b period these rectangular enclosures with polished lime floors and Central te pillars continue to evoke ore with some adorned with Fierce looking lions owning the moniker lion pillar buildings carbon dating places the construction of these later structures between 8800 and 8,000 BC underscoring GBL Le te's enduring significance across Millennia slope slide events posed significant challenges to gbli Tee's enclosures situated over 10 M below the highest points of the settlement one particular devastating event occurred at the end of the early PPN b period inundating enclosures with rubble including domestic structures sediments and even burials this led to extensive damage and subsequent repairs including the construction of Terrace walls during building Phase 5 to mitigate future risks however these efforts prove to be insufficient as a second major slope slide likely led to the abandonment of certain enclosures during building Phase 6 around the late 9th millennium BC a similar fate befell other enclosures prompting the construction of new ones to replace them now previous assumptions that the large enclosure were intentionally backfilled have been reconsidered since the passing of Claus Schmidt remember he was the one of these early excavators working on the site passed away in the 2000s in terms of domestic structures early phases or the construction of round oval buildings alongside the large enclosures indicating a semi sedentary lifestyle over time there was a shift towards rectangular floor plans with only small structures erected in the final settlement phase regarding burials initial speculations suggested Graves could be located behind the walls of circular buildings in 200 17 fragments of human crania with incisions were discovered interpreted as evidence of a Neolithic skull cult other notable structures include a lionlike figure found at the western edge of the Hill possibly indicating a sculpture Workshop additionally there are three phallic depictions in the southern Plateau their dating Complicated by their proximity to classical quaries As Time progressed gepe gradually lost its significance with the Advent of Agriculture and animal husbandry ushering in new realities for the Region's inhabitants the site once a hub of commercial activity faded Into Obscurity as the needs and lifestyles of the local communities evolved the plateau of goe bears the marks of Millennia of erosion and quarrying activities which shaped its landscape over time four distinct channels each measuring 10 m in length and and 20 cm in width are visible on the southern part of the plateau believed to be remnants of an ancient Quarry used to extract rectangular blocks these channels may be associated with a nearby Square building speculated to be a Roman Watchtower from the later period though this is rather speculative indeed much of the plateau structures are attributed to Neolithic quarrying with the quaries serving as sources for the massive monolithic pillars found throughout the site these pillars were meticulously carved out of the rock bank with profiles pecked into the Rock before being detached and levered out several quaries were round work pieces were produced have also been identified confirming their status as qu quaries from the Neolithic era notably the three t-shaped pillars still embedded in the Bedrock remain unequivocally Neolithic with the largest lying on the Northern Plateau measuring 7 m in length and weighing an estimate ated 50 tons scholarly opinions vary on the labor required for constructing the site CL Schmid and his team argued that the sheer effort of quarrying transporting and erecting the heavy Limestone pillars would have necessitated a very large Workforce possibly coerced or enticed by a small religious Elite however alternative estimates suggest that a smaller group possibly as few as 7 to 14 people could have moved these pillars using ropes and lubricants similar to techniques employed in the construction of Stonehenge experiments conducted at gue itself suggest that all the structure currently exposed could have been built by 12 to 24 people in less than 4 months aligning with the capabilities of a Neolithic extended family or perhaps a village community additionally some enclosures were originally planned as single hierarchical complex formatting an equilateral Tri triangle According to some Scholars this layout hints at a deliberate architectural design and planning underscoring the site's significance as a center of communal and possibly religious activity now all over the site scattered pieces of Flint are everywhere both on its Ridgetop side and slopes which is reminiscent and pretty normal for a lot of the tool assemblages found at other pre potery Neolithic sites in the northern Levant Flint was basically the thing that you would make any early tool out of it was easy to shape and you could do a fair bit with it in 1963 an extensive collection ction of over 3,000 Neolithic tools was Unearthed at the site predominantly crafted from high quality Flint with only a few made from obsidian this impressive array included cores various types of blades flakes scrapers and projectile points reflecting the diverse tool making activities of G Tee's ancient inhabitants an excavation of a another space being space 16 a small building adjacent to enclosure D yielded nearly 700 DS offering further insights into their craftsmanship among these discoveries retouched artifacts were the most prevalent followed by scrapers perforators and even items with gloss additionally heavy duty tools like burins and microliths were among the artifacts discovered highlighting the versatility of the tool makers there now of course we have to hear what clous Schmidt thought of all this as he was the the expert he proposed gocke as a stone age Mountain Sanctuary suggesting it served as a central hub for a cult of the Dead with intricately carved animals serving as Protectors of the deceased and all those lion heads that were crafted perhaps they were there to make sure no bad had Spirits got in the abundance of butchered bones including those from local games such as deer gazelle pigs and geese indicates that the site was also utilized for hunting and feasting activities likely time to coincide with Peak game availability during certain Seasons Schmidt envisioned the cons construction of the site as a significant step in the development of urban civilization he also speculated on the belief systems of the groups behind goeke proposing shamanic practices and interpreting the t-shaped pillars as representations of human forms possibly ancestors he suggested that a fully articulated belief in deities perhaps didn't emerge until later associating it with Mesopotamia and extensive Temple structures this interpretation aligns with the ancient Sumerian myths linking Agriculture and weaving to sacred mountains inhabited by ancient deities the absence of depictions of organized violence in the carvings along with the prominence of formidable creatures like lions and snakes suggests a focus on ritual and symbolic rather than practical elements some interpretations view the site's iconography as a cosmogonic map linking the community to the surrounding landscape and the outer Cosmos challenges to the notion of gobec lie solely serving as a cultic purpose have Arisen with suggestions that the structures could have functioned as large communal houses akin to those found in the northwest coast of North America the practice of burying existing pillars every few decades to replace them with new Stones also remains a mystery recent revisions of the SES narrative have been prompted by discoveries of domestic buildings and rainwater harvesting systems indicating a more complex interplay between ritual and practical functions in 2018 kcly tee was so many years later honored with a designation of a UNESCO world heritage site acknowledging its remarkable Universal value as one of the earliest examples of monumental architecture crafted by human hands despite this prestigious Rec ignition as of 2021 only a small fraction of the site has been excavated that's about 5% leaving much of its Mysteries still buried beneath the Earth and speaking of mysteries there are other theories and of course with with all theories it's open to interpretation as we've said there's so much more that we need to find out about gobec liepe but just indulge me for a moment and we'll talk about a few of the things that have come up in the internet circles so we know that the burial of the enclosures at G tee distinguishes it from other archaeological sites like Jericho for example where accumulation of debris over time formed artificial Hills now it seems that most people would say that gobli Tee's enclosures were intentionally buried although some may have been covered by natural catastrophes another point of debate some evidence suggests that the barrier was planned from the outset they found some sculptures tools and other objects placed at the base of some of these tea pillars prior to burial now the reason for burying these enclosures remains unclear but some people have speculated that each T pillar represented a community leader or community group so it may have been that a monument was erected at the start when a new person would come into power or we had some new group and it would serve as a kind of a burial marking perhaps not burying the body there but just putting up the monument while this person lived once again just a theory now the fill material used to bury the enclosures contains Limestone and Rubble but also bone fragments both animal and human now the large volume of Bones including those of gazel and wild cattle suggests that they were doing a lot of hunting human bone fragments treated similarly to animal bones were also found with some displaying processing marks including def fleshing the fragments of human skulls some with evidence of postmortem modification were discovered possibly representing an ancestor worship or displays of defeated enemies so that is is indeed presence of a rather extensive skull cult now we could imagine or speculate if we're going to speak in such uh confined terms that these skulls were perhaps taken from the dead and used to venerate them after death they would be displayed as kind of a Keepsake or perhaps taken as trophies from defeated enemies whichever the case may be there were skulls all over the place at the site now we already know that the site is very old but some suggest that the site could be even older now Carbon 14 dating indicates that the filling of enclosures began around 11,000 700 to 11,300 but the construction date of the site remains uncertain I remember Schmidt that lead archaeologist he speculates that the earliest structures the earliest of the early may be up to 14,000 or 15,000 years old of course this is significant older than the Pyramids of Giza the site was abandoned about 10,000 years ago unfortunately leaving much of its history still buried perhaps we'll find something more that can help us carbon date with more accuracy now of course we are currently doing the best we can to conserve the site however conservation efforts at the site have not been without their own controversy in 2018 sigm kokal Schmidt an archaeologist and the Widow of klous Schmidt raise concerns about damage caused by the use of concrete and heavy machinery during the construction of a new walkway well in response to this the minister hisory of culture and tourism in Turkey refuted the claims asserting that no concrete was used and no damage had occurred as a result of the conservation work certainly a delicate balance between tourism and archaeology always well the best way for us to conserve these sites is to have AR ologists on the board of the people who organize the conservation efforts we cannot just have the Department of Tourism thinking about how we can get the most amount of visitors in and charge the most amount of money for the ticket prices that being said I'm not sure if they're charging to enter the site one can only assume that they are and you can certainly see it for yourself if you are so inclined to head to the site in modern-day turkey or turkia as it is now called and you will find out for yourself perhaps you will be the one who finds something and solves the mystery just make sure you ask for permission before you get your pickaxe and shovel out well thank you very much for joining me today it's been a pleasure generally we're looking at Bronze Age societies but a pre-bronze age Society well that is something special I'm the ASMR historian doing the best I can and I will see you in the next video good night everybody see for for that that that that for e for for for "
