"- [Instructor] We are\nnow going to go the east and explore Ancient China. And we're going to do that in\nthe second millennium B.C.E., where we see some of the\nfirst great dynasties of Ancient China emerging. So if we go to roughly\nthe 16th century, B.C.E., so that would be about 3600 years ago, we have the emergence\nof the Shang Dynasty, and what's significant\nabout the Shang Dynasty is it's the first dynasty\nwhere we have significant archaeological evidence of its existence. We have a lot of evidence\nin this area where, do you see, highlighted in\nred, where the Shang Dynasty existed with its capital at Yin, near the modern-day city of Anyang. Now, we have accounts\nof a Dynasty before it, the Xia or the Chia Dynasty,\nalthough we do not have significant archaeological evidence of it. But the accounts say that the Xia Dynasty would have been around\nfor roughly 500 years before we get to this 16th century B.C.E., with the emergence of the Shang Dynasty. Now just to get ourselves\nacquainted in time and space, and think about, well\nwhat else was happening around 1600 B.C.E., we\ncould remind ourselves that that was during the new\nkingdom in Ancient Egypt, right around here, the\nheight of Ancient Egypt's power was right around that time. We could think about the Hittite Empire that we study in other videos, we could think about Mycenaean Greece. Around 1600 B.C.E. is\nwhen you start having, or when you have the\ndecline of the Indus Valley civilization, also known as\nthe Harappan civilization, and you start to have the Vedic period, where you have these Indo-Aryan people start to migrate into Northern India. In Mesopotamia, you have\nthe Assyrian Middle Kingdom right around here, so\nthis is all happening in this mid- to late-second\nmillennium B.C.E., which is roughly the time\nof the Shang Dynasty. Now the Shang Dynasty was\nknown for many things, it was a Bronze Age culture,\nand you can see depicted here, many examples of that and\nthis is pretty impressive work with bronze, this\nis a bronze battle axe right over here, you can\nimagine a handle for this axe, something like this, this\nis nothing that you would want to deal with in a battle,\nand you can see these other very significant, large,\nbronze crafts, handiwork, that the Shang Dynasty\nwas able to produce. Now what the Shang Dynasty\nis also well-known for is their writing, it's the first evidence of a fairly advanced writing form, and it's related to modern Chinese. And a lot of that writing,\nthe significant artifacts from that time are on what\nare called oracle bones. That's an oracle bone right over here, this is actually the scapula,\nthe shoulder blade of an ox, and what they would do is\nthey would write questions in this oracle bone script on\ntop of that scapula of an ox and then they would heat it up in a flame or some type of source\nof heat until it cracks and then they would interpret the cracks to see what was the answer\nto their actual questions. And you can actually see\nhow this oracle bone script is related to modern Chinese script. So this is Shang written\nin oracle bone script and you can see how it evolved over time to the modern-day Chinese script. Even though if you go\nstraight from that to that, they look reasonably different, but when you look at the evolution, you can see that they\nhave lot of commonality. You also see it in words, right over here, shows you evolution of the word tiger, and once again, this is\nthe oracle bone script and you can see it looks\nright here like a picture of a tiger, but then it evolved over time to the modern form right over here. Now, this Shang civilization,\nit's no coincidence that first the Xia and then the Shang, that they develop over\nhere in the yellow river and the Yangtze River valleys,\nwe've talked about it, the Ancient Egyptians, the Mesopotamians, all of the Indus Valley civilization, they all started where\nagriculture first emerged, which tended to be in these\nriver valley civilizations. Now the Shang in particular,\nnot only were they known for their bronze work, they were known for their large cities, they were known for their\ncomplex social structures, they were known especially near\nthe end of the Shang period, for having chariots, and some people think that because they had chariots, there might have been contacts\nwith folks further west. Now the Shang Dynasty, I said\nhow the Xia Dynasty lasted for over 500 years, and the\nShang Dynasty also lasts for on the order of 500 years, which is a very very very very long time. But as we get to the middle\nof the 11th century B.C.E., it would reach its end. The last king of the Shang\nDynasty is this gentleman right over here, this\nwould be Dix Xin or Di Shin and the accounts have\nhim initially in his rule as being a very capable\nruler, but later in his rule, he seems to get more corrupt,\nbecomes less competent of a ruler, his favorite\nconsort Daji, right over here, she's a bit of a not-so-popular\nfigure in Chinese history, a lot of people think that she helped, or they blame her for corrupting Di Xin, and so he eventually faces his end in the Battle of Muye,\nagainst King Wu of Zhou or Joe is actually the correct\npronouncing, King Wu of Zhou, and King Wu of Zhou is\nable to defeat Di Xin at the Battle of Muye, and that\nis the end of Shang Dynasty and it begins the Zhou\nDynasty, which will go on for another 800 years,\nthat's pretty impressive, how continuous these\ndynasties actually are, and after that battle, Di Xin\ngoes off and commits suicide, and this right over here is a depiction of King Wu of Zhou, who\nstarts the Zhou Dynasty. But the big picture here\nis we're talking about huge swaths of time and we have a significant, I guess you could say,\ncivilization, that started with the river valleys\nin China but it's amazing how continuous these civilizations were and it's almost amazing how\nmodern their writing was relative to modern Chinese script and that's why historians\nbelieve that writing of this form was, because of how advanced it was, was probably in place\nfor a long time before we see these oracle bones,\nso even though we don't have the strong archaeological evidence yet for the Xia Dynasty,\nthere's a lot of evidence that by the time the Shang came about, the Chinese civilization was\nalready quite well-developed around the Yellow River and the Yangtze.
