"[Music] hello everyone and welcome back so today civilization is dense embrace settling in Lombardy and other surrounding regions in the padana plains the numbers are remembered for their very mix and diverse culture that was influenced by its neighbors in particular the league Juarez Tetra seconds in the cells the last of which integrated well among the in sombras when they migrated in Italy in 400 BC of all the civilizations we have covered so far the numbers are the ones of which less is known personally I think it's because they are adopted so many things from so many cultures that they fail to live a concretely unique identity so far most of the research has confirmed that they were really natives of Italy in not obscenity origins they were cousins of the League race but as more Celts started moving in they started to mix in there is a no physical surviving description all about the in sombras looked but it seems that they were not so different from today's population of Lombardi so really nothing special regardless they in sombras did indeed have their own identity they all lived united under a king and spoke the same language they knew how to write but they never developed an alphabet of their own using primarily date Ruskin alphabet in the delorean one their fate really depended on various preferences as many just believed in Celtic cards adding some native beliefs into the pile they are famously credited for founding Milan which was called Manila room back there in 590 BC and are also credited for starting its ironworking traditions in Serbian Smiths were considered the best in Italy for the longest time the Romans did indeed learn a lot from their hearts speaking of Romans let's talk about them fighting now the in sombras were not as easy to annex as the Bonetti but not as hard as it has to some nights they were indeed strong fighters with really good armor but the path that they were united really gave Roman advantage the conflict with Rome was started in 228 BC when the Romans decided to take revenge of the cenotes in took over their land the numbers were not very happy about this so they called their Celtic friends and made an alliance in 225 they tried to weaken the Roman colony of Sochi but were actually defeated the cintamani tribe a celtic tribe who lived south from Liberty sided with Rome in helping and help them in a campaign against things from Britain to undertake 2/3 and 222 but the conflict ended with a stalemate however during this conflict we get the first mention of an in sunburst King this one was called v-ray tomorrow and no illustration of him exist as we know his name only because he dies in the battle in 221 Roman captures middle Adam enforces these numbers to ally with them the numbers were not very happy but in 218 Anibal arrived in northern Italy they decided to join him in his little adventure and kicking Roman ass until the tables had turned and it was animal that was getting spanked badly like the bad boy years in 194 in sombras indefinitely allied with the Romans and in 49 BC they got Roman citizenship along all the north Italians under Roman rule after that the in sombras integrated into the Roman Empire pretty well a male atom I mean belong as many buildings who have witnessed such ultras wing so guys that will be it we have covered all the major Italian civilizations and we definitely do not forget anyone I will be back as soon as I can with a brand new video about a new historical topic feel free to tell me what you would like to see next [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] see ya "
