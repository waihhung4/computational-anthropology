"Ancient Mesopotamia A society or civilization is a group of people\nof all ages and backgrounds who live, work, and play together. Things like entertainment and technology,\nhomes and schools, government and businesses, make up a civilization. You live in a modern civilization. In contrast, an ancient civilization existed\nthousands of years ago. We can learn many important things from ancient\ncivilizations. This video is about ancient Mesopotamia, which\nwas the first civilization in the world! This was the first time that people gathered\ninto large cities. They learned to read and write and they formed\ngovernments to establish order. That\u2019s why ancient Mesopotamia became the\nfoundation for all future civilizations of nations and empires. Ancient Mesopotamia was mostly located in\nan area known today as Iraq as well as in the present day countries of Iran, Turkey,\nand Syria. That area today has a very dry climate. It\u2019s mostly desert, with hot temperatures\nand little rainfall. That makes it difficult for farming. But thousands of years ago, that wasn\u2019t\nthe case. The word \u201cMesopotamia\u201d means \u201cthe land\nbetween rivers\u201d. It was named that because it was located between\nthe Tigris and the Euphrates rivers. The rivers helped many plants to grow and\nthe area was very green due to the rich soil and occasional rain that fell throughout the\nyear. The plants in that area attracted many animals\nto the region. The people living there hunted the animals\nand gathered the plants. They were called hunters and gatherers. If they couldn\u2019t find enough food or animals\nto gather and hunt, they would have to move around to different regions to find food. Around 8,000 BC, the people slowly discovered\nthat if they planted a seed, a plant would grow from that seed. This was a life changing discovery. The people no longer had to rely only on the\nplants that grew naturally. Now, they could grow their own plants using\nseeds that could be planted in many different areas. This was the beginning of agriculture, or\nfarming. The people started to take the natural plants\nand turn them into crops. The farmers of Mesopotamia began to grow plants\nlike barley, wheat, onions, garlic, and lettuce. Farmers also began to raise animals on their\nfarms, like sheep, cows, pigs, donkeys, and oxen. Much more food was available with farming\nthan there was with hunting and gathering. Farmers could now grow food for an entire\nvillage. Because of this, people did not need to travel\nfrom place to place to find food anymore. They could settle, or live, in one place. Irrigation was discovered during this time. It was a way to water farmland without having\nto wait for rain. Water from the flooded rivers could be saved\nin pools and canals for use during dry times. This is what we do today. Maybe you have seen some irrigation canals\nnear your neighborhood. The Mesopotamians built canals that could\ntake water from one of the rivers they lived near and transport it to many farms in the\narea. Irrigation and farming made it easier for\npeople who lived in that area, so more people began to settle and live there as well. They began to form villages and towns. Over time, those villages grew into larger\ntowns and cities. As time passed, more inventions, advancements,\nand growth occurred and Mesopotamia became the first human civilization in the world. As the people became more organized and the\ncities grew, they developed into a civilization they called Sumer. The people of Mesopotamia called themselves\nSumerians. Sumerians built their homes and buildings\nwith bricks made from mud and straw baked in the sun. They called their large cities \u201cCity States\u201d. A city named Eridu was created first. It was one of the oldest cities in the world. Ruins from Eridu still exist today. Different city states sometimes fought each\nother, which lead them to build walls around their individual cities for protection. But their farms were located on the outside\nof the city walls. When invaders came into the area, the people\nwould have to run back into the city for safety. Each of the city states had its own ruler. The rulers were like kings or governors. Sometimes they were also religious leaders. If the person was a ruler and a religious\nleader, they had more power. The forming of government is often credited\nto the Sumerians. Their government leaders oversaw building\nprojects and tried to keep the city running smoothly. Religion was very important to the Sumerians. In the center of every city, there was a large\ntemple called a Ziggurat. It was dedicated to each city\u2019s main god. A Ziggurat looked like a pyramid with lots\nof steps leading to a flat top. A priest performed religious rituals and sacrifices\nin these temples. The Sumerians were polytheistic, which means\nthat they worship many gods. They believe their kings descended, or came\nfrom, the gods. They also believed that the earth was flat\nand that the stars were little holes in the sky where light from the heavens shone through. The Sumerians earned money for the various\njobs they did. Those that earned more money wore nicer clothing\nand lived in better homes than those that earned less money. The Sumerians began to live differently from\neach other based on how much money they made and they soon divided into social classes. People in the lower class made the least amount\nof money. The middle class made more money than the\nlower class. And the richest people were called the upper\nclass. These classes, or groups of people, still\nexist in society today. The Sumerians lived in the Mesopotamian region. Other city states like Akkad and Babylon became\nmore powerful than Sumer. These city states grew into empires. They fought each other and conquered areas\nnear them. A king named King Hammurabi created an empire\nout of the former kingdoms of Sumer and Akkad. Babylon became the capital city of that empire. It became most famous for its architecture,\ngovernment, and laws. Mesopotamians have laws that govern them. If a citizen broke one of the laws, they were\npunished. King Hammurabi created 282 laws called the\n\u201cCode of Hammurabi\u201d. The laws were engraved on a 7 foot tall stone\npillar that still exists. It is preserved in the Louvre Museum in France. Here are a few Hammurabi\u2019s laws and punishments. See if you think they are fair. If a man hit another man that was considered\na higher class than he, that man was whipped 60 times. If a man caused someone to go blind, then\nhis eye was blinded. Maybe you\u2019ve heard the saying \u201can eye\nfor an eye,\u201d which means if you do something bad to someone, they can do it back to you. That saying comes from the Code of Hammurabi. Do those punishments sound harsh? Are you grateful you aren\u2019t ruled by those\nsame laws today? Many years after Babylon was formed, another\ncity state called Assyria conquered Babylon. Assyria became the first military power in\nhistory, which means they were the first people to create a large and powerful army. Their army used camels and chariots with metal\nwheels. Persia, another city state, came to power\nafter defeating Assyria. They became the largest empire. They eventually controlled most of Mesopotamia\nand ancient Egypt. They built the Persian royal road, which was\nan ancient highway that helped people travel quickly throughout the empire. Messengers that rode on horses could travel\n1,677 miles - that\u2019s 1,677 miles - on the road in just 7 days! It took them 90 days if they were walking. Can you imagine being a messenger back then\nand walking three months just to deliver a single message? It kind of makes you grateful for text messaging. The Persian royal road also increased long-distance\ntrade. A religion called Zoroastrianism became a\nmajor religion in ancient Persia. It was different than polytheism. Zoroastrianism was the belief in only one\ngod. Another word for that is monotheism. A lot of technology was developed during the\nancient Mesopotamian era. Here are some of the inventions that came\nfrom that time period. The wheel! Ancient Mesopotamians were the first to use\nthe wheel for a wagon. This helped with transportation, farming,\nand trade. The number system. Instead of using a number system based on\n10, they used a system based on 60. This was used for minutes and seconds. They also used a twelve month calendar and\na seven day week calendar. In addition, they divided a circle into 360\ndegrees. This system is still used today. Writing! Ancient Mesopotamians developed one of the\nearliest methods to record information. Using pictures for symbols, they came up with\na type of writing called Cuneiform. The symbols represented sounds just like our\nmodern alphabet. Scribes, who were the only people at that\ntime that knew how to write, used a wedge-shaped tool to press sticks and reeds into wet clay\ntablets to make the symbols. They used those tablets to write on because\npaper hadn\u2019t been invented yet. Astronomy. Using advanced math, they recorded the movements\nof the stars, planets, and the moon. This information was used to create the first\ncalendar. Medicines. Babylonians recorded medical history to diagnose\nand treat illnesses with creams and pills. Your society still does that today. When you go to the doctor or dentist, they\nkeep a chart or medical record all about you. Your past medical history helps them know\nhow to help you. Glasswork. Assyrians developed glazes for glasswork,\npottery, and art to help it last longer. A few other inventions included: a potter\u2019s\nwheel, bronze metal to make tools, looms to weave cloth from wool, maps, and a simple\nmachine called Archimedes\u2019 screw for lifting water to higher levels. Mesopotamia existed at least 8,000 years ago. It lasted for thousands of years until the\nPersian empire was destroyed. The important period in history influenced\nmany aspects of the civilizations that came after it. Archaeologists continue to learn new things\nfrom artifacts and writings made by these ancient people. Thanks for following Clarendon Learning. Be sure to subscribe.
