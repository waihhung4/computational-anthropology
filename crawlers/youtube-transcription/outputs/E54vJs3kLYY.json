"[Music] hello everybody happy january in the last video i discuss the geography of china this week i dive deeper into chinese history and focus on the beginnings of chinese civilization over the course of china's 5 000 year history there were many dynasties that ruled this vast territory remember a dynasty is a family that rules over a kingdom or an empire this video will focus on the shang dynasty more specifically this video focuses on the rise of the shang dynasty shang government and social structure shang religious practices shang artistic styles and examples and the fall of the shang dynasty again one of china's first dynasties was the shang dynasty for hundreds of years the shang dynasty was considered a legend but then evidence started mounting that indeed the shang dynasty existed with the discovery of markings on animal bones and the discovery of the ruins of anyone the shun capital the shang dynasty ruled from 1750 bce to 1040 bce and it started in the north china plain near the mighty huanghi river eventually the shang dynasty collapsed and i will talk more about that towards the end of this video next on the list is shang government what was the shang government like shang kings kept their power through family ties and using the strength of their military xiang's society was divided into six social classes these included the king and his clan the nobles who were the landowners the artisans people who made things traders people who bought and sold things farmers people who grew and raised things and slaves who were the lowest social class with little freedom when a king died the power was transferred to another brother or the king's son the king divided his empire into smaller kingdoms and had his relatives rule over these kingdoms to maintain power xiang armies used bronze weapons and the shang were one of the first civilizations to use bronze [Music] next on the list is shang religion the shang practiced ancestor worship and believed that there was an afterlife similar to the egyptians beliefs and what happened after one died the shang believed that the dead could harm or help the living to respect their dead ancestors the shang gave offerings of food and even human sacrifices sometimes the remains of the ancestors were buried underneath shung homes oracle bones were used to seek the advice of the ancestors an oracle bone is a piece of animal bone from turtle shells or sometimes the shoulder blade of a cow holy men would crack the bones under heat and read the cracks to give advice to the king [Music] the next topic is shang art shang artists were very skilled at using bronze they made vessels made of bronze with geometric designs and pictures of fantastic creatures another example of art was the animal mask called a tau ta i hope i'm pronouncing that right the shang also made jewelry and other pieces from jade jade is usually green in color and is considered a precious stone jade symbolizes wisdom and kindness and was highly valued by the chinese the shang also made artwork from gold for example here's a piece called the sun and immortal bird gold foil this is probably from the late shang dynasty around 1100 bc in 2005 the sun and immortal bird image was selected as the logo for chinese cultural heritage last on the list we have the downfall of the shang dynasty the shang dynasty lasted for about 500 years in the huanghi river valley but just like all empires they rise and they fall three main factors contributed to the downfall of the sham these include constant warfare which weakened their ability to fight off enemies from within and outside the empire second lavish spending on palaces and tombs weakened the economy and finally the corruption of the ruling class the last shang king was rumored to spend all his time hunting rather than helping his subjects the shang were overthrown by the zhao dynasty under king wu it is rumored that the last shang king ran away from battle put on all his jewelry and jumped into the flames of a fire in this pepi list i covered five main topics these include the shang dynasty shang government sean and the fall of the shang dynasty i hope you like this peppy list please subscribe remember in my last video i discussed chinese geography if you're interested in learning more topics about china my next video will be about the chinese philosophies "
