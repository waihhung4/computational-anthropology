"For regular videos on ancient cultures and\nforgotten civilizations. please subscribe. Every year archaeologists make exciting new\ndiscoveries, and these discoveries \u2013 every single one of them \u2013 rewrite history in\nsome way. And for those of you who aren\u2019t aware, there\nare so many finds being made all the time that I do a monthly livestream going over\nsome of the more interesting artifacts found in a single month. But now it is time to look back at the whole\nyear. And so I have picked out what I think are\nthe 20 best discoveries in archaeology. Mind you, since I am a historian of ancient\ntimes, I have chosen only the discoveries relating to ancient times. So nothing here from prehistory or medieval\ntimes. Still, there is much here to marvel at. I hope you enjoy hearing about these as much\nas I did. So here we go. #20 Bronze age network of enclosures in Serbia\nMore than 100 previously-unknown structures have been identified in Serbia using Google\nEarth and aircraft reconnaissance. 3600-year-old walls and ditches (this is their Bronze Age)\nwere found in the Pannonian Plain, an area that includes parts of Romania, Hungary, and\nSerbia. These sites were thought to be isolated during\nthe Bronze Age, but this discovery by archaeologists from the University College of Dublin reveal\nthat the sites may have been part of a network of settlements, seasonal gatherings, ceremonials,\nor cattle pens, stretching over 90 miles along the Tisza River. #19 Ancient Chinese Water Conservation Facility Chinese researchers excavating the Qianqui\nGate site in the ancient capital city of Luoyang have discovered over 80 meters of water channels\ndating back to the Wei and Jin Dynasties (220 to 420 CE). The channels display advanced water conservation\ntechniques coupled with efficient resource utilization (like rainwater collection). The discovery, including stone culverts running\nparallel, and illustrating a unified construction plan, not only has contributed to our understanding\nof Luoyang's royal garden layout, but has shown technology we didn\u2019t know that had\nat the time. #18 Multiple new discoveries at Saqqara The tomb of Panehsy (the steward of the Amun\nTemple during the early Ramesside period), four well-preserved tomb chapels, (one belonging\nto a man named Yuyu a gold foil-maker for the Pharaoh's treasury), and two complete\nembalming workshops for both humans and animals were discovered in the Saqqara Necropolis. The first embalming workshop dates to 380-343\nBCE, the second to 305-30 BCE, and the tombs date to the Old and New Kingdoms of Egypt. Panehsy's tomb resembles a freestanding temple\nwith a gate entrance, and is located next to that of Maya, a high ranking official during\nthe reign of Tutankhamun, which I visited last year. The walls of Panehsy\u2019s tomb are adorned\nwith colorful reliefs, and depict Panehsy, his wife Baia, priests, and offering bearers. #17 World Oldest Shipyard The world's largest and oldest known ancient\nshipyard was discovered on Dana Island in T\u00fcrkiye's Mersin province by the Department\nof Cultural Heritage Preservation and Restoration at Akdeniz University. The shipyard was built during the Greek Dark\nAge, shortly after 1200 BCE, and it is possible that this island was the original home of\nthe Denyen, one of the tribes of the Sea Peoples. Later it would have been taken by the Greeks. The shipyard began to be uncovered in 2015,\nbut only now its full size has been determined. It includes 294 slipways, allowing for nearly\n300 warships to be built simultaneously. The archaeologists say that this many slipways\ncould have significantly influenced Mediterranean political, military, and commercial balances. The ships built at Dana Island played roles\nin various historic naval battles, including conflicts between Greeks and Persians. #16 4,000-Year-Old Temple in Peru Archaeologists at UNSM in Peru discovered\na 4000-year-old U-shaped temple at the Miraflores archaeological site in western Peru. And the temple features a chakana carved into\na frieze. This chakana (an ancient cross symbol used\nby the later Andean peoples) is the oldest complete representation found in the Andes\nand reinforces the long cultural and religious tradition related to this symbol in ancient\nPeruvian cultures, from as early as 4000 years ago up to the Inca period! Very interesting. #15 Sunken Greco-Egyptian Temples A joint Egyptian-French archaeological mission\nheaded by Frank Goddio and the Department of Underwater Archaeology of the Ministry\nof Tourism and Antiquities in the submerged city of Thonis-Heraklion (near Alexandria)\ndiscovered temples dedicated to the ancient Greek goddess Aphrodite and the Egyptian god\nAmun. Aphrodite\u2019s temple contained Greek bronze\nand ceramic artifacts, and Amun\u2019s contained silver ritual instruments, gold jewelry, and\nalabaster containers for perfumes. Both discoveries were sitting on top of wooden\nposts and beams that have been carbon dated to the fifth century BCE. These discoveries were made possible thanks\nto new geophysical prospecting technologies that allowed the teams to detect objects underneath\nmultiple layers of clay. These finds help to reinforce the significance\nof Thonis-Heraklion as Egypt's largest Mediterranean port prior to Alexandria's founding. #14 Zapotec Tunnels under Catholic Church Have you heard of the Zapotecs? They were an ancient Mesoamerican culture. Mexican researchers using cutting edge ground\nscanning technology have found beneath the San Pablo Apostol church in Mitla, Oaxaca,\na hidden \"underworld\" (consisting of a chamber and tunnel system) that was connected to the\nZapotec cult of the dead. The Zapotecs, thriving near Oaxaca since the\nlate sixth century BCE, built this complex system of chambers and tunnels. The church is on the spot of a once-important\nZapotec religious center, and the findings confirm historical accounts of rituals and\nceremonies conducted in subterranean chambers associated with the dead. #13 Han Dynasty tombs in China In two places in China this year, tombs from\nthe Han Dynasty were discovered. On a local hill in Laozhuangshi, in Henan\nprovince, a cluster of 22 ancient tombs spanning nearly 1600 years has been discovered. Two of the tombs are from the Eastern Han\nDynasty (25-220 CE). The others are from the later Song, Ming,\nand Qing dynasties. Then in the Wulong District near Chongqing,\na collection of tombs dating from the Han Dynasty to the Six Dynasties period (222-589\nCE) were found. The most significant of these tombs was one\nfrom the Western Han Dynasty, which they were able to date precisely to 193 BCE. Found in it were more than 600 precious artifacts,\nincluding lacquerware, wood ware, bamboo ware, pottery, and bronze ware. This is the largest quantity of lacquered\nwood and bamboo wares ever found in one place in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River. Further study of the tomb contents will no\ndoubt shine more light on this period. #12 Five-Story-Tall Pyramids in the Yucat\u00e1n. While working in the Yuc\u00e1tan peninsula\u2019s\njungle, Archaeologists from Mexico\u2019s National Institute for Anthropology and History and\nthe University of Houston discovered an entire ancient Maya city, known as Ocomt\u00fan, or \u2018Stone\nColumn\u2019. They found the site using airborne laser scanning. Containing 45+ foot tall Pyramid-like structures,\nthis late classic Maya city was inhabited between 600 and 800 CE (The Late Classic). #11 New Fragments of the Fasti Ostienses For those who don\u2019t know, the Fasti Ostienses\nare inscriptions that make up a list of Roman magistrates and significant events. They were originally engraved on marble slabs\nand exhibited publicly in Ostia, a port town near Rome. But in later times the marble was reused for\nother buildings. So pieces of them can be found all over the\nplace. Well, new fragments of the Fasti Ostienses\nhave been discovered at the Ostia Antica Archaeological Park in Italy by the Ostia Post Scriptum excavation\nproject. One of the newly recovered fasti fragments\nfits together with another previously found fragment, which dates to 128 CE during the\nreign of Emperor Hadrian, and which details events from that year, including Hadrian receiving\nthe title pater patriae (father of his country) on January 10, and his wife Sabina receiving\nthe title of Augusta. Other important information is contained on\nthese fragments as well. This is important, because the Fasti are one\nof the most important sources for the chronology of the late Roman Republic and early Roman\nEmpire. So far, all the known fragments cover the\nperiod 49 BCE to 175 CE. #10 Shang Dynasty town in Northern China. At the Zhaigou archaeological site in northern\nChina, a complete Bronze Age town was discovered. The town dates back to the early Shang Dynasty,\nover 3000 years ago, and holds hundreds of artifacts like bronze drinking vessels, painted\npottery, and jade ornaments. Covering over 1.2 square miles, the Zhaigou\narchaeological site is one of the largest from the Shang Dynasty and provides insights\ninto their cultural and social organization. Archaeologists also found nine aristocratic\ntombs here, indicating that the site may have been the capital of a state later assimilated\nby the Shang Dynasty. #9 Oldest known town gate in Israel Near Kiryat at Tel Erani, a 5500-year-old\ntown gate made of huge stones and mud bricks was discovered. The gate dates to the Bronze IB period and\nsuggests that settlements in the area date to as early as 3500 BCE. The excavations site director described the\ngate as an indication of transition from scattered living to urbanized city life with fortified\nwalls. The gate was likely a mandatory passageway\nfor all entering the city, serving both as a defense and a symbol of the town\u2019s importance. This discovery surpasses the prior oldest\nknown gate from Tel Arad, which dates to approximately 5200 years old. #8 2500-Year-Old Tartessian Stone Busts Spanish archeologists have discovered five\nlife-size stone busts depicting gods of the ancient Tartessos civilization (5th century\nBCE) in a sealed pit in southern Spain near Guadiana valley. The site is home to an adobe temple at Casas\ndel Turu\u00f1uelo, and revealed two nearly complete figurative reliefs, likely representing female\ndivinities adorned with gold earrings, and fragments of three others, one identified\nas a warrior wearing a helmet. This discovery has helped to change scholars\u2019\nviews of Tartessian culture, which was previously understood as aniconic, or only proscribing\ndivinity via animal and plant motifs, not human figures. #7 10,000 Jiandu In China\u2019s southwestern province of Yunnan,\nat the Hebosuo archeological site, more than 10,000 bamboo and wooden \u201cslips\u201d known\nas Jiandu were discovered. Jiandu represents a form of book created before\nthe invention of paper. The majority of the Jiandu found at the site\nare administrative and contain names of counties and people within the Yizhou Prefecture, established\nby Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty (although some do contain analects from Confucius). Official seals from 20 of the 24 counties\nruled by the ancient Dian kingdom, a non-Han culture known for agriculture and advanced\nmetalworking, which was annexed by Emperor Wu in 109 BCE were also found at the site. This indicates a well-designed social administrative\nsystem and suggests that special political roles were set up by the Han government. The discovery is now viewed as evidence of\nthis period of China as a unified country of multi-ethnic cultures. #6 3400-year-old pyramid in Kazakhstan In the Karagada region of Kazakhstan, a pyramid\nfrom the Begazy-Dandybai culture (from the last phase of the Andronovo period in the\nlate Bronze Age) was discovered. The excavation was conducted by archaeologists\nfrom Karaganda University atop a hill overlooking the Taldy River in the Shet district of Karaganda\nand revealed via carbon-14 analyses that the pyramids\u2019 construction dates to between\nthe 14th and 12th century BCE. Within the pyramid's burial chamber were found\ndecorated ceramic vessels, one with markings that could represent proto-writing, a bronze\nand gold-ringed arrowhead, and a skull. The people who lived here may be proto-Scythians\nor ancestors of the Turks. #5 New chambers in the Pyramid of Sahura at\nAbusir Egyptian and German archaeologists from the\nUniversity of W\u00fcrzburg have discovered eight previously undocumented storage rooms at the\npyramid of Sahura. Sahura was the second king of Egypt's Fifth\nDynasty, reigning in the 25th century BCE. The interior of the pyramid was so damaged\nthat in times past it was very difficult to explore it any further. But times have changed. The discovery was made during work on conservation\nand restoration, which involved a 3-D survey of the pyramid\u2019s corridors and chambers. During this survey, the team found a passage\nleading to at least eight damaged storerooms, with only traces of original walls and parts\nof the floor remaining. This discovery should help researchers learn\nmore about the structure of pyramids at this time and their development. #4 Roman forts in Syria and Iraq. Declassified Cold War-era U.S. spy satellite\nphotos recently revealed hundreds of previously unknown Roman-era forts in Iraq and Syria. The discovery challenges the previous belief\nthat these forts were primarily defensive structures. The images, which are from the Corona and\nHexagon satellite programs, show that they appear to have instead been built to protect\nroutes frequented by caravans and travelers. Now that we know where they are, it\u2019s just\na matter of excavating. #3 Hidden Structures in the Amazon Rainforest\nLidar mapping has recently revealed structures in the Amazon rainforest which include geoglyphs,\nponds, ditches, and wells that date back as far as 1500 years ago. 900 earthworks, and 24 ceremonial sites and\nfortified villages have been discovered so far, and these scans only covered 0.1% of\nthe Amazon! Researchers estimate there could be as many\nas 16,187 earthwork sites that remain to be discovered! The suggestion that the Amazon was an untouched\nforest is rapidly deteriorating. #2 Assyrian Administrative Building with Tablets In a combined Italian and Iraqi effort, two\ncultural layers of Assyrian settlements have been discovered in Ninevah, Iraq. The first belongs to the old Assyrian period,\ndated using an old mudbrick administrative building that spans the 20th to the 7th centuries\nBCE! Inside the building, 120 clay tablets covered\nin literary texts were found. These texts will help researchers understand\neven more about Assyrian culture, language, literature, administrative practices, and\ntheir way of life. The second layer belongs to the more modern\nperiod of Assyria and hints that there may be more to be discovered at the site. And now we get to #1! Near modern-day Tello in Southern Iraq is\nthe Sumerian site of Girsu, which was discovered in the 19th century, but the British Museum\nunder the guidance of the Iraqi State Board of Antiquities is undertaking new excavations\nthere. This year several amazing new finds were announced. In 2022, through the use of remote sensing\ntechnology, a complex of structures was identified under Tablet Hill on the site, and some mudbrick\nwalls, believed to be part of a palace were then uncovered and more than 200 cuneiform\ntablets. This year, the main sanctuary of the great\nSumerian god, Ningirsu was discovered. The temple is known from Sumerian texts. It was known as Eninnu and was revered as\none of the most important temples of Mesopotamia. Archaeologists have been wanting to find this\ntemple for a long time. And now they have! Also, a \"civilization-saving\" water channel\nwas discovered. The ancient water channel or \u201cwater flume\u201d\nwas designed to combat droughts by transporting water to distant agricultural areas using\nthe \u201cVenturi\u201d effect and predates similar Western technologies by thousands of years! (Western versions appeared in the 1800s). And there you have it. My top 20 picks for the best archaeological\nfinds of 2023. If you think I missed anything, let me know\nin the comment below.
