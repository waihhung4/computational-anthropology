"1927 Southeast Iraq during Advanced excavations at the ancient Mesopotamian city of er British archaeologist Leonard woolly discovers the remains of Queen puabi according to reports the queen is found with an unusually large skull similar to that possessed by some Egyptian pharaohs and mummies in Peru for many ancient astronaut theorists the Queen's skull provides further evidence of Mankind's extraterrestrial Origins the description of the queen was highly unusual a head that was huge she was not a normal human she may not have been full on anaki she could have been a hybrid there is an effort underway to try to get genetic analysis of the bones there are characteristics that elude to anunaki genes this is what the anunaki supposedly look like with these cone head type skulls so we would naturally think that she is one of the original anunaki or certainly uh extraterrestrial human hybrid what's of interest of Queen puabi is that she's a first dynasty Queen Andor Priestess so the fact that she's first dynasty means that she's very close to the reign of the anunaki this puts her in a very unique position because she really holds a key she might be the evidence to suggest whether or not the ancient anunaki were physically real and that's specifically the anunaki inter bread but if the unusual skulls found in Mesopotamia and elsewhere are really evidence of the anunaki Reign on Earth might the legends about them descending from the sky also be true and if so might the same be said for other legends that describe similar beings found in ancient texts all over the world Angels the flying serpents of Central America the star people of the Anasazi the notion that other worldly beings came to Earth from the heavens is one of the most common themes in ancient mythology and religion could the stories really have a basis in truth if we go back and look into ancient history we find stories that sound very very similar they're sort of all powerful magical Superior entities and they come from above when you go into mythology when you go into the star people Tales when you go into the Anunnaki it is the sameness the similarity around the planet that makes you say something has to be responsible for the same dreams the same mythology the same idea that life came from the stars all AC Ross the world we find stories of Otherworldly or extraterrestrial beings coming to Earth and influencing Humanity this raises a question are there different races of beings coming from the stars and influencing all these cultures or is it possible that in fact it's One race of beings the Anunnaki who influenced all of these cultures and they told the story of the same beings Mesopotamia means between rivers in Greek referring to the Tigers and Euphrates rivers in what is today known as Iraq there were four main Kingdoms in Mesopotamia Sumer was the oldest one followed by the kingdom of akad begun by Sargon I um after that you have Babylonia and Assyria and even though languages changed and people changed to some degree the culture that was established by the Aran really continued throughout the lifetime of Mesopotamia ancient Samaria in southern Mesopotamia is often cited as the most ancient civilization even the first civilization it goes back to oh approximately 3,000 to 4,000 BC and here we see writing in the form of canop form tablets on clay and on Stone the samarians were the ones who invented the kinfor writing system the word kinor means wedge-shaped it refers to a system of writing whereby scribes would take a wedge shaped stylus and impress signs on wet clay tablets those tablets could later be fired and hardened and preserve what was ever written on them deciphering these cifor tablets was next to impossible until a key discovery of thousands of tablets at an Assyrian Palace in March of 1843 this new abundance of copor inscriptions provided some of the first tangible evidence of an ancient Kingdom that had been believed to exist thousands of years ago a French scientist named Paul Emil B found this gigantic under underground area in Northern Iraq and corad opened up this incredible room filled with statues of gods and Kings all kinds of wonderful treasures and many written inscriptions all over the walls in the ancient Samaran kinea form within 10 years archaeologists had also discovered the ruin of the legendary saman capital city of er home of the biblical figure Abraham at the site scientists unearth the great ziggurat of er a step pyramid shaped structure that was the administrative center of the city as well as cifor tablets and tombs adorned in Gold so here they had found this legendary capital of the samans with its gold clad tombs and uniform tablets something that they thought was simply a myth until the actual discovery of it proving that it was indeed historical fact when we look at the ancient Sumerian civilization we attribute them with over 100 of the firsts for a modern society things like agriculture science medicine mathematics King ship laws courts judges schools literally all of this shows up in Sumerian times 6,000 years ago right out of the Stone Age according to mainstream researchers ER was sacked by their Waring neighbors the elamites nearly 2,000 years BC but some researchers believe the cifor texts reveal something much more than evid evidence of an ancient race they point to descriptions of a group of divine beings called the anunaki the so-called princely offspring of God who according to the samarians descended from the sky the religious system of Mesopotamia was polytheism which means that they worshiped hundreds of different gods both male and female often depicted in human form having personalities very much like people do and um these gods were arranged in a kind of political hierarchy that in many ways mimicked the political systems of Mesopotamia itself and what this means is that you had the high Gods uh the Heavenly gods and you also had lesser Gods who inhabited Earth and the underworld now according to the Samaran text the Heavenly Gods the Anunnaki were the Supreme deities the higher deities the anunaki are among the most mysterious and Powerful beings of myth and sacred tradition the samarians describe them as humanoid but non-physical Spirit beings who had the capability of morphing or phasing into human form they came to Earth on a special mission to bring wisdom and also to mine certain material from the Earth plane itself in uniform texts the anunaki are described in great detail including how they lived for hundreds of years they had tremendous knowledge and power uh over the entire world they knew everything they had knowledge of all of the sciences and arts where they got this knowledge and where they came from is a complete mystery to archaeologists and you have to ask yourself where they in fact extraterrestrials could the strange Gods described in the cfor texts really have existed and if so might they have been extraterrestrial beings ancient astronaut theorists believe the answer is a profound yes [Applause] [Music] Gale crater Mars August 6th 2012 the Curiosity lands on the Martian surface to evaluate the suitability of the planet for human exploration the one ton Rover will find signs of surface water a key element for sustaining life I think one of the very fascinating things from a biology point of view is let's say Mars for a period in its history was similar enough to Earth that life could start to evolve you could ask the question how far did it make it what happened historically on Mars when did it start to say lose an atmosphere when was it not able to sustain it anymore and we could learn a lot about the processes on Earth that were successful by I think comparing it to how far if at all did life get on Mars and where did it fail but is it possible as some ancient astronaut theorists believe that curiosity's mission may also reveal evidence that the mysterious beings known as the Anunnaki also once inhabited Mars Zachariah siten theorized that the Anunnaki were coming from uh this planet Nibiru and that Mars was a like a way station for them to come from nibu to Mars and then to Earth so you would think that if this is the case that on Mars we would find some kind of traces of this anoi civilization there are we going to find pyramids giant do hum huge constructions on Mars just like we have here on Earth I suspect we will if an extraterrestrial presence on Mars can be found might a global awareness of our own Anunnaki ancestry also be possible according to author and Samarian researcher Zachariah siten Nibiru the home of the anunaki is on an elliptical path that brings the planet into our orbit every 3,450 years and the next visit is projected to be in the year 2900 Zachariah wrote In the book of the end of days about some of the prophecy of the return next time the buau comes around there should be another appearance of Anunnaki some of the Anunnaki may be really excited and happy to see what developed and what we have become some may be upset that we've gone too far maybe we've overstepped our bounds they may pass judgment on us and it could be good or it could be bad the ancient Egyptians spoke of the duet which was basically the crossing between this and another world and NIU was the Samarian equivalent of that and and it is a real which exists both in this space but also somewhere else it is basically a bridge a territory whereby human beings can go from here in life on Earth to the realm of the Gods according to sion's interpretation of the Samaran texts niiro also played a major role in the cataclysmic creation of Earth and the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter if true might a similar change be in store the next time we come in contact with the Anunnaki human reunions with Anunnaki whenever they take place almost always result in the same thing the stimulation of human evolution the anunaki enter into human culture and Consciousness bringing wisdom knowledge and often technology so when we see a mass Return of the Anunnaki based upon the past we can expect that we will once again see new technology new wisdom and new ideas being seeded into human consciousness when we look at the story of the Anunnaki and their involvement in the Sumerian culture we have to understand that this is potentially a legacy of information and looking at Humanity's record to interpret where we really do come from there is one kind common denominator in all of these stories of extraterrestrials visiting us in a remote past and that is their promise of a return how can we prepare for this return of those extraterrestrials in the future it's very simple accept the idea that we are not alone in the universe number one and number two that they were here in the past they will return the future and that hey it's [Music] okay "
