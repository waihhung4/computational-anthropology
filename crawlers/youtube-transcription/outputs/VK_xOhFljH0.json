at aft ancientfaith.com so let's get started it's a bit difficult to know where to start when discussing the topic of transgenderism that is according to those who are proponents of transgenderism at the root of it is what is called gender dysphoria the sense that a person's sense of their own gender does not align with their physical sex today sadly this more and more frequently ends in the chemical and surgical process to alter their physical body that is to believe make it align with their sense of gender now to be clear from the outset I am not a physician I am not a psychologist and there are a host of issues to deal with in this matter ultimately we want to discuss this from an Orthodox Christian moral ethical and Theological perspective and that's why they're we're calling this show transgenderism and Orthodox anthropology as Orthodox Christians our world view must be informed by the truths revealed by God in Christ through the Holy Spirit so for us this is not a political issue but this is an issue that strikes at the very heart of what it means to be human now in order to frame the conversation with our guests tonight we need to look at some facts first for instance the issue of binary sex that is that there is male and female this issue has been co-opted by those who are kind of controlling the official social narrative they say that gender is simply your feelings as a male or female and that the idea of binary male or female is just a narrative of our oppressive patriarchal Western culture so they go on to say that gender is fluid or gender is a spectrum where today they're talking about uh gender being a even Beyond a spectrum that it is unlimited that you may be one or many I suppose of many possible genders and that may change over time now as of 2017 that's six years ago from the date of this program Facebook itself offered 70 different genders by which someone could self-identify they do this in support of the official quote-unquote social narrative even medical associations are speaking of your sex as being assigned gender at Birth as if it were something arbitrarily done by ignorant doctors and uncaring parents but the fact of the matter is while we do as Orthodox Christians recognize only two Sexes and two genders everyone agrees and this is just common sense that the feeling or the sense of gender is stronger in some and weaker in others in other words if you are a male your maleness may feel at times stronger or weaker and your sense of maleness may be stronger or weaker than other males that you may know however no matter your inner sense of maleness the truth is if you have a male body you are a male the issue of physically intersex people those who are born with clearly undefined sexual anatomy is a far far outlier and it really doesn't change the reality that greater than 99 of people according to the scientific literature are male or female but even those who do suffer from that malady want to live as male or female now does that mean gender dysphoria doesn't exist of course not in a world where many psychological maladies exist we acknowledge as Orthodox Christians that gender dysphoria can certainly be one of those maladies and that brings us to the second point the second thing we have to acknowledge is the pace at which transgenderism is being pushed and accepted by The Wider Society even the medical community and most notably in schools to our children by the media and the government it's absolutely shocking and alarming and no this isn't an okay Boomer moment for me frankly I'm barely a baby boomer my date of birth is at the very very tail end of the official year for Boomers thank you very much every one of good will and common sense acknowledges that the changes and the accommodations and laws and acceptable Norms that are being altered right now is incredibly Swift and should give us serious pause these changes that are spreading through our society are doing irreparable harm to our children to the rights of women and to the minds of otherwise reasonable people now if you want to learn more about this alarming subject after the program I would suggest two books the first is erupt irreversible damage the transgender craze seducing our daughters by Abigail schreier and the end of gender debunking the myths about sex and identity in our society by Deborah so s-o-h okay so there's a lot to talk about tonight and the question on our mind is why do we as Orthodox Christians think the way we do about sex and gender and what's wrong with the the transgender movement what are the biblical theological and anthropological principles that we must understand in order to answer directly to those who believe that transgenderism is ultimately simply an issue of compassion and even human rights so I'd like to welcome father Hermann Garrison he's a priest that Nativity of the Lord mission in Shreveport Louisiana he holds a bachelor's degree in sociology and is a 2020 graduate of Saint tikon Seminary additionally he serves a new Mission supported by the Shreveport Mission which when you think about it is amazing the Shreveport mission is a mission and they already have a spin-off Mission that's amazing and he lives there with his wife and children so we're going to get to know him father Herman welcome to ancient faith today live thank you for having me it's such a such an honor to be here uh this really is a full circle moment for me uh you know my journey to Orthodoxy was very much brought along by Kevin Allen show the show here um Kevin was a wonderful person for our family personally amazed memory be eternal uh but yeah this is this is a full circle moment for me well thank God and I do want to hear more about your journey to Orthodoxy I I would direct people if you want to hear the longer story go to the spirit of Saint tikons podcast where you were interviewed there but tell me a little bit about yourself your family and your conversion to Orthodox Christianity yeah so our conversion to Orthodox Christianity uh started about 13 14 years ago uh we were a young family just my oldest daughter was born at the time and we started to really or I actually me personally I was challenged by this notion of Sola scriptura and this was brought about by a family member who who really challenged me to think about scripture in a different way and and he challenged me by saying you know why do you know the things that you know and how do you know the people that taught you were trustworthy and uh you know that was a question that I had to to ask myself and and um he brought up the Septuagint and he said uh he said the Septuagint is this translation of the Bible that's been hidden for most people well of course you know I mean we we know we use it every day in the Orthodox church but uh it really got me thinking about you know how scripture came about translations of words and and you know why they're so important so I just I basically Googled the Septuagint it led me to a Wikipedia article about Eastern Orthodoxy uh I Googled that and up came ancient Faith radio and I began listening to Father Andrew Stephen damick's podcasts and ancient faith today uh father Thomas hopko all the wonderful podcasts on here and then um found in Orthodox pen pal online oh wow you really yeah which was it was actually I was I was active in in forums and and the Forum had a a religious section and I I typed in eastern Orthodoxy and there was nothing there so I started a thread and said has anyone heard of this easy Orthodox church and the first reply was this uh antiochian uh man who who said yes I'm I'm antiochian Orthodox what do you want to know and we started an email chain and and uh you know did that for about three months and uh you know was reading about it all the time late at night listening to podcasts and uh he he you know and I said I I think I I understand the Orthodox Faith now I've read all about it right right right right right very classic sort of Inquirer hubris there exactly um and he said no no now you have to go visit and so my wife and I made a made a plan to go visit and it was uh you know just a just felt the presence of the Holy Spirit there at that tiny little country Parish that's Father Michael a blessed memory like to call it and um yeah and so that that began my journey to the Orthodox Church uh subsequently it was also beginning my undergrad work as well in in sociology then thank God after I graduated from uh from that uh I was called to to Saint tikons and we spent three wonderful years there at Saint tikons um and and a a a time of many firsts we were the first all married class on Saint tikons wow oh wow so yeah so that was a really special uh special to to be able to um have that group of of Brothers uh go through through that together as as a married man and so it was a it was a very special special group and I love those guys um and then of course the first unfortunately the first virtual graduation in San Diego yeah as many of of our listeners have have experienced as well those must have been very difficult years to go through your schooling and you know have to do so much online Etc that's uh I also felt very sorry for new priests that just got put into a parish and all of a sudden you know we're dealing with a lot of stuff going on thankfully it was just my last semester uh when it uh when whenever all that that happened so I was able to get the vast majority of my Seminary experience uh incarnationally as Father John Parker uh likes to likes to say so that was that was a wonderful wonderful experience good all right uh so we're glad that you are with us and and uh partaking of the Orthodox faith and we wish you all the best down in your uh your new assignment and it's very very exciting down there just really amazing so let's turn to the topic of transgenderism and Orthodox anthropology uh the first question that I would ask you is why does this topic interest you so much it interests me so much because I am a product of a generation that perhaps has has experienced this the most sharply um you know I'm reminded of a quote by GK chesterson he wrote on certain modern writers in the institution of family he said they the moderns are seeking under every shape and form a world where there are no limitations that is a world where there are no outlines a world where there are no shapes there is nothing baser than that affinity they say they wish to be as strong as the universe but they really wish the whole universe to be as weak as themselves and I came across that quote as a young man and and well you know experiencing for the first time uh this this concept of you know what was formally sort of Science Fiction things like transhumanism right was was just sort of Pulp Fiction and um you know and as growing up as a fan of of Science Fiction uh to to start to see that to to start seeing that become kind of uh um in our society in you know our society was starting to point towards this our science um all these efforts were were pointed towards this this uh idea that you know we are sort of the the master of ourselves and um you know I began to experience that shapelessness as a young person and It produced so much anxiety in me uh wow because there was no you know my faith before coming to to the Orthodox Church was of course uh shaken and I talked about that in the podcast a little bit so I won't really go into that but you know I was seeing so many things that were sort of Solid Ground melting away and really were saying okay well you know where is this Solid Ground where is this this anchor um as as Things become you know fiction and half truths and um you know all the the you know sort of the fake news as we like to say you know yeah is becoming so much more prominent which was only just um supercharged by the social media uh I got into the internet very early uh internet and technology and computers they always fascinated me as a child and our family was one of the very early adopters of of the internet um and uh I had to describe the sound of a modem to my daughter the other day but um you know and so going along and growing up with the internet uh I have been sort of in my own life as as a case study of of sort of the the power of the internet obviously I've experienced it in a very positive way with shows like AFR and um and ancient faith today and so on and so forth but of course experiencing the negative of it especially with social media and um you know and so uh all of these things are getting supercharged by this technology and the science and so um you know and I was as I was working for a non-profit at the time that was working with children boys that had learning and behavioral disabilities and we were seeing a trend a very disturbing Trend happening amongst the the students that were um that were being referred to us and oh and again it was a lot of a lot of depression and anxiety and um and so I really wanted to just find out sort of where was this all coming from and um you know I initially started looking into Political Science and then quickly shifted to to Sociology because uh I was drawn to the field and trying to to have a macro view of society but also a micro you know I mean it's it you can sort of go to any stratosphere and and try to to give excellent explanations as to why these things happen and so this really led to my my curiosity on the subject and um yeah I did a did a deep dive so underground so let me just follow up to that you know in terms of use you said that you saw the the sort of the slide toward what was at one time the the themes of Science Fiction transhumanism and so forth you know and then you see Humanity you see Society literally sliding into this why do you think it is and and this is sort of the last question before we actually get into the meat of this issue why do you think it is that so many people are so willing to accept the idea that gender is so fluid that uh so many people you know anyone that says uh anything about their gender is is that we have to uh accept that that they were born in the wrong body and that the medical community has now accepted that we're going to chemically and and surgically change someone's body to quote unquote match their gender why do you think Society has become so amenable to such what only 10 20 years ago was such a bizarre idea well that's a great question um I think that if you look at the history of um sociology and especially I mean this this affects education systems it affects political systems it affects all kinds of areas of life you know you had such a Monumental shift in the 19th century you know of course you have you know durkheim and Weber and Marx and Hegel and you know all of these people sort of coming up with philosophies that are on the frontier of of you know I mean it's it's a new sort of philosophy driven by by science I think this this new um uh you know idea of you know man is sort of the the interesting this the center and and you know and even in science fiction this picks up right with um you have such a turning point with um Dr Frankenstein's monster you know the novel um it was so revolutionary that Mary Shelley actually had to release the book anonymously um and because it was so horrifying it was so horrifying to think about sort of experimentations with the body and and so on and so forth and then you know this all of these new thought Frontiers that are are are forming they start competing with each other and so you have people that are saying well you know we have sort of these structures and each structure and Society functions a particular way and we need these things to function uh in every society that you examine has a hierarchy and this hierarchy is necessary you know in this order and so on and so forth and then you have other philosophers that come along and say well no you know really uh the the egalitarian model is is the the highest ideal this this progress uh and then there there comes about this shift of what I think is we have this totally different idea about power so you know the the the late 1800s World War One basically marks the end of sort of the the the monarchy our understanding of of ancient power structures and there's this totally new world where power is um brought to to a you know a democracy democracy becomes sort of um and so people people are now have this power and they're saying well you know where does it come from what does it do what is it how has it been abused in the past and they start asking all of these questions and so I think that gets reduced down to uh you have several philosophers uh and social scientists in the in the 20th century that um try to try to give a you know very critical reading to everything every institution is sort of put on the table and seen to this this critical lens and so um so what happens is is of course um nothing is is is sort of sacred you know in the sense of everything is is we have to investigate this power on where it lies and and so on and so forth and and I will just say this as yes I don't want to um you know there are certainly some very good things that come from that you know obviously if if there are abuses or you know obviously there are uh and we talk about with with gender roles you know in the sense of um you know more fair and Equitable treatment for people uh in the sense of understanding the image and likeness of God that is in them you know um that that those are good things but what happens is that then you have somebody like me who grows up in an education system that has zero understanding or even language to sort of talk about a Christian anthropology and so you know as a young person I go through school and I'm sort of taught a you know if if you are growing up in the South you know I mean in in sort of uh in the in the in in more sort of conservative areas you know fundamentalism literalism of the scriptures you know they start pitting against science versus this versus the Bible and that sort of devolves into to a dead end and then uh then it gets sort of relegated to a like a wink like yeah you can you can believe in in the Bible but really the scientific fact is that that humans have evolved and that we're essentially reason endowed apes and so uh you know there there's no concept of a Telos other than you know whatever sort of uh as the Chesterton quote uh critiqued about the moderns and so there's there's just no language and so what that what happens is the gospel the scriptures get reduced to a social gospel to basically just just moralism and so I I open the scriptures and it teaches me how to be a a good person and and that's really what Society is now saying is starting to say is that well you know your book is fine your faith is fine you know teaches you not to to steal right it teaches you not to like you know love everybody right love everybody and then and then so what happens is that Jesus becomes the great moral teacher uh instead of the the Conqueror of death and the the sanctification of our of our human nature and so so there's no language for us to use and so as you sort of Go off into this ether this shapelessness that our society has then yeah it's no wonder there is no there's no Anchor Point there's no it's a free-for-all and um I think that that's that's where a lot of people myself included as we come to the Orthodox Church uh we are are taken aback we are awestruck we are like whoa this is Christians have been talking about this for 2 000 years right right that this is not something that's necessarily new to the church uh that she has been talking about human nature because that's the very thing that the evil one attacks uh from the outset is is Christ's humanity and so so father let's let's let's stop let's stop there because we're kind of bleeding into the next section um I want to remind our listeners we'd love to hear from you give us a call at 1-855 AF radio or send us a text message to 412-206-5012 we have an interesting discussion going on in the uh YouTube um uh Chat Place chat with chat space and a welcome to everybody there so we're kind of there was some comments about uh transhumanism them saying like well I thought the transhumanism was like you know implanting uh uh technology into humans to make them cyborgs or whatever and essentially what what I said if you don't mind me answering for you is that um it seems like transgenderism is that in a way the beginning of transhumanism of a greater transhumanism by using the the technology of the current medical understanding to change the human body in order to align to quote unquote the mind or or the feelings and so in that sense it's it's a kind of subset of of transhumanism but I think your point is really well taken that um the the emphasis that science somehow is is the determiner of the progress of our humanity is then uh you know transgenderism is turning to science and saying you see science can solve our problem whereas religion Orthodox Christianity cannot solve our problem and what we're saying is and and what you said here is that you know unfortunately people don't have the vocabulary anymore or the the philosophical theological framework uh in in order to process this particular question so what I'd like to do is we're going to go on a very quick break stay right there do not go away we're only going to go away for a few seconds we're going to have a quick break when we come back we're talking with Father Hermann Garrison we're going to talk now about if I want to explain to someone as an Orthodox Christian here's why we believe what we believe and and I will say this also this is where and I don't know if you agree with me father let me know this is where we as Orthodox Christians and I would say really all Christians kind of missed misstepped when the question of homosexual marriage came up we were left flat-footed because we did not have the the the arguments and the vocabulary in order to clearly articulate and make our case as to why this was not good for the country would you agree with that I would agree with that I think that yeah um yeah like I said I think that's that's where we're at now yes yeah I as I said I think because we have reduced the scriptures to just the Social Gospel or moralism right then it does become me just pitting my morals against yours you know and that's that's what sort of the competition is is well I don't believe in your Bible I don't believe in your these old outdated rules and regulations and that's all it really is and um yeah so I think that because we haven't really brought the language that's always been there but sort of the church has always had to bring it in a fresh context without generation exactly exactly all right so we don't want to find ourselves uh behind the eight ball here we want to actually be able to give ourselves the the reasons for the hope that is within us you are listening to ancient faith today and we will be right back Father Tom will be back in a moment in the meantime the lines are open at 855-237-2346 don't go away [Music] this is Father Stephen Freeman I'm happy to announce ancient Fates publication of my latest book face to face knowing god beyond our shame some Modern therapists have described shame as the master emotion one that colors and shapes our world in ways that we hardly imagine the Christian tradition is no stranger to this and has a rich understanding of the ways this part of our inner life shapes our experience of the world this book offers something of a road map to that inner life what is shame is it always bad does it have any useful purpose for us join me in an exploration of knowing god beyond our shame finding the true God whom the scriptures tell us did not turn his face from the spitting and the shame face to face is now available at store.ansientfaith.com that's store Dot ancientfaith.com we're back with ancient faith today and Father Tom Soroka give us a call at 855-237-2346 here once again is Father Tom welcome back to ancient faith today we're talking about transgenderism and Orthodox anthropology we're talking with our guest father Herman Garrison all right father let's do this let us talk about the framework how how would you begin making an argument for our understanding of the human person why there are two genders and why we should not uh be encouraging uh the this this spread of this social contagion of transgenderism yeah it's a it's a great question um you know whenever it comes to the framework that often we are presented with it's basically bodily and psychological these are sort of the two components that we are are sort of trained and brought up to to really only think about and so uh of course whenever we speak of these things as you mentioned in your your introduction the science can only really touch on the the psychological um and of course the the biological um as well which as you pointed out is is pretty clear but we're just presented with that framework and so when we come to the Orthodox Church uh we can oftentimes only be thinking about these two parts of ourselves and there is of course a sort of a a reverse gnosticism you know gnosticism being the sense of in the in the early church as she battled this Gnostic idea of of you know this secret knowledge that's only attainable through spiritual means and that the only thing that's holding us back is our our bodies you know matter is evil matter is bad our bodies are are to be discarded and um you know there's such a Negative view of the body and interestingly enough ironically that's still in place in in also worshiping the body as we do now and sort of neglecting the soul um we it still loses its true value and and and realizing as Saint John Damascus says the body and soul are inseparable for the person I mean they that is the person is is body and soul and so it's only helpful for us to to use it as as categories and discussion but we can't even really say that you know they're separated in the sense of um you know I am right I'm a body that contains a soul or right right in fleshed Soul but yeah or a you know a living being is soul and body yeah can we stop there just for a second because that this is really important point I love that you started there in other words when when we say as Orthodox Christians that we are Body and Soul we do not say that we are like a you know a a meat sack that has a soul we we are completely and totally integrated every cell of our body is integrated with this soul and our death I'll even maybe finish the thought our death is the disintegration of that soul and body precisely yeah the the Orthodox has a the Orthodox church has a holistic view of the person you know whereas the world presents a very dualistic View and I think that that is that is important to understand how these and again I use air quotes components you know of our personhood of Who We Are uh how they they interact together to make us who we are you know it's very interesting because whenever we of course go to to Genesis right and this is you know where we first see God made uh them in their their His Image and likeness male and female he made them and St John chrisism just puts it so beautifully in his homilies on Genesis and as he's expounding on this verse he says he first of all just points out there's a there's a full stop there there's a full stop there is God really wants to to emphasize this and I tell this to young people oftentimes because they do have this sort of mistrust of of Genesis because they've been taught or I've been taught my entire life that it's it's a nice story for me to believe in but it conflicts with actual science and you know in right real yeah real world but see John chrysosome says uh uh or not it might be Saint Gregory but they said but basically Genesis is the story hand written to you by god of what he wants to know what he wants you to know about your your personhood about what you are created for and so it is not it is not meant to be a science book it is not meant to be a history book even though it contains those two things the same basil and hexameron and you know all this he points out but the point is is that God is trying to tell us something very specific with this and he wants us to know this and so what Saint John christism says he says notice that God is speaking to them before they are created bodily and I think that that was that was very profound for me because God is speaking to this to Human Nature that biology aside you know biology aside that maleness and femaleness is something so much deeper than our biology so science can come up with all kinds of ridiculous ways to Tinker and and take things away and add things and modify and do all of these things but it doesn't change who we are it doesn't change who we are as a person and so Saint John christism says that it's we have to see this with spiritual eyes we have to see that that God created this in his will first of all so that he willed this and that that the mystery of of gender and it is a mystery I mean it's something that is deeper than sort of yeah just our body that's a good point right and that it is something that is prophetic prophetic in the sense of that God is is teaching us something deeper about this and we have to Humble ourselves and say Lord what are what are you wanting to teach us about this what are you wanting to pull us into this this fullness uh you know four and so uh he doesn't create this as as sort of a Plan B you know it's not like that God is saying that oh well yeah you know these these these two people are gonna mess up and they'll need a way to procreate so we'll need male and female no no he's he's saying this something that there's so much something deeper than this and so we have to understand that the the church has always seen the human person this body and soul and and has a noose which is you know heart we have a heart and that the heart the the center of the person um is Fallen and so this this heart that we have this noose that we have that's the fancy Greek word that seminarians are only allowed to use in their second year but you know but it's you know it's we we see it like what is that but you know I mean we could translate it as heart um that in the seat of that Center of that person you know is our reasoning faculty as well as our spiritual faculty our spiritual eyes and that that news that was that was created by God um is it's distorted and so it's no wonder that we see things about ourselves in this distorted view this is this is this you know this is Humanity 101 you know as we've always all right so so let's let's stop there because you're you're saying some really important things so the idea here is you're saying that when God created humans he created male and female this is the information that we get from the scriptures people that do not put their uh uh trust in God or in the scriptures will simply discount that even though they discount it at the experience of you know thousands and thousands and thousands of years of males and females right um but that you're saying that the church understands that we have um that that there can be distortions in our self-understanding of who we are as male or female correct yes yeah I mean and that is that of course is what Christ is uh you know what the Apostle Paul is referring to you know whenever he says uh when he does a call back to Genesis and says you know there is neither male or female and you know of course he says there's neither Greek or Jew slave nor free of course he's saying this in the context of uh the the abuse that had come about based on on people having this distorted understanding of of political power of you know of how people um exercise this power and and of course how you know um females women were treated in in ancient society and so this is of course revolutionary that Christ all of these things that were distorted that were broken that now it's healed in Christ it's not done away with as you know as many of the fathers saying Father Tom sopko has a lovely essay on this it's not done away with it's not annihilated um just as my humanness is not my body is not annihilated you know it it's transformed and so Saint John criticism talks about this on the body and the resurrection you know he says that corruptability is a virus that is foreign to us but is not who we are and so when we are when we die with Christ in the baptismal font and we are raised Anew that that that corruptability is trans you know is traded off for incorruptibility and he says that the human body is so imbued with grace that even the mere Shadow can heal somebody like that that's the power of the body that's I say the Orthodox Church is very body positive is extremely for sure extremely it's God himself takes a body right and so so this understanding of why this is important to us that we we don't uh our bodies are not our own first of all they're not for us to sort of just Tinker with and experiment and use in any way that we want and so this applies to all kinds of you know uh uh sexual things um you know it's certainly not specific to one particular um disorder uh we don't we don't you know we don't treat our body as if it's you know just something to be to be discarded or tinkered with and so we have to find the fullness of of what we were created for in Christ and that does include gender you know the the disparity is so as Saint John christison says the disorder that was created around gender at the fall is now put a right in Christ in the theotokos this is the prophetic role of these are this is how this this harmony is healed or this disharmony is healed in Christ in the theotokos and now we have those that physical body in the holy of holies and and excellent you know that's really important yes thank you very much so we have a caller that that just called in and then we have a question online from our YouTube page uh Dr garasimos welcome to ancient faith today you're talking with Father Herman Garrison hi Father Herman your blessing blessing the Lord be upon you uh you know I I've been a psychiatrist for 39 years I've been retired for two years in my entire career as a psychiatrist I never saw a single case of this so-called body dysphoria which wasn't resolved uh by the age of 17 or 18 years of age not a single one and as an orthodox retired Orthodox presbyter I can only say that my spiritual understanding of this all transgender and transhumanism movement is it's a massive demonic infiltration of our society it's not so much in Africa uh where I where I worked for many years but it certainly certainly has found its foundation here anyway that's all I wanted to contribute doctor before you go um I I just wanted to ask you and then I'll let father Herman uh respond um are you familiar with any of the literature that I talked about in earlier in the show uh for instance irreversible damage by Abigail schreier uh the end of gender by Deborah so because that that is affirming exactly what you're saying is that if we would just allow these children to to heal and to you know not push them into a a kind of a transgender movement they'll be fine you know to be to be uh transgendered means that you're going to have a lifespan which is half of the normal lifespan so if a normal lifespan is 80 years your your lifespan will be 40 years your suicide rate will be up as high as 77 I mean it's it's a Mark of Death it's a mark of Father Herman every manifestation it's evil thank you Doctor father Hermann yeah that's that's a great point I want to tease out two things there that he brought up which yes you're right I mean most uh most of these things are you know heal themselves by uh this this later teenage uh years and and um you know what we're seeing and what what the social sciences are are taking a look at is we are now just on the tip of the iceberg on the effects of social media and there's a I just read a study last week about you know this this theory positing that perhaps this gender dysphoria is sort of being fueled by the uh Community that's found in you know Tick Tock or you know whatever and that of course as as young people that's that's the very thing they crave is belonging and you know and what i t what I emphasize with young people and and this was my presentation at the youth summer camp last year um I cannot emphasize this enough and I have to remind myself of this you are not your thoughts right you are not your thoughts your thoughts because we have such a technology mindset a technological mindset we have trained ourselves to think of our brains as computers which is which is a a terrible model because the brain is is far from it I had a neurologist tell me he said we don't even know half of how the brain works and he he really disliked this computer model and so the idea is if a thought comes to me that it comes from within my hard drive like that's written on my DNA that's written on my hard drive right right we don't have the understanding of the logis me right which the Orthodox Church talks about that the evil one is constantly sending us thoughts for us to grab onto you know and um so we have to this is why confession is so important this is why being in a confessional relationship with the church and and bringing these struggles honestly to someone else you know there's so many things that we struggle with in private and when we get locked in our heads and I'm not talking about just transgenderism or body is dysmorphia or whatever this applies to so many of the passion every passion right if you if you are alone that's where the devil wants you he wants you alone and ashamed and we have to bring it before Christ and lay it to his feet and you know and so but to to his second point and I think that this is why we struggle as sort of just the average Orthodox Christian okay you know it's like okay here's father Herman you know he's got this whatever he's got this degree of course he got to sit around talk about it Seminary but you know the struggle that we're facing in our day-to-day lives is this idea of what we're hearing politicians say over and over again with with these you know with this pushback well you want you want to kill children I mean that's what they say I mean this is this is the claim that they make and so there was a there was a quote uh that I wanted to pull up by um a transgendered person uh who they were a a pastor he was a pastor who transitioned into a woman and so he gives a TED Talk and he talks about uh you know living as both a man and a woman and and sort of uh how that that is but um basically he says uh if you are in favor of this new policy this talking about removing the recognition of transgenderism and expect all of us to de-transition you really only have two options you're either you either have to confess your ignorance or you're going to have to accept that you want all of us to die so I mean that's that's basically the the sort of emotional burden that right we are often placed with because yup because it's our loved ones it is our our children and our children's friends and our brothers and our sisters and people that we love dearly and then we have this cacophony of voices that say why do you want that person dead because they're going you know that you're just you're promoting suicide and I think that that is that's such you know such emotional manipulation um and that's why I think Dr garasimos's uh uh point is is very well taken in other words the data shows that in fact they will uh die earlier they will die sooner the chances are if they undergo this uh Dr grossmos I want to ask you if you could hold my I'm if you're willing matisco Trudy is going to put you back on the line and she's going to ask for your contact information I'd like to reach out to you after the show would that be okay that would be fine all right thank you very much we really appreciate your call thanks for calling in all right father um we're we're about wrapped up here but I do want to uh bring out two comments that uh are are on the uh YouTube page one is from Tim and he says how would you respond to the argument that just as God created day and night that includes Dawn and dusk perhaps the male female binary may not be strictly either or um and then String Band mama says what about those who are born intersex intersex or eunuchs but I I explained her that eunuchs are those who do change their their genitalia so so two questions what about those who are born intersex and what about the idea that gender may not be strictly male or female because there's Dusk and Dawn and not just day and night you know what's interesting is that if we listen to and you brought this up in your opening statement which I thought was wonderful if we listen to the hymnology of the church it has so much to teach us and this idea and what's interesting is that how the the genders are meant to to heal each other and I remember being struck one day singing in choir and it was just a quiet vespers and there was a there was this this line about a female martyr having obtained manly virtue right and then a couple months later there was another line about um you know this this saint being sort of uh you know pregnant with the spirit or you know this poetic language that's being used and I think what happens is that what what we often fall into is that um we fail to see um as you pointed out that uh we're not saying that you have to be a caricature of what you know basically Hollywood has has sort of um uh given us or the ideas that we have um that actually we are to obtain each other's virtues you know those things that are strongest in in our genders in our you know in the sex that God has given us each one is imbued with with certain strengths that strengthens the other that calls the other and so um so I think that people really struggle with this the reason why they they're they're struggling is because they're like well you know I do I don't feel particularly you know sort of masculine or or feminine and uh and I have to think it in sort of these binary terms uh rather if we if we humble ourselves and say yes there are there are things that you know uh a woman has to teach me you know and uh my wife will attest to this you know uh that that she has to that she teaches me and so I you know the idea I think that the binary um yeah it's it's it's not as as sort of as not as character it's not a caricature that we that we think it is um but there I mean there are two God says male and female I mean this is these are the two right the two halves and and you know I think there was a there's a wonderful um uh quote by um uh you know Dr Timothy petitsus uh whenever he talks about on the ethics of of beauty you know and he says we have to have we have to have Unity uh to sh you know and diversity these these two things are without Unity there can be no diversity for on what common basis could we then establish differences itself while without diversity there can be no Unity for what would then be left to be unified and so God makes it this this binary um this he calls it a chiastic structure um for that particular reason um just go moving on to you know intersex people uh you know that is a from my research of what I've I've been able to gather again I'm not a I'm not a medical doctor um but you know there are of course just as in any Fallen you know in our fallen Humanity where we can be born with a a disability or a a shortcoming a you know in our bodies I mean my my middle daughter is disabled she was born with a disability and so oh my God and so she she was actually a brain cancer survivor she she lost half her brain um but because she operates with a you know a limited intelligence it still doesn't take away spiritual aspect of her you know I mean Saint John uh Saint Gregory talks about this in in the body and the resurrection he says you know you lose an arm you're not less of a person you know you're still a person my daughter because she has lost brain matter has a more limited intelligence but it has sharpened her spiritual eyes um and so I think people that have this this medical condition first of all my understanding is doctors will tell you that uh chromosomes their DNA still reads one particular gender yeah so their skeletal structure the pelvis will be either that of a male or a female you know because the the angle of a pelvis is different in a male and female so the the cells that that which reproduce in their bodies are are usually one sex and that it's it's usually limited to um you know a deformity in the genitalia so it's it's a category that again for an Orthodox Christian um is unfortunate I mean it's it's it's a sort of a sign of our fallenness but we've already established that our our male and femaleness is not dependent on our our bodies even you know that is something deeper than just our bodies and so um I think that for people that unfortunately uh are going through that um you know would definitely still identify as as either male or female yeah and the research seems to show that all right father uh any last remarks maybe um what would you say to especially young people that are um questioning uh they they don't feel that they are in the right body if you will and they're seeing uh you know famous actors and and influencers that are um you know that are making hundreds of thousands of dollars and maybe they could do that you know uh just by going through some kind of transition uh give me a couple of just a brief minute or two on what you would say to them let's say first turn off tick tock I mean I'm I'm being serious about that I'm not trying to be old man yelling at the clouds here but you know there's so much science that is supporting that it is bad for our our mental health and well-being and that goes for adults as well but um it's important to to get an incarnational Community right especially if we are if we are struggling with aspects of our Humanity we have to get into a real place in the realest place on Earth is in the church I mean that is that is that is the realest place that you will ever get right right and we have to get outside of ourselves because this is nothing new the world has always wanted your attention it wants to to use your body for its gain uh it does not want you to to live your full prophetic intention that God has for your life and so we have to find that out and sometimes that's a that's a great struggle uh I just believe me I know very well how much of a struggle that can be but if we stay in that Echo chamber of of uh you know of negativity of of you know we have to break out of that and get incarnational and and realize that um you know look to the people that have struggled that have gone before us because there are Saints who have struggled with this that you know I mean Saint Mary of Egypt is probably one of the greatest examples we have of a of a a saint who has struggled with you know the the view of the body and what the body is for and we can pray to her and say you know Saint Mary pray for me because you know my struggle you know what it's like to have a body that feels like an enemy to you because it it constantly drags you into sin and you feel like you have no control over it and so the Saints are there but most importantly Christ is there and we have to run to him he's the only sure anchor amen father Hermann thank you so much for your thoughts tonight that was really fascinating and very very helpful and obviously we do pray for people that are suffering with this to talk to their priests to talk to someone who is trusted get off social media get off uh these these absolutely toxic garbage Tick Tock that is that is uh uh putting these ideas into people's heads um and and turn it off read a book read a good book uh pray to God go to church and uh you know get these thoughts out of your head I think this is where it starts father Herman thank you so much best wishes to all of your uh uh your flock down there all the work that you're doing it's very very exciting and we have people come back and join us soon thank you I appreciate it thank you thank you before I share a few final thoughts they want to offer my sincere thanks to Father Herman Garrison for joining us tonight thanks to monster Trudy for engineering the program to our show production assistant Melissa Graf for her work behind the scenes for everybody that's listening in and for those who will be listening and to all you folks online good stuff going on especially on YouTube tonight all right two readings here real quick Genesis one it's an obvious one right the creation of man and woman it's where we get our truth so Adam gave names to all the cattle to the birds of the air to every beast of the field but Adam uh but for Adam there was not a helper found comparable to him and the Lord God caused the Deep Sleep to fall on Adam and he slept and he took one of his ribs and closed up the Flesh in its place then the rib which the Lord God had taken for man he made into a woman and he brought her to the man and Adam said this is now bone of my bones and Flesh of My Flesh she shall be called woman because she was taken out of man and then Ambrose of Milan Saint Ambrose says not without significance too is the fact that woman was made out of the rib of man she was not made of the same Earth with which he was formed in order that we might realize that the physical nature of both man man and woman is identical and that there was one source for the propagation of the human race for that reason neither was Man created together with a woman nor were there two men and two women created at the beginning but first a man and after that a woman God willed it that human nature be established as one thus from the very Inception of the human race he eliminated the possibility that many disparate Natures should arise and that's our show for tonight remember to like us on Facebook at facebook.com ancient
