"according to legend the first Chinese dynasty the SIA was founded by the survivors of a natural disaster shortly before two thousand BC the Yellow River burst its banks and caused terrible floods for a number of years leaving only a handful of survivors facing up to this deluge was one man immediately designated as a providential leader the founder of the first great oriental civilization you the great for a long time this fable enabled the Middle Kingdom authorities to legitimize their centralized power the SIA were therefore the common ancestors of all the Chinese people according to legend but in 2001 archaeologists discovered the remains of a city ravaged by the floods in 2000 BC the dates coincided the discovery of the victims bodies submerged in torrents of mud indicated that the legend was based on reality a simple question therefore had to be posed if the floods did in fact happen with the cioth themselves not have existed - in their pursuit of this legendary dynasty historians would delve back to the very sources of Chinese civilization rediscover the greatest of Neolithic cultures and solve a mystery some 4000 years old you to grasp the power of a nation we often have to explore its history China is no exception and has no end of fascinating secrets to reveal for the first time the Middle Kingdom is opening its doors for a journey back to the very roots of Chinese civilization a journey through 2,000 years of antiquity beyond legend to the discovery of greater dynasties of incomparable works of art and a flourishing civilizations that nevertheless died out and disappeared a journey to the heart of an unknown and secretive China a land of extraordinary colors heir to a multitude of cultural influences an odyssey to the sources of a great power born in antiquity the history of modern China is still being written despite or perhaps because of its cultural and linguistic diversity China seeks to assert its unity even at elementary school young pupils learn their lessons well Jimmy Anna dollar whose analemma interagency so you know sort of washes Amissah who wrote a fabulous Amin use y-yeah God ruin that oh don't worry don't worry I got it hold that the origin of the term of Garcia is unknown the name SIA was that of the first line of sovereigns who had settled along the Yellow River Valley at a time when China is increasingly imposing its Dominion this reference shows the authorities determination to route itself in the country's ancient history and yet the existence of the SIA has never been proved according to the records of the grand historian written in the first century BC by Sima chin there were three successive royal dynasties based in the middle reaches of the Yellow River Valley there were the co between 2000 and 1600 BC the Shang between 1600 and 1050 and the Jo between 1050 and 221 BC for traditional historians these three dynasties embody the civilized world formed in the cradle of Chinese civilization along the Yellow River archeological digs undertaken by the Chinese in the early 20th century confirm the existence of the Shang and Jo dynasties notably due to the discovery of early bronzes at around the same time Westerners - were looking into the history of the Middle Kingdom the Frenchmen eduaction translated Sima Chen's records of the grand historian a Chinese collector and antique dealer mr. Liu began to familiarize Westerners with Chinese art in 1920 he even built a pagoda in the middle of Paris more and more French archaeologists became interested in China particularly when excavations revealed a new treasure the first examples of writing ligature or seen about writing appeared in China around the middle of the 13th century BC so towards the end of the Shang Dynasty if you do luck when they affect Imam for this period we do have some written records that enable us in part to corroborate Semih Chen's chronicles concerning the Shang era de Xiang me / voted on the other hand before that period for the whole first part of the Shang Dynasty we have no writing and so we can only rely on archaeological remains with no written proof it is difficult to establish the existence of the seea dynasty a veritable missing link between the end of the Neolithic period and the following dynasties only the archaeological digs can help solve this mystery all the excavation campaigns were interrupted in 1937 occupied by the Japanese a large part of the country was in the midst of a brutal war archeology was not a priority the sites laid dormant until the People's Republic was founded in 1949 archeology became a state affair and was now run with a Marxist ideology dig work resumed and revealed new cultures sometimes quite far from the Yellow River but the Chinese Communists would for a long time remain skeptical about this diversity they believe China should be one and that Chinese civilization developed only in the central plains before conquering it's barbaric neighbors in 1995 the government launched a vast project to scientifically establish the chronology of ancient China and to confirm the existence of the SIA dynasty a woman you'll call call proving the existence of their Co dynasty notably through archaeological digs and research a legend constitutes in a sense the materialization of the Chinese people's aspirations to know more about their roots the town you go you go um well the project brings together eminent specialists in archeology botany and astronomy but it is not exempt from certain nationalist preconceptions to find the sia it is necessary to go back to the original sources and discover the legends recounted by Sima Qian a very long time ago the land was submerged beneath great floods try as they might the kings could not stem the flow of rivers running wild the people were living in appalling conditions one day a young man was chosen to attempt to control the flies he was called you as he put the well-being of his people above all else he tirelessly led his companions to every corner of the land to accomplish his mission and to try and stop the deluge of water during this formidable battle his young body grew weak and he became like an old man he could barely stand up any longer but despite the pain you continued his combat 13 years went by finally you managed to dominate the rivers and once the land had dried out again the people began to prosper with his companion support you became king he was the founder of the first dynasty Vysya you the great is the main character in numerous legends still very much alive in many Chinese regions the inhabitants of the village of long cease yang into such one province belong to one of China's 56 ethnic minorities the Chiang one of their shamanic dances has been passed down from one generation to the next since time immemorial he chuckled as illogical adachi loyal watch was Tolyatti tada the dancers hopped from one foot to the other the step is supposed to repel evil spirits and to bring prosperity the story goes that the choreography was created to pay homage to use the great whose legs became so weak as he battled against the torrential floods shadow do you know me we pass on the story of the sheer from one generation to the next use since the dawn of time every year we offer our most sincere prayers so that we are protected from disasters caused by floods black kibby's housing bubble the veneration for you the great goes far beyond the borders of Szechuan monumental statues of the master of the floods rise up throughout China on islands in the middle of rivers in parks or at crossroads they are all testament to the exploits of the founding father of the first dynasty and enable the Chinese to forge durable links to the extraordinary figure of the guardian of their history in the propaganda you the great is a reminder of their common ancestry the seea dynasty the scientists mission was clear to transform the legend into reality archaeological discoveries throughout the 20th century enabled several cultures from the end of the Neill of the period to be identified their development was closely linked to the great rivers that have shaped the Chinese landscape the Huang hey or Yellow River and the Yangtze in the centre of the country it was in the Yangtze Delta that an original culture developed between 3400 and 2250 BC the yangju it was one of the most powerful of the times as revealed in digs that began in 1936 janeshia donnelly this is the latest discovery in line to the city ramparts I'm standing in front of a very well preserved part of it as you can see the layers of Earth are clearly visible these are the first ramparts that date back to the yang to culture that have been found in the Yangtze Delta today - what's a padded county over several years the remains of this enormous construction some five thousand years old have emerged from the ground they demonstrate the power of a society from the new Stone Age professor bin of you is in charge of the excavation work and to shorten under the northern wall is the best preserved of the four walls in the enclosure these are the stone foundations Hong Willy and your de la detailed analysis of the ground and of these stones has revealed that they came from a mountain situated several kilometers from here four meters have been preserved but we think the wall was much higher cement we gambled by studying the type of constructional we've realized that it was built using traditional methods by hand for me Sumi dog ah the outer wall measured almost seven kilometres the tone would have covered some 750 acres the number of pottery pieces found on the site reveals the size of the local population and their daily activities the inhabitants lived from agriculture notably from rice growing as indicates the presence of carbon Aries grains found during excavations hundred hastily nju culture developed between three thousand four hundred and two thousand three hundred before a modern era a period that corresponded to the oldest Egyptian dynasties they'd formed and if we look at the size of it the town certainly holds its own compared to Egyptian towns at the time accurately on yogurt when sugar control on the site the archaeologists travel back in time they have deciphered the flourishing towns past one level has even provided some vital information Calendar Hornet I'm on the level where the inhabitants of Leon who lived there Andrew during the final days of the town floodwaters buried it all beneath mud and sand this strata corresponds precisely to that event you came human the lighter sedimentary layer is made up of silt it proves that several funds washed over the city it is known today that there were significant climate changes between 3000 and 2000 BC temperatures dropped and rainfall levels increased dramatically flooding caused the city and its treasures to be swallowed up in the graves of Liang Joo dignitaries archaeologists have found song ritual cylinders made from jade a semi-precious stone the presence of these objects in graves tells a scientist a good deal about the wealth and power of the yangju notables the precise function of that song is a mystery but their rarity suggests the Jade cylinders blonde only to an elite few the decoration is similar to what can be seen on Shang Dynasty bronze vases a thousand years later no Matteo now um kinda tear down room during prehistory Jade was first of all used decoratively a Jewish shoe but then around 3000 BC it began to be used by Nobles during rituals as an emblem of their authority she's defending a young lion the stone acquired a certain social standing aspect job Thor agree fool dirt or became a symbol of power of piety of the upper classes these for each year are 21 wash with you nama much later eminent characters such as Confucius gave Jade and even greater social significance what a shock wish wishing so during this process from being a simple stone with a magnificent gleam Jade became an object of worship for the shining an historic and political symbol other chakras machine the inhabitants of the autonomous sind Jiang region in the extreme west of the vast Chinese Republic still dig into the mountains looking for the stone whose popularity and value have never waned since antiquity these mines have supplied some of the finest je to be found the market is flourishing on sellers dolls prices of the finest pieces have increased a hundred times over the past ten years this is real coat on Jade how much is that worth it could be worth six thousand euros it's a profitable business if you can distinguish between a piece of jade and a simple pebble at the end of the Neolithic era this was the case the locals developed and perfected distribution networks and techniques for sculpting the very hard gemstone the Liang Zhu culture and body jade art at its height 2,000 years BC a highly stratified society developed in the Yangtze Delta dignitaries controlled a vast territory and no doubt presided over religious ceremonies but they could do nothing about natural disasters in 2250 BC the yangju culture disappeared and so it cannot be assimilated with the first dynasty to find the SIA we have to look elsewhere first identified by archaeologists in 1928 the longshan culture was based in northern China between 2500 and 1700 BC it occupied the Yellow River Valley in a region the Chinese still regard as the original cradle of their civilization the land that stretches as far as the eye can see is composed of Loess which has traveled far it is windblown sediment from the deserts of Central Asia in winter peasants try to stabilize the soils a civilization has never been so defined by the land which gave birth to it a land whose fertility enabled millet to be grown the main cereal in northern China in recent years important discoveries have been made at the Towser site the birthplace of the longshan Neolithic culture nine large tombs have revealed significant grave goods the dead were accompanied by coloured pottery artifacts their remains were decorated with pieces of jade archeologists have also unearthed some small bronze objects testifying to a burgeoning metal industry in ancient China excavations are still going on throughout the region in the past 50 years archaeologists have gathered tons of ceramics including both rare pieces and ordinary everyday pottery objects but their latest discovery was a major surprise for the scientific community so you dig up one closure we were a little surprised kinguin it was quite unexpected or even unthinkable at that point you noted that such an ancient culture had accomplished something like that what can we say apart from that it's really exceptional joy in 2003 professor news teams dug up a strange structure son archaeologists consider it to be the oldest observatory in the world it was built on the lower slope of a sacred mountain to the east towards the Rising Sun the architectural layout was composed of 14 pillars at least four meters high aligned in a semicircle around a very carefully defined central axis when the Sun rose from behind the mountain the light fanned out among the columns the direction of the rays and shadows varied according to the date and the season the structure was built according to the astronomical events that still determine our modern calendars equinoxes and solstices it is a solar observatory some 4,200 years old thanks to this calendar the longshan could determine the key periods in the farming year notably the dates for sowing the cereal that was essential to their survival in this region millet so you wonder joke way to walk [\u00a0__\u00a0] dirty Oliva the king was able to control his people by monopolizing all the information concerning the movements of heavenly bodies chay-ara Wahine you are mom if you didn't obey the king he could refuse to tell you when to plant your seeds or to harvest your crops yeah sure wit whoo yeah sure we don't man 31 so not only did he possess the means to starve the population but he also had a way to save them and to keep them under his control kini you wanna torture and yet the latest excavations have revealed that this power was francha the nobles had to face up to violent rebellions archaeologists have found skeletons that had been thrown into rubbish sheets some of the victims had been tortured the remains of a woman was found in a pit filled with cow and pig bones analysis of her teeth and bones has provided information about her diet she appears to have belonged to one of the wealthier classes of the population but this didn't stop her from being decapitated her attackers also stuck a cow horn into her abdomen perhaps attending war she was tortured before she was killed with her you know the colony must have undergone a revolt all the children named the people were able to rise up against their oppressors they probably took their revenge on the aristocracy by massacring this noble woman as well as other individuals of similar social status and then throwing their bodies into piles of waste after the 3rd millennium BC several ethnic groups which had developed along the Yellow River Valley and the Yangtze established contact these exchanges brought about technical improvements and cultural changes but neither the longshan culture nor the liang jew culture can be assimilated with the legendary sia dynasty in 1958 the remains of the new culture were found in early tow in Henan Province could this be the key to dig campaigns in 1973 and 1983 revealed a number of discoveries a short distance away from the present village and the river archaeologists found the remains of some imposing edifice --is made of wood and packed earth they were palaces tsunamis hi our visitors for the Father sent our founder sure taking a comfort in their the scale of the remains is unusual Neolithic cultures did not have such vast residences and the best was yet to come move move out of the way be careful take it easy there maybe to me it's alright don't worry a multitude of small pieces of turquoise form a strange figure it's a dragon one of the key symbols in Chinese culture this legendary animal embodied the authority of Chinese emperors up until the early 20th century modern-day Chinese still worship this allegorical image of power the dragon in early tow is the earliest example to have been found archeologists haven't been able to identify the function of this bronze plaque studded with turquoise representing the face of a monster with globulus eyes it was placed on the corpses chest next to a small bronze bell the same alloy was used to make one of the most important pieces found in early tow a short tripod vessel a shway nigel de milodon aesthetics around 2,000 BC a number of bronze objects were produced in China the early tole culture wasn't the first to smell bronze in fact at the end of the 3rd millennium BC there were a certain number of cultures which are regarded as Neolithic but which produced bronze objects a lot C D on that production we have only a few such objects and they're generally small and the difference we can see with the early tow culture is that in early tow they moved on to another level in the production of bronze and in particular they started to make Varzi de valsa this object is testimony to the early tow cultures level of sophistication but was this city the capital of the SIA dynasty one study demonstrates the power of the lords who ruled over early tow professor yo-yo Shimizu has traced the origin of the copper ore used with tin to make the bronze alloy the copper always contains small proportions of lead with quantities varying according to the place it was extracted even a four thousand years later analysis enables the provenance of the copper ore to be accurately determined the study shows which sites provided the ore for the early toh Smithies the furthest mine was situated in the Leonin province more than a thousand kilometers from our Tito Huey high an analysis of the leg could reveal whether early - only had regional power or if on the contrary the city possessed the power attributed to a dynasty such as the seer with influence over a much vaster area the fact that they brought in the lad from far away even from the Bohai gulf on the yellow sea shows that this people had been able to establish a system of alliances with other peoples you can add to us the influence and power of the early toe culture appears to have extended well beyond the city walls and yet one question remains unanswered how was the early toe sight able to prosper whereas other cultures in the late Neolithic era succumbed to natural disasters an environmental study campaign has been launched to answer this very question scientists carry out core sampling tests to examine the soil at depths between 1 and 3 metres they are looking for the residue of seeds some 4,000 years old the results of their analysis are surprising they find two principal varieties of millet one is called foxtail due to its characteristic clinical both types have been grown here for a long time but that's not all samples contain wheat seeds generally found further to the northwest in the upper Yellow River Valley as well as soya bean seeds selected from a wild variety finally the scientists are surprised to find rice seeds introduced too early toll from the Yangtze Delta much further south in most agricultural areas the population tends to grow a single cereal but the inhabitants of this region grow no fewer than five a polyculture that perhaps made a difference for example if a region is affected by a period of drought the peasants have foxtail millet which can put out with such conditions perfectly well if the land is flooded by persistent rains they can plant rice they always have something to harvest they're safe from all natural disasters only a society with a highly advanced agricultural system can resist climate change Buddha tada peasants in the village of early Towe still plant the five seeds used by their ancestors the land is exploited through a crop rotation system every summer certain wheat fields are flooded after the harvest to plant rice others are planted with soybean seeds in both cases the wheat stems stay in the soil to fertilize it thanks to such methods the Neolithic City was able to develop into one of the biggest urban areas of its time but what did the town look like the discovery of certain building foundations and ground surveys have enabled a reconstruction using CGI the whole town is much more structured than one might have imagined peasant shacks generally covered an area of only about seven square meters they form a village on the edge of the urban area not far away our building surrounded by fences these were the workshops where specialists melted the bronze unlike previous cultures production in early tow was on an extensive scale to the east a zone with the houses of the nobility in the center palaces and a temple dedicated to the ancestors of the royal line the ensemble was surrounded by colonnades and an outer wall it was a towns political and administrative center reserved for the king priests and the aristocracy archaeologists estimate that the town had a population of around 20,000 at the time one of the biggest in the world Sakina she dick triaging the architecture in china then was made of wood and practice for this reason the constructions are generally not well preserved but we can find traces of them in the ground the tea Haas the buildings were on terraces of compacted earth in which they stuck wooden posts to support the roof that's what your new b\u00e9chamel the Loess the fine sediment imported from Central Asia by the wind constitutes the basic material along with wood used in Chinese construction the peasants houses the King's palaces and the first fortified walls were only using louis sometimes mixed with clay packed and compressed the fine particles form a mass as solid as stone even today farmers in the north of China use the same method to build walls around their fields packed down within a wooden frame the Loess dries and hardens acquiring the same qualities as brick for the scientific team leader professor su the layout of the city provides valuable information about the political system that oversaw its day-to-day organization Indian so this is where the main palace was the archaeologists notes that the building has certain architectural characteristics that were unknown among other cultures during the Neolithic era the palace city was an enclosed area with a strict hierarchy the entrance is via a gate to the south the inner courtyard is surrounded by a covered gallery a huge building dominates the Esplanade for professor su the magnificence of the construction reflects the political power of the Monarchs who live there could they have been to cioth at Sima Qian mentions in his chronicles cultures honor re-poll from an archeological point of view it seems obvious that early told was the capital of the oldest Chinese dynasty in adiga and aha you could say that it was China's first real heart publisher a good number of experts are convinced that it was the capital of the sea a dynasty that we read about the young da well what up for them early toll means the Sierra Witter Charles Hall professor su believes that the plan and layout of the royal residence in our Leto could have influenced all the palaces built later he wants to check out his theory by visiting Japan it's the first time that scientists from Japan and China have worked together on the subject the meeting takes place at Kyoto University professor Okamura is an expert on late Neolithic cultures and particularly the early toh culture the two experts have examined the similarities between the main palace the foundations of which have been found in early tow and palaces from subsequent dynasties by me there's a covered gallery all the way around is that right doing shady that's right funky so that you're gone now okay this design integrating a covered gallery is really very similar to the type of construction we see in certain palaces later on in Chinese history jungle not easy there's really no difference with the plan that was still used in China up to the 20th century jig or toad or a more thorough study of the early taupe lands reveals that they served as the basis for every later construction in Beijing an aerial view of the Forbidden City built for the Ming Dynasty Emperor's confirms the hypothesis the main Palace is part of a walled enclosure with the doors opening to the south the plan of the building itself is similar to that in early tow a vast cover gallery surrounds the building whose facade looks over an Esplanade where the Emperor would walk the inhabitants of early toad therefore invented an architectural form that would last for four thousand years Kosciusko Luna a Vidya we have a very good example in early tow of the principle of the building which is organized around different inner courtyards we don't effective mass ejection so this is something we can see today and the most famous example is no doubt the Forbidden City me it was also that it should also be said that this is the traditional design for houses in the Peking area because it I detest all the houses were also built and organized around inner courtyard so quantity and only technical table so the techniques evolved and materials were used later that weren't present in early tow but the principles behind this organization can be found at the early toeside yeah sure Lucy druid there are no texts claiming that the inhabitants of early tow were the SIA that the ancient historians talked about but they clearly belong to a culture that was much more powerful than any of its predecessors the early tow peasants developed a prosperous agricultural system the metal workers imported or from distant regions to produce sophisticated bronze objects they transformed Chinese metallurgy into a specialized and highly codified art in early toh bronze already played an essential role in the expression of power and authority Fukuoka received a Solanki yeah on Philip oh we can see quite clearly is the link between the production of bronze and the importance that rights could have in early tow in particular for the elite because we have to remember that for a significant part of antiquity the bronze was above all linked with the elite and this is very important the production of bronze in early toh was mainly reserved for making bronze vases for use in a ritual context certain archaeologists even think that the Lords of our Leto could have invented the court rituals but what could they have been like until the early 20th century grand ceremonies enabled Emperor's to reinforce their links with their vassals by studying them archaeologists have imagined how ceremonies in the palace in early tow they have taken place at dawn nobles and certain Chiefs from surrounding villages are allowed to enter the palace grounds they are no doubt carrying a number of offerings and so as the faithful wait gather together on the Esplanade the king himself only appears at the last moment in his hand he has a Qiang blade a tablet sculpted from the purest Jade the jiang blades were sacred objects that the inhabitants of early doe probably borrowed from the mountain peoples in the western regions by adopting these symbols of devotion from other regions the kings would have reinforced their personal authority still facing the participants the King suddenly raises up an object that glistens like gold it is libation cup as way a vessel who shapes and forms have inspired other cultures finally a handful of aristocrats joined the king on the platform it is time to share the alcohol made from local cereals this exchange marks the hierarchy established in our little society it symbolizes the social and political framework that presides over the population of the town arty : I think the SIA dynasty put a certain emphasis on the relations between people lawn chair fundamentally I think divine power had less influence than the power of the sovereign leader downer obviously rituals took place to reinforce spirituality but instead of revering deities the faithful honored their ancestors other [\u00a0__\u00a0] this means that the SIA dynasty can sell itself more with many than with God suger the masala hello each spectator at the ceremony is aware of the sovereign superiority of his status at the summit of all worldly things the ritual also seems destined to strengthen the relations among the members of the community Artie told the be way yuneisia early told culture spread over an extremely vast area but I'm convinced that it wasn't the result of military domination but of a more gentle culture in fact of a cultural tower I read in essence the capital of the Cyr dynasty a littles was the first cultural center in the Far East the Chinese still visit the temple in the town of Chi phone to pay homage to youth the great legendary images blend into historical reality beyond the myth you the great represents the founding father of modern China but with no written testimony it's hard to say if the early tole culture can be assimilated with the SIA dynasty one thing is certain this culture is a missing link between the late Neolithic societies and the Shang and Jo dynasties 2,000 years before our modern era the kings of early tow invented a system of government and established a theory of authority and religion their power was materialized through bronze objects that became a mode of expression for the elite the early tol culture announced the emergence of civilization towards 1600 BC the shang dynasty established itself along the Yellow River it would take the art of bronze working to its height and develop writing used in divinatory rites in 10:45 BC the Joel replaced the shame they forged alliances with their neighbours and set up a feudal system obviously at this time China was not yet called China but the unification process was underway within the cradle of the central plains on the banks of the Yellow River and the Yangtze all the ingredients were brought together the history of a future great power could begin "
