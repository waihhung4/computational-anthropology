"35,000 years ago Europe looked extremely different\u00a0\nhow it does today. Virtually all of northern\u00a0\u00a0 Europe was covered in glaciers, huge beasts roamed\u00a0\nthe land from mammoths with four meter tusks,\u00a0\u00a0 to the shaggiest of shaggy rhinos, and prides\u00a0\nof cave-dwelling lions that stalked them both,\u00a0\u00a0 and as i'm sure you can guess it was bloody\u00a0\ncold too. About three to four thousand years\u00a0\u00a0 prior to this, colossal pieces of ice had broken\u00a0\naway from the arctic. Known as a heinrich event,\u00a0\u00a0 this dramatically cooled the climate.\u00a0\nForests shrank, step and tundra expanded.\u00a0\u00a0 Perhaps connected to this, the Neanderthals who\u00a0\nhad lived in Europe for hundreds of thousands of\u00a0\u00a0 years were by this point no more. They had been\u00a0\nreplaced or entirely assimilated into groups of\u00a0\u00a0 homo sapiens who had arrived in the continent\u00a0\nabout 10,000 years earlier. It's these early\u00a0\u00a0 groups of humans that i want to talk about today,\u00a0\nthese pioneers that spread across the landscape.\u00a0\u00a0 We know them as the Aurignation culture or\u00a0\nproto-Aurignacian culture after the Aurignac cave\u00a0\u00a0 in France where they were first discovered. Mon\u00a0\nDieu! Sacre blue! Forgive the French vibes today.\u00a0\u00a0 What can archaeology tell us about the lives\u00a0\nof these people who lived in a landscape so\u00a0\u00a0 unfamiliar to us who led a life so different to\u00a0\nours? i mean a Europe with no British tourists. Must be heaven, so peaceful! Before we get too deep into the weeds, it's\u00a0\nimportant to note that this Aurignacian\u00a0\u00a0 culture was almost certainly not the\u00a0\nvery first arrival of homo sapiens\u00a0\u00a0 into the continent. At Apadema cave in modern-day\u00a0\nGreece, a possible homo sapien cranium was found\u00a0\u00a0 and dates to an astonishingly old 210,000\u00a0\nyears ago. This skull may well represent\u00a0\u00a0 our species earliest attempts at migrating out of\u00a0\nAfrica. Another early example of humans entering\u00a0\u00a0 Europe was found at Bacho Kiro cave in Bulgaria,\u00a0\nwhich is possibly as old as 47 000 years ago\u00a0\u00a0 but belongs to a technological tradition called\u00a0\nthe Initial Upper Paleolithic not the Aurignacian.\u00a0\u00a0 The point is, humans may have been periodically\u00a0\ntinkering around the edges of the continent for a\u00a0\u00a0 long time but it seems that none of these earlier\u00a0\nexpansions were permanent. It wasn't until around\u00a0\u00a0 45 000 years ago that proto-Aurignacian groups\u00a0\nstart to appear in the archaeological record.\u00a0\u00a0 Just as i'm editing this absolute\u00a0\nemotional rollercoaster of a video\u00a0\u00a0 another paper is released talking about\u00a0\nthe arrival of Aurignacian people in Europe\u00a0\u00a0 and it basically pushes back the date of the\u00a0\narrival of Aurignacian people in Portugal in\u00a0\u00a0 the far west of Europe by 5,000 years. So keep\u00a0\nin mind when we're talking about pre-history,\u00a0\u00a0 things can change very quickly, at a lot of these\u00a0\nAurignacian sites umm there aren't human remains,\u00a0\u00a0 we're just going off tools. It can be kind of\u00a0\nhard to find those and interpret them. You know,\u00a0\u00a0 it's entirely possible that not only were other\u00a0\ntechno complexes, other cultures arriving in\u00a0\u00a0 Europe at a very early date like the Initial Upper\u00a0\nPaleolithic at Bacho Kiro cave, but that also the\u00a0\u00a0 Aurignacian might have arrived in Europe earlier\u00a0\nthan we currently realize. So things always change\u00a0\u00a0 i try my best to keep up but that's what\u00a0\nmakes archaeology so interesting, isn't it?\u00a0\u00a0 Back to the studio. As for where these Aurignacian\u00a0\npeople came from we're not 100% sure. They\u00a0\u00a0 probably expanded out from the Levant where we\u00a0\nfind similar tools dated to the same time period,\u00a0\u00a0 but it's also possible this culture developed in\u00a0\nwhat are now Iran's Zagros mountains. It's hard to\u00a0\u00a0 say for sure because we're linking sites based on\u00a0\nsimilarities in the stone tools that these people\u00a0\u00a0 left behind. Differences can be subtle and it's\u00a0\nhard to draw definitive conclusions, basically.\u00a0\u00a0 As for how many people lived in Europe during\u00a0\nthis time it's also very hard to say and again\u00a0\u00a0 is far from an exact science. One study of sites\u00a0\nin Western and Central Europe estimates there may\u00a0\u00a0 have only been around 1500 people spread across\u00a0\nthis vast area. These 1500 were highly mobile\u00a0\u00a0 though. Raw materials for stone tools were\u00a0\ntransported for several hundred kilometers.\u00a0\u00a0 Different groups would have been in contact\u00a0\nwith each other at least periodically. Perhaps\u00a0\u00a0 meeting at special times of year for friendship,\u00a0\nfeasting and of course fishing. The environment\u00a0\u00a0 that they'd have lived in would probably be much\u00a0\nmore similar to where i am today. Even though\u00a0\u00a0 this is the sort of high desert, not tundra.\u00a0\nEven though this is North America not Europe,\u00a0\u00a0 the landscape would have lacked a lot of tree\u00a0\ncover. It really would have been very dry,\u00a0\u00a0 very arid and features in the landscape like this,\u00a0\nriver valleys, valleys of all sorts, anything that\u00a0\u00a0 channeled game into one focused location would\u00a0\nhave been a very popular place to live for these\u00a0\u00a0 people who entirely depended upon hunting herds\u00a0\nof animals, following herds of animals. These\u00a0\u00a0 people that lived in it all year round would have\u00a0\nbeen intimately familiar with all the plants,\u00a0\u00a0 all the huge animals that roamed this\u00a0\nlandscape, every turn of the river,\u00a0\u00a0 every rock, well maybe not every\u00a0\nrock there's probably a lot of rocks.\u00a0\u00a0 But you get what i'm trying to say it\u00a0\nreally is hard for us in our modern\u00a0\u00a0 uh world to imagine how intimately familiar\u00a0\nthey were with just living out in nature. Incroyable! Petit Provence! Tools, tools, tools we have to mention them\u00a0\nbecause so often in prehistory is literally\u00a0\u00a0 all we have to go by. One of the tools that really\u00a0\ndefines this period of European history are these\u00a0\u00a0 small bladelets about five centimeters or so in\u00a0\nlength. Archaeologists believe they formed part of\u00a0\u00a0 composite weapons. This highly adaptable toolkit\u00a0\nwas a new invention at the time. These bladelets\u00a0\u00a0 really were cutting edge stuff, if you'll\u00a0\nforgive the pun, and is in contrast to the\u00a0\u00a0 levallois points which are common from earlier in\u00a0\nprehistory and from neanderthal sites. Speaking\u00a0\u00a0 of innovations, again one of the biggest\u00a0\ndifferences between humans and neanderthals\u00a0\u00a0 is the ubiquitous use of bone and antler tools.\u00a0\nNot that neanderthals never used them, but\u00a0\u00a0 for homo sapiens, for us humans, it was\u00a0\nan extremely common item. This actually\u00a0\u00a0 increased in frequency after the heinrich event\u00a0\nat 40,000 years ago which has led to a lot of\u00a0\u00a0 head scratching as to why. Were humans following\u00a0\nherds more? Did they find it easier to access bone\u00a0\u00a0 than flint? We don't have a good answer\u00a0\nto that question at the moment. Each part\u00a0\u00a0 of the animal was generally used for different\u00a0\npurposes. Antler, particularly reindeer antler,\u00a0\u00a0 was made into weapons. Points with a split base\u00a0\nfor hafting are common for the era. These points\u00a0\u00a0 are not thought to have been arrowheads though,\u00a0\nmore likely they were attached to throwing spears. Just as i'm about to release this video\u00a0\neveryone. Dr James Dilley here, an\u00a0\u00a0 absolute expert on prehistoric tools, maker of\u00a0\na brilliant youtube series called Knap time,\u00a0\u00a0 the founder of ancientcraft.co.uk\u00a0\nwhere you can find\u00a0\u00a0 beasts like this, like this mesolithic axe he made\u00a0\nfor me. At the most reasonable rate in town! Dr.\u00a0\u00a0 Dilley here had finished some uh research\u00a0\non these Aurignacian split base points and\u00a0\u00a0 he's willing to uh hop on and share his his\u00a0\nknowledge with us. So thank you very much for\u00a0\u00a0 that Dr. Dilley. [Dr.Dilley] That's quite alright.\u00a0\nI feel like this is going to be the uh viva exam\u00a0\u00a0 no two uh contextualize the Aurignacian for us,\u00a0\ntell us about your research.Be kind, Be kind. [Stefan] oh no this is it's super easy. I only\u00a0\nhave one question. It just strikes me as someone\u00a0\u00a0 who isn't uh familiar with prehistoric tools that\u00a0\nmaking something from antler would not be that\u00a0\u00a0 sharp and it would be quite a difficult weapon\u00a0\nto use and not as good as a stone tool perhaps. [Dr.Dilley] well that's exactly why the uh\u00a0\nphd thesis came to be. Why would you use\u00a0\u00a0 a piece of antler when during the Mousterian\u00a0\nbeforehand Neanderthals were using uh levallois\u00a0\u00a0 stone points and after the Aurignacian in the\u00a0\nGravettian they were using stone points again.\u00a0\u00a0 They do use osseous points again made of bone and\u00a0\nantler here and there but in your Aurignacian,\u00a0\u00a0 they like their antler points. To set the scene\u00a0\ni guess of the Aurignacian, my phd mainly focused\u00a0\u00a0 on North West Europe but looked at a much broader\u00a0\nlandscape as well because there isn't a great deal\u00a0\u00a0 of Aurignacian archaeology from the North West.\u00a0\nSo you know had to look at a broader picture of\u00a0\u00a0 things, but it would have been really cold.\u00a0\nWe think of central France today, certainly\u00a0\u00a0 Europeans think of central France uhh well i'll\u00a0\nnarrow that down a bit more, Brits think of\u00a0\u00a0 central France for a holiday destination thinking\u00a0\noh yeah nice, warm, wine, you know perfect. During the um Aurignacian the average July\u00a0\ntemperature would have been five degrees celsius.\u00a0\u00a0 So cold. In July! So, January, December, that\u00a0\nwould have been really cold. So it pretty much\u00a0\u00a0 would have been either boreal or arctic tundra,\u00a0\nlots of grassland very very few trees um and that\u00a0\u00a0 is the key really, few trees. If you've got very\u00a0\nfew trees um that can either be burnt, or used\u00a0\u00a0 for timber for shelters, or for spear shafts. You\u00a0\ncertainly wouldn't have had things like hazel or\u00a0\u00a0 ash that you think of those classic uh spear shaft\u00a0\nwood species, that are really nice and light,\u00a0\u00a0 they're flexible, perfect. Wouldn't have grown in\u00a0\nthose environments. It was too cold, there wasn't\u00a0\u00a0 a long enough growing season, wasn't enough soil,\u00a0\ntoo much permafrost, you wouldn't have got those\u00a0\u00a0 species. What you would have had is things like\u00a0\npine, larch and silver birch, that's about it\u00a0\u00a0 really. So, is there a connection between the\u00a0\nspearhead and the spear shaft? Why have antler?\u00a0\u00a0 Well let's look at the antler tips I suppose, and\u00a0\nfor those early Aurignacian spear tips they're not\u00a0\u00a0 just a simple spear tip that you fit into a notch\u00a0\nor a split in the wood. The split or notch is\u00a0\u00a0 actually in the point, it's a split based antler\u00a0\npoint and that's the interesting thing, because\u00a0\u00a0 you don't see anything like that apart from these\u00a0\nearly Aurignacian points. So the weakness changes\u00a0\u00a0 position because classically you'd have your spear\u00a0\nshaft with the notch to fit the stone point or the\u00a0\u00a0 antler point but in this case the split is in\u00a0\nthe spear tip, whereas the piece of wood your\u00a0\u00a0 shaft is just beveled. So the weakness is in the\u00a0\nspear tip and as they were hunting reindeer and\u00a0\u00a0 reindeer would be dropping their antlers, the\u00a0\nraw material is all around. But by changing\u00a0\u00a0 the split and actually putting the, what we would\u00a0\nconsider later as a socket like a socketed spear,\u00a0\u00a0 um is actually in the spear head so that the\u00a0\nspear shaft doesn't have that weakness. It's\u00a0\u00a0 got a much greater chance of not splitting,\u00a0\nnot breaking because it's the valuable part. [Stefan] hmm so really you think it's a technique\u00a0\nfor just preserving wood. Almost like you know\u00a0\u00a0 the point would split off in the\u00a0\nanimal and the spear would be\u00a0\u00a0 perfectly okay to use as another weapon as that\u00a0\nwas so hard to obtain as opposed to the antler. [Dr.Dilley] Yeah definitely. And you\u00a0\ncould use that in a variety of hunting\u00a0\u00a0 scenarios as well. You can either just be\u00a0\nthrowing these spears going for pot shots,\u00a0\u00a0 or if you're corralling reindeer into an\u00a0\nenclosure, you could just be ramming those points\u00a0\u00a0 in as deep as they go pulling the spear shaft\u00a0\nout the point is still in there and just easily\u00a0\u00a0 attaching another one going to hit another animal.\u00a0\nThere are various ways you can go about it. [Stefan] Well, i almost want to say a\u00a0\nsemi-automatic spear as a result of that. [Dr.Dilley] Lethal weapon. The suggestion,\u00a0\nthe margin for a fatal wound is, for a\u00a0\u00a0 large herbivores is around 20 centimeters or so um [Stefan] Quite deep. [Dr.Dilley] That's pretty deep i mean yeah that's\u00a0\u00a0 for for people who are still working\u00a0\nin imperial and that that's what. [Stefan] Don't even get me\u00a0\nstarted on that I live in America. [Dr. Dilley] Yeah it's eight inches, eight inches.\u00a0\nThat is a a really deep wound. The really weird\u00a0\u00a0 thing was that for a couple of the videos is\u00a0\nthat once the hammer had dropped, which was\u00a0\u00a0 the holding device um for these short spears\u00a0\nis that they punch through the ballistics gel\u00a0\u00a0 and quite frequently the hammer would then\u00a0\nbe drawn up for the next shot and the spear\u00a0\u00a0 shaft would still be in place, but the antler\u00a0\nspear tip was still wedged in the ballistics gel\u00a0\u00a0 and with that very tough split base point it was\u00a0\nkeeping the wound channel open like a splint.\u00a0\u00a0 So the blood loss would have been massively\u00a0\nincreased because you know if you put a\u00a0\u00a0 projectile um that's got a shaft in it\u00a0\nit would just plug the wound behind it.\u00a0\u00a0 Only when you know you pull it out that uh it\u00a0\nstarts to um cause uh blood loss trauma. But\u00a0\u00a0 if you've got this thing wedged deeply with it\u00a0\nsplinted open, hit a vital or you know graze\u00a0\u00a0 an artery or something you know this animal is\u00a0\ngoing to be going down in a matter of seconds. [Stefan] Fascinating stuff. You really have uh put\u00a0\nthe icing on my cake to this video. It couldn't\u00a0\u00a0 have been more perfectly timed. Everyone, as i\u00a0\nsaid should follow Dr. James Dilley on twitter,\u00a0\u00a0 visit his youtube channel and more importantly buy\u00a0\nthese brilliant replicas at ancientcraft.co.uk.\u00a0\u00a0 All of this information is going to be pinned\u00a0\ndown below and uh yeah thank you so much! [Dr. Dilley] That's quite alright. Ivory was most commonly used for decorative items\u00a0\nlike beads or incredibly detailed figurines,\u00a0\u00a0 which we'll come to later. Spoiler alert! The\u00a0\nart from this period is incroyable! Lastly,\u00a0\u00a0 bone was ordinarily used for more domestic\u00a0\ntools like needles. It's entirely possible\u00a0\u00a0 that these tools were simply picked for these\u00a0\njobs based on their fundamental physical\u00a0\u00a0 characteristics. Antler is the most resistant to\u00a0\nimpact so of course would make the best weapons. Now, I know everyone always laughs at\u00a0\narchaeologists for over-emphasizing ritual\u00a0\u00a0 buuuut we can't rule out that these choices\u00a0\nmay have had a symbolic aspect to them as well.\u00a0\u00a0 For example, was it significant to these\u00a0\nhunters that they were using antler which\u00a0\u00a0 reindeers use in combat as a weapon to\u00a0\nkill reindeer? It's certainly possible,\u00a0\u00a0 entirely possible. Humans are fantastic at\u00a0\ncreating symbolic connections like that. One tool that has generated more debate\u00a0\nthan others though are the enigmatic\u00a0\u00a0 perforated batons. The typical baton consists\u00a0\nof one sometimes two holes drilled through\u00a0\u00a0 an antler with edges and grooves often scratched\u00a0\nalong a shaft, sometimes around the hole as well.\u00a0\u00a0 They can also occasionally be richly decorated.\u00a0\nWhen they were first reported on in 1867,\u00a0\u00a0 it was believed they were some sort of badge\u00a0\nof office perhaps like a bishop's staff and\u00a0\u00a0 we're given the name batons de commandement but\u00a0\nthat interpretation has fallen out of favour.\u00a0\u00a0 To be perfectly honest we don't know what\u00a0\nthey were used for. Interpretations range\u00a0\u00a0 from spear straighteners to atlatls and loads\u00a0\nmore besides. But in researching this video i did\u00a0\u00a0 read a very interesting paper. The authors\u00a0\nof the paper analyzed perforated batons from\u00a0\u00a0 Gough's cave in Britain's Somerset and wondered\u00a0\nif the design features we see on perforated batons\u00a0\u00a0 are connected in some way to their use with ropes.\u00a0\nAs evidence for this they showed that the batons\u00a0\u00a0 have a lot of wear around the perforation,\u00a0\nlikely caused by an elongated object passing\u00a0\u00a0 through it. Double fractures on the antler suggest\u00a0\nthat they were put under substantial force,\u00a0\u00a0 probably much more force than could have been\u00a0\nsustained by holding it in the hand. It would\u00a0\u00a0 have just been yanked out of the hand before it\u00a0\nsnapped like that. And the bands of incisions\u00a0\u00a0 made along the shaft may have been connected\u00a0\nto the coiling of rope or improving the grip.\u00a0\u00a0 They hypothesized that it could have been used\u00a0\nas some form of peg perhaps to support shelters\u00a0\u00a0 or maybe suspend meat away from predators,\u00a0\nwho knows maybe even as part of a harness or\u00a0\u00a0 in some way like a sledge guide. As i said\u00a0\nwe we don't know what they were used for. If like me you're a wizard of the arts of\u00a0\nbushcraft, an absolute bushcraft master,\u00a0\u00a0 then you can probably think of a thousand\u00a0\nreasons why someone would want a peg and\u00a0\u00a0 rope. The possibilities are endless. Whatever it\u00a0\nwas used for it clearly was extremely important to\u00a0\u00a0 Paleolithic people in Europe because they're\u00a0\nfound at the start of the Upper Paleolithic\u00a0\u00a0 and the Aurignacian period all the way through\u00a0\nto the Mesolithic period, which is a span of\u00a0\u00a0 at least 15,000 years. Ummmm for me personally,\u00a0\nthat totally rules out any uh ritual significance\u00a0\u00a0 in this object. Not that they, they probably\u00a0\ndidn't have a clear separation of day-to-day\u00a0\u00a0 use and ritual use but the primary function\u00a0\nof this object could not have been ritual. No\u00a0\u00a0 ritual survives fifteen thousand years, except\u00a0\nthe ritual of bushcraft. Omelette Du Fromage! When we think of the ice age, we think of\u00a0\nmammoths. That's, that's the first animal\u00a0\u00a0 that springs to mind usually i'm sure. So, you\u00a0\nmight think that the Aurignacian people were\u00a0\u00a0 chomping on mammoth stakes every single night\u00a0\nbut evidence suggests that this was not the case.\u00a0\u00a0 In western and central Europe it seems\u00a0\nthat you would have had a diet that was\u00a0\u00a0 absolutely dominated by reindeer. Reindeer\u00a0\nmake up 91 to 99 of the faunal remains\u00a0\u00a0 in 17% of French Aurignacian sites. Sorry\u00a0\nRudolph but you were on the menu in a big\u00a0\u00a0 way, these early Europeans bloody loved\u00a0\neating you. What we don't know is why they\u00a0\u00a0 became such reindeer hunting specialists. On\u00a0\nthe one hand it could have been a deliberate\u00a0\u00a0 strategy to hunt an animal that lived in large\u00a0\nherds. You could probably kill many in one go\u00a0\u00a0 and they not only provided food of course\u00a0\nbut the materials needed for tools, clothing,\u00a0\u00a0 shelter batons du command. On the other hand, as\u00a0\nEurope lurched towards the last glacial maximum,\u00a0\u00a0 arctic environments were expanding and temperate\u00a0\nforests where animals like red deer lived,\u00a0\u00a0 they were receding. So reindeer might have just\u00a0\nbeen the most abundant animal for them to eat. Who\u00a0\u00a0 knows maybe a combination of both factors. As for\u00a0\neastern Europe the picture is a little different.\u00a0\u00a0 The Aurignacian is harder to pin down\u00a0\nonce we start heading further east,\u00a0\u00a0 especially once we start getting into Russia.\u00a0\nThe open landscape means that there are less\u00a0\u00a0 obvious natural shelters less caves and\u00a0\ntherefore we probably don't see people\u00a0\u00a0 returning to the exact same habitation spots\u00a0\nyear after year, generation after generation,\u00a0\u00a0 millennia after millennia, like we do in the\u00a0\nwest. Still there are sites in Crimea and also\u00a0\u00a0 20 sites dated to the upper Paleolithic that have\u00a0\nbeen found so far along the Don river. In contrast\u00a0\u00a0 to western europeans taste for reindeer, these\u00a0\nprehistoric people seem to have preferred horse.\u00a0\u00a0 Several sites show evidence for the mass\u00a0\nbutchering of entire bands of horses.\u00a0\u00a0 At kostenki 14, around 2,000 horse bones were\u00a0\nrecovered from a layer dated to between 34 and\u00a0\u00a0 32,000 years ago. This probably\u00a0\nrepresents 11 to 16 individual horses.\n \u00a0 Now, you know it, i know it, we all know it,\u00a0\npeople do like to be beside the seaside. So\u00a0\u00a0 what was life like at the coast? Short answer\u00a0\nis we don't know. I feel like i'm saying that\u00a0\u00a0 a lot in this video. But we don't know that\u00a0\nmuch because as you can tell from the map\u00a0\u00a0 sea levels have risen substantially since then.\u00a0\nIn a few locations though we do get a glimpse of\u00a0\u00a0 how life might have been. Mollusks may have made\u00a0\nup a significant part of people's diets. Probably\u00a0\u00a0 not too surprising, after all they are very\u00a0\neasy to collect, it doesn't require any fishing\u00a0\u00a0 ability. At El Cuco rock shelter in Cantabria,\u00a0\n860 shells were recovered most of them limpets.\u00a0\u00a0 We see this pattern repeated at other\u00a0\nAurignacian sites too. We don't have any\u00a0\u00a0 great evidence for hunting of sea mammals or\u00a0\nfish but at El Pendo cave, also in Cantabria,\u00a0\u00a0 one single sperm whale tooth was recovered from\u00a0\nAurignacian levels. There are no human marks on\u00a0\u00a0 it at all so it's difficult to say how it got\u00a0\nthere. Somebody could have just found it walking\u00a0\u00a0 along the beach and thought, \"by jove that's jolly\u00a0\ninteresting i'm gonna take it back to my cave\". If\u00a0\u00a0 we were to get a tad more speculative though, we\u00a0\nknow whales occasionally beach themselves and a\u00a0\u00a0 group of hunter-gatherers would i imagine not turn\u00a0\ndown such a bonanza. Who knows, fun to speculate\u00a0\u00a0 though. Despite their lack of evidence for\u00a0\nmammoths and rhinos and things being on the menu,\u00a0\u00a0 intriguingly they do make up a very large part\u00a0\nof the art from the time period. Sacre Blue! My words cannot do justice to the beauty\u00a0\nof the cave paintings at Chauvet, France.\u00a0\u00a0 Buried for 30,000 years due to the cave\u00a0\nentrance collapsing, this almost perfectly\u00a0\u00a0 preserved gallery of 420 individual motifs gives\u00a0\nus an unparalleled window into the world of these\u00a0\u00a0 Aurignacian people. There's really nothing else\u00a0\nlike it. Lions, deer, mammoths, rhinos, hyenas,\u00a0\u00a0 theirs was a wild world absolutely teeming with\u00a0\nmagnificent animals. At Chauvet the images are\u00a0\u00a0 made using three different colours. Red hematite,\u00a0\nwhite limestone and black charcoal. The charcoal\u00a0\u00a0 is the only one that can be directly dated and\u00a0\ngives us a range of between 39 and 33,000 years\u00a0\u00a0 old. The white images are made by simply removing\u00a0\nthe clay deposits that have built up on the wall\u00a0\u00a0 to reveal the white limestone underneath.\u00a0\nMy personal favourite is this little owl. [terrible owl impression] \"hoo hoo\" Sometimes whole walls are scratched clean of clay\u00a0\nto help the drawings of clay and hematite stand\u00a0\u00a0 out. The red hematite is the favourite colour for\u00a0\nhand prints and abstract shapes, though animals\u00a0\u00a0 are also painted in red. The hematite was applied\u00a0\nin a few different ways. Spat on using some sort\u00a0\u00a0 of pipe or maybe just their gob, drawn on with a\u00a0\nfinger, and intriguingly maybe even brushed on.\u00a0\u00a0 As you can see from a zoomed in section of this\u00a0\nrhino it looks like it was applied with a brush\u00a0\u00a0 of some sort it has those linear lines across it.\u00a0\nThe black charcoal images are probably the most\u00a0\u00a0 famous though. Not only are they just beautiful\u00a0\nillustrations of ice age animals but together\u00a0\u00a0 they form large dramatic hunting scenes, and\u00a0\nyou know we probably shouldn't be surprised at\u00a0\u00a0 all that the artists were so focused on\u00a0\ndepicting hunting. This was their life. [The Histocrat] \"if we believed the parietal\u00a0\ndepictions, cave lions, the largest predator\u00a0\u00a0 of the epoch, practiced coordinated hunts and\u00a0\nattacked large preys such as step bison and even\u00a0\u00a0 wooly rhinoceroses. This beast of prey must\u00a0\nhave been simultaneously feared and admired\u00a0\u00a0 by the humans who shared their territories.\u00a0\nIt is conceivable that this combination of\u00a0\u00a0 fear and admiration inspired in these artists,\u00a0\nthemselves hunters, a certain fascination and\u00a0\u00a0 that they symbolically stage themselves in\u00a0\nthese scenes in the form of these big cats\" A few hundred miles to the east lies the Swabian\u00a0\nJura mountain ranges of southern Germany.\u00a0\u00a0 Here we haven't found much cave art yet but\u00a0\ninstead intricately carved ivory figurines.\u00a0\u00a0 Lions, horses, water birds, the first venus\u00a0\nfigurine, a pendant, with a tiny mammoth,\u00a0\u00a0 even a little hedgehog. But more famous and more\u00a0\nincredible than all of these is definitely the\u00a0\u00a0 lion man. I should say lion human really. Many\u00a0\nwould argue that it's a guy but i don't think\u00a0\u00a0 that anyone can honestly say that it's not a\u00a0\nwoman. There's no identifiable zizi or zezette.\u00a0\u00a0 So i think it's fair to to leave its gender as an\u00a0\nopen question. Why was it made? Again impossible\u00a0\u00a0 to say for sure but a reasonable guess is that it\u00a0\nrepresents some sort of shaman maybe. Clearly the\u00a0\u00a0 Aurignacian people had a fascination and respect\u00a0\nof the lion. If they admired them as hunters, as\u00a0\u00a0 illustrated by Chauvet, It's entirely reasonable\u00a0\nto think some element of their religion or\u00a0\u00a0 spirituality revolved around the lion too. You can\u00a0\nso clearly imagine hunters sitting around a fire\u00a0\u00a0 trying to summon the spirit of a lion to\u00a0\nbring them good fortune in an upcoming hunt.\u00a0\u00a0 Or maybe even they feared them, maybe the lion was\u00a0\na vengeful god, maybe they were warding off the\u00a0\u00a0 lions. These cave lions were absolute beasts after\u00a0\nall, noticeably bigger than modern African lions.\u00a0\u00a0 No doubt these Aurignacian folks occasionally\u00a0\nbecame a meal for a pride of lions, especially if\u00a0\u00a0 European lions hunted at night like modern African\u00a0\nlions do. A lonely human out at night would be\u00a0\u00a0 easy prey indeed. Terrifying stuff! They must have\u00a0\nhad mythology and folklore around lions i can't\u00a0\u00a0 believe that they could not have. Ethnographically\u00a0\nwe can see that modern humans that live alongside\u00a0\u00a0 lions such as the Maasai of east Africa have\u00a0\ncomplicated and profound relationships with them. [The Histocrat again] \"the lion hunt, or\u00a0\nolomaiyo, on the other hand is also a social\u00a0\u00a0 cultural practice. A means to constantly\u00a0\nnegotiate the human lion relationship\u00a0\u00a0 that is accompanied with strong\u00a0\nand respectful sentiments\". The Maasai only feel this love and respect for\u00a0\nthe lion, hyenas and other predators are regarded\u00a0\u00a0 simply with disgust. Whatever rituals were being\u00a0\npracticed whatever they thought of lions we can\u00a0\u00a0 get an idea of the kind of music that the lion\u00a0\nman would have listened to. So far eight flutes\u00a0\u00a0 have been recovered from the Swabian Jura.\u00a0\nIncredible stuff! This is the reason for the\u00a0\u00a0 flutey vibes going on in today's video. This sort\u00a0\nof music may have been familiar to Aurignacian\u00a0\u00a0 people. It's incredible, i love it, we don't\u00a0\noften get such detailed glimpses into the\u00a0\u00a0 lives of prehistoric people especially\u00a0\nin the Paleolithic. It's incredible! Okay, quickly whilst i'm on the subject of\u00a0\nexpression. Obviously another way humans express\u00a0\u00a0 themselves is through their clothing. We all know\u00a0\nthat you can tell a lot about someone's class\u00a0\u00a0 or ethnicity or religion or how much\u00a0\nweed they smoked when they are a teenager\u00a0\u00a0 from how they dress and how they present\u00a0\nthemselves. So knowing that, can we look\u00a0\u00a0 for patterns in jewellery of Aurignacian people\u00a0\nto get a sense of how they divided themselves\u00a0\u00a0 ethnically and maybe even linguistically?\u00a0\nWell the answer to that is a resounding maybe. Marian Vanhaeren and Francesco d'Errico, whose\u00a0\nnames are probably pronounced very differently\u00a0\u00a0 to that, analyzed the different bead types\u00a0\nfound at 98 different Aurignacian sites\u00a0\u00a0 spanning the continent. They believe that they\u00a0\nhave identified three distinct groups of people.\u00a0\u00a0 Groups at either end of Europe do not use\u00a0\nthe same animal teeth and bones to produce\u00a0\u00a0 jewellery but both groups share overlap with\u00a0\nthose in between. This is despite the fact\u00a0\u00a0 that sites span the same time frames and\u00a0\nhad the same animals available to them.\u00a0\u00a0 It's sort of hard to explain so let me give you an\u00a0\nexample. Fox teeth were used as beads in Germany,\u00a0\u00a0 Belgium and south west France but not in Italy,\u00a0\nGreece, Spain or Austria. Despite the fact that\u00a0\u00a0 foxes lived in all of these environments.\u00a0\nTherefore, to use or not use fox teeth as\u00a0\u00a0 decoration was a deliberate choice that may\u00a0\nillustrate different ethnic or linguistic groups. Is this study of jewellery an exact science?\u00a0\nDefinitely not, and no one is saying it is either,\u00a0\u00a0 but when we're looking so far into the past\u00a0\n35,000 years into the past, we have to get a\u00a0\u00a0 little creative. Humans differentiate themselves\u00a0\nby the clothes that they wear, by the jewellery\u00a0\u00a0 that they wear and we can see a pattern in\u00a0\nthe jewellery from the Aurignacian period.\u00a0\u00a0 At least three groups. Umm but probably their idea\u00a0\nof ethnicity was much more complicated than that,\u00a0\u00a0 probably they had much more than three groups in\u00a0\ntheir sort of ideas, their conceptualization. You\u00a0\u00a0 know you could look at me, how i'm dressed\u00a0\ntoday, i look like a typical American but i\u00a0\u00a0 certainly don't consider myself one. Likewise,\u00a0\nan Irish person would leave behind a similar\u00a0\u00a0 material culture to me, similar clothing, similar\u00a0\njewellery, similar bourbon biscuits but they\u00a0\u00a0 probably do not consider themselves ethnically the\u00a0\nsame as me either. So this is really complicated\u00a0\u00a0 it's not an exact science but it's the best\u00a0\nwe can do without being able to ask them. Unfortunately life isn't all reindeer\u00a0\nburgers and flute solos. At some point\u00a0\u00a0 these people must have come into conflict with\u00a0\neach other. We don't have much evidence of it,\u00a0\u00a0 the population being so small and spread out\u00a0\ndoes not leave archaeologists much to go with\u00a0\u00a0 and probably resulted in less conflict than\u00a0\nlater periods like the neolithic. The only\u00a0\u00a0 example i could find from the Aurignacian period\u00a0\ncomes from Cioclovina in Romania. This individual\u00a0\u00a0 most likely received two blows to the head with\u00a0\na club from a left-handed individual. Merde! Another stumbling block to our understanding is\u00a0\nthat Aurignacian people seemingly did not practice\u00a0\u00a0 burial. From 33,000 years ago, during the\u00a0\nGravettian period, burial becomes a lot\u00a0\u00a0 more common and we have all sorts of incredible\u00a0\nevidence associated with that culture. During the\u00a0\u00a0 Aurignacian though between 45 and 33,000 years ago\u00a0\nwe have none. Whatever happened to you, however\u00a0\u00a0 you died, it seems your friends and family would\u00a0\nhave disposed of you in a way that has left little\u00a0\u00a0 archaeological trace. Presumably excarnation was\u00a0\npracticed, your body would have been placed on the\u00a0\u00a0 steppe to be eaten by a lion perhaps, who knows,\u00a0\nyour journey to becoming a lion man completed Now many of you might be thinking, why did i\u00a0\nchoose to present these Aurignacian people as\u00a0\u00a0 having dark skin and how do you, if you are\u00a0\na European, relate to them? Well the answer\u00a0\u00a0 to both those questions lie within our dna. I\u00a0\nam not even close to being an expert in that or\u00a0\u00a0 being able to present that information\u00a0\nin a good way. Fortunately for us a real\u00a0\u00a0 expert an expert who has actually studied the\u00a0\ngenetics of ice age europeans, Dr. Cosimo Posth,\u00a0\u00a0 was willing to hop on the channel and share\u00a0\nhis expertise with us, so that video is\u00a0\u00a0 released the same time as this one should be\u00a0\nin the pinned comment, in the description,\u00a0\u00a0 you know where to look for these things. Mon Dieu! Well that's the end of the video. I\u00a0\nhope you learned a little bit about the\u00a0\u00a0 lives of our french named, lion loving,\u00a0\nflute playing, reindeer eating, ancestors.\u00a0\u00a0 In honour of them i would uh like to play a\u00a0\nlittle tune for the outro, a little song i wrote.\u00a0\u00a0 Thanks for watching, thanks to my\u00a0\npatrons for the support as always! let's start that again oh that was [ __ ] awful "
