"[Music] [Music] this is the history of the world podcast with me chris haslam and this is volume 2 the ancient world episode 29 Neolithic China now it is time to turn our attention to the fourth River system Society of the ancient world we've described Mesopotamia the Nile Valley the Indus Valley and now we move over to China let's clarify what we already know about Neolithic China we know pottery emerged very early in China and the cultivation of rice may not have been long after all so we know that the Chinese societies were independently domesticating pigs yak buffalo and jungle fowl evidence of millet cultivation soon followed by and large these societies were settling around the yellow and Yangtze rivers it's time to look at the next stage of China's history and bring it up to date with the rest of the areas in the podcast initially we are going to target the Yangtze River and explore what was happening around there we are going to go right back to 5500 BCE this might sound like a long time ago when compared to our other ancient world stories but when it comes to China it is very important that we appreciate that a lot of the cultural emergencies that were about to start have evolved into the China that we know today we picked up on this during the episodes about the story of writing where we believe that the earliest Chinese writings are a direct ancestor to modern Chinese writing China is astonishing for this reason its culture has survived even though the power has shifted and we can't say that about our other ancient River societies whose cultures have had to have been interpreted without any modern clothes hemudu back in 1973 an ancient site was discovered that would open a doorway into the past when it came to the story of China it has been called hemudu and has become the name of the culture of the region it was a pivotal moment for the story of China and its history due to the fact that it was believed that the first civilized cultures emerged around the Yellow River and not the Yangtze River which was the river of hema dude the Yangtze River was more tropical in climate seven and a half thousand years ago than it is today and it was an area of high fertility and plant growth attracts animals and water plants and animals attract humans who began to coalesce around the banks of the Yangtze River and the lens at the NC Delta so it stands to reason that this river was just as important if not more important than the Yellow River further to its north the excavations at Hema do demonstrate a lot about the lifestyle of the people who lived there we know that the people of the hemudu culture were navigating the river and the coast in all powered boats we also know that they were cultivating rights as we can find remnants among the potsherds artifacts such as jewelry items and tools were being created using stone wood phone and Jade with Jade being a bright green mineral which was closely associated with Chinese cultures we can also find clues relating to the hemudu diet with the discovery of hunting methods such as arrowheads and harpoons regular flooding of the Yangtze River would have provided good fertile lands for agriculture and remains of wolf deer and Buffalo demonstrated a mixture of hunting and domesticated livestock various fruits were gathered such as kiwi melon and peaches the Chinese cultures may have been the most innovative when it came to ceramics with a long history of creating clay pots something which took thousands of years to emerge in the Near East and Egypt the hemudu pots were very distinctive for their charcoal colored black appearance Majeure roughly speaking the hemudu culture emerged on the southern banks and the coastal lands of the Yangtze River to the north of the river another culture was emerging at around 5000 BCE the culture is called the major bank culture named after the site of major bank cultural distinctions between the major bank and hemudu are still argued to this day so let's look at the major bank culture more closely in some early cultures of China the status of rice in terms of its importance to any given culture can be questioned with some scholars stating that millet was the staple crop and rice was a secondary crop more commonly used in the production of alcohol for example however the paddy fields excavated in conjunction with the major bank culture demonstrate that rice was a very serious production of this region and culture by and large many aspects of the major bank culture are similar to those of the hemudu culture excavations demonstrate an agricultural lifestyle with domestication including hunting and gathering as well as fishing in the river there seems to be little evidence of conflict both the major bang and the hemudu cultures appear to have coexisted throughout the 5th millennium BCE and well into the 4th millennium BCE advances in technologies and lifestyles are evident for example the major bank would start creating materials using the rib stitch technique which is a complex method when compared to standard weaving by taking a wider view of civilization and looking at the advances of both cultures we can determine that advanced methods of architecture emerged in areas of the Hema do with houses being built on staked Ridge poles which would enable a higher foundation to be built and is still something seen in the less affluent areas of China today other cultures Neolithic China is not unlike nearly thick Mesopotamia where various cultures were emerging in various areas of the river valleys some of you may remember back in episode 21 which was the first episode of the two that were published about the story of rioting that we mentioned some developments in China let's go back and remind ourselves about what we learned we spoke of activity at a site called Yahoo which was important due to the discovery of inscribed symbols on tortoise shells which may have represented an early form of writing society @j who may have emerged as much as 2,000 years earlier than the Yangtze River societies of hemudu and major bang J who is considered to be part of the wider Paley gang culture which emerged around the Yellow River in around 7000 BCE the Yellow River is further north over 500 miles away from the NC river and the Paley gang were certainly agricultural and they were also known for their pottery which is something that took a lot more time to emerge in other Neolithic cultures the Paley gang culture lasted until around 5000 BCE and it is possibly flooding that caused the sites to be abandoned further up the Yellow River around 500 miles inland from the mouth of the river we discovered the site of banpo we mentioned bamboo as another Chinese site where we find inscribed symbols that could be a form of early writing but bamboo is so much more than this as it is the type site of a very significant Neolithic culture of China called the yang shell culture Yong shell culture we shouldn't be too surprised to find evidence of pottery kilns at banpo the Chinese were not the only people to be using ceramics but we certainly think that they were the earliest experts are creating ceramic vessels even now being thought to be the influence on the successful and well-known Jomon pottery of early Japan the pottery of the yangshao culture is worth talking about it is notable for its decoration with many different designs and illustrations using multiple colors on different coloured clays the illustrations were unsurprisingly depictions of humans animals mysterious and possibly mythological creatures and female genitals there is absolutely no doubt that we have many connections here with contemporary cultures of the world and with older prehistoric cultures human beings seem to have a natural fascination and inquisitiveness when it comes to the nature of the living world itself including the wonder of the human females ability to procreate and the natural imagination of humans with the elaboration of real animals and aspects of their physical form being stretched and molded into something different maybe even spiritual and shamanic the pots were created by stacking rolls of clay on top of one another and then smoothing the surfaces which was a method which predated the invention of the Potters we'll another interesting observation is the fact that very young infants were actually buried in ceramic vessels unlike older children and adults so we can also get an insight into the yang Shale burial culture there is evidence of secondary burial which is the practice of laying the dead to rest in temporary graves to allow the body to decompose to a stage where the remains can be exhumed and in the case of Yang Schell burials the bones cleaned before a reburial the nature of the graves could differ with some graves being lined before the placement of the body or sometimes bodies as some secondary graves could be the final resting place for more than one body we also say the prehistoric human tradition of the placement of grave goods it seems that human nature around the world is to believe in some kind of afterlife which may be the general way the humans can make sense of the circle of life and their own mortality this also points us in the direction of another important prehistoric human development of the stratification of large societies grave Goods would differ and demonstrate a difference in the importance of individuals cemeteries were apparently quite general with a mixture of the amount of grave Goods found in individual graves with a lack of written support to explain the reasons for all of this we have to take guesses and this is where we can all join in and offer our opinions a beautiful thing about the study of history the fact that we see large amounts of grave Goods in the graves of some children in my mind points towards an elite class whose wealth and status followed a family line some experts believe that the Yangzhou Society may have started as a matrilineal society and turned into a patrilineal society buildings show evidence of being constructed using the rammed earth method which is a method of compacting earth materials into a framework and allowing it to set in place before removing the framework so different from the mud brick constructions of many other societies of a similar age another interesting aspect of the culture relates to a subject that we mentioned earlier is with the creation and use of textiles we mentioned the impressive and advanced rib stitch weaving technique of major Bank the yang shell would have been using hemp to create textile and clothing and to a lesser degree they may have been using silk hemp was cultivated while silk was cultivated from an animal called Bombyx mori which is more commonly known as the domestic silkworm the domestic silkworms create silk while pupating and this silk can be used to create desirable material silk is highly desirable it is good to look at it feels good to the touch and it is comfortable to wear although we do know that there appeared to be a trade link between the Indus Valley Civilisation of the third millennium BCE and Chinese cultures as evidenced by the discovery of jade in the Indus Valley silk would ultimately give its name to the Silk Road which is the healthy emergence of a trade link between East and West which emerged around 2,000 years ago however a trade link between East and West existed long before this with the Indus Valley Civilisation been a link between the two and silk was just one of the products that attracted Western merchants as spice was highly sought after - just as one example the yangshao culture lasted until 3000 BCE when it appears to have modernized into something else so rather than there being a suggested disappearance due to invasion or climatic reasons it appears to have been supplanted by something distinct and this has been called the long shank culture long chain culture the longshan culture is considered to be a progression in culture and this is something that distinguishes China from other cultures in the fact that cultures appear to develop from existing ones rather than be forcibly replaced the alternative ninth of the long Shang culture is the black pottery culture as we know black pottery was not a new thing with the hemudu culture known to produce charcoal colored clay this differs from their contemporaries the major bang and the yang shell who appeared to produce more red clay items however when the long shank culture emerged it appears that it expanded from the lens of the yang shelke into the lens of the major bang and perhaps into the hemudu so it was possible that the long shank culture took the art of black pottery from the hemudu who had been replaced alongside the major bang and the yang shell by 3,000 BCE in fact it is worth mentioning the displacement of the hemudu culture due to the fact that DNA evidence suggests that there was a migration of people's after the hemudu culture dispersed in around 3,000 BCE it is possible that a contingent initially migrated onto the island of Taiwan before migrating over the course of the next few thousand years to the islands of Southeast Asia and then on to the islands of Melanesia and Micronesia and then in the Common Era westwards to the island of Madagascar and also eastwards to Polynesia and New Zealand due to the success of the longshan culture it is possible for scholars to separate the culture into geographical subgroups but they are all much more culturally connected than previous cultures of the same lens so rather than going into a lot of detail about all the different localities of the longshan culture we will try to keep it to a much more general overview so that we can make good and steady progress to the second millennium BCE the black pottery is significant as this could very well be the first instance in Chinese history of pottery created with the use of a potter's wheel another advance of the longshan culture was in their stone tools which were created by polishing which is a method of creating edges by the continued chipping and grinding of the tool to achieve the desired result which could be an axe or an ant for example notably we say the presence of external settlement walls and an increase in the amount of arrowheads during this period so this would suggest conflict and maybe this was as a result of a competition for resources between longshan societies so we can see typical modernisations that we have seen elsewhere in both Mesopotamia and Egypt societies fragmented and challenged each other during the 3rd and 2nd millennium BCE the advances in toll production likely had a positive impact on agriculture and we do have evidence of the agriculture of the long Shang culture different types of millet were being cultivated as well as rice and wheat pigs and dogs were traditionally been domestically produced throughout the chinese neolithic but we also see more sheep goats and cattle being produced - there is definite evidence of sericulture demonstrating the production of silk specialized agricultural tools have also been discovered one particular archaeological site that relates to the long shank culture is called telsa and can be found in the modern Shanxi Province of China and close to the Yellow River the site is believed to have been occupied from around 2300 BCE Telsa had the typical rammed earth perimeter wall that is not unexpected at longshan sites however the perimeter was only around a particular area of the city which indicates the presence of stratification within the society with the elite enjoying the comforts of the defences of the walls while the rest of society would have to make do on the outside it would be in the year 2003 that a fascinating discovery was made at Tulsa essentially it is a large constructed platform that has evidence of foundations for pillars further analysis of the pillars demonstrate a link to the Sun and the moon with the slots in between the pillars having been determined to be the area of the sky where the Sun and Moon would rise and particularly at solstices which has led to this discovery being labeled as an observatory this presents a very strong link to other Neolithic and ancient societies and with there being doubts about the cultural connections between China and the Eurasian societies - there West it raises the question of whether this kind of behavior is a natural progression of human intellect and inquisitiveness or whether the fascination and study of the objects of the sky is part of a global cultural spread however the people of China gained their curiosity in the heavenly bodies where they're influenced by migrating culture or just pure natural human inquisitiveness in the sky this is certainly the earliest evidence of such an observatory in the Far East such is the importance of this site in a scientific and historical sense that there has been a major effort to secure the land for the purposes of creating an archeological site the site at tulsa is a fine example of a light long shank culture site so what happened to the long shank culture ultimately geographically the longshan was concentrated around the mouth of the Yellow River with its influence spreading outwards further up the river at the long-chain type site of Tulsa we can see that the long shank culture declined and actually disappeared some scientists speculate that this happened due to the decline of northern hemisphere temperatures which followed the Holocene climatic optimum however even if the type site declined other sites continued and evolved so it may be a little convenient to blame climate change for this one and I'll bet you've never believed I'd say that one of our problems is that archeology tells us one story about the next period while Chinese tradition tells us another story so let's try to work out what happened before the Shang Dynasty next week we will be discussing the Shang Dynasty the Shang Dynasty of China emerged around the 16th century BCE while the longshan culture had declined at the beginning of the second millennium BCE so let us discuss what happened in the middle according to traditional Chinese history there was a dynasty which preceded the Shang Dynasty and its name was that Xia dynasty apparently during the third millennium BCE an emperor emerged from the tribes of prehistoric China and his name was Wayne T also known as the Yellow Emperor the Yellow Emperor would establish a government of China and was succeeded by his grandson shwayne to Shuang choose rule was contemporary with the emergence of the seer tribe and the seer tribe would rise to be the supreme tribe over the tribe of Chia called the nine li tribe different legends and histories contained slightly different stories but I am going to allow the American writer Emily marks article on the ancient history encyclopedia lead my narrative here she mentions that there was a Shia dynasty Emperor called Yale and that he requested that a man called grunt work to control the floods of the Yellow River in order to prevent lens being destroyed however Gwen was not successful and many people remained homeless as a consequence shun was the new emperor after Yao and he asked Gwyn's own son who was called you to try to succeed at controlling the floodwaters were his father had failed you had learned a lot from the mistakes of his father and was able to succeed in controlling the floodwaters such was the adulation that you had received by saving the population that Emperor Chien would announce you as his successor and you would come to be known as you the Great and in some traditions is known as the first great emperor of the shi'ar dynasty the late Emperor's of the SIA dynasty are not spoken of in great terms the last ruler of the south-- dynasty was here and he was overthrown by tang tang was the first king of the shang dynasty which is the first dynasty of china for which we have firm archaeological evidence of his existence so if we don't have any archaeological evidence of this yet dynasty what do we have so we established that the longshan culture went into a decline in around 1900 BCE the site was discovered at a place called alito which provides archaeological evidence from the period between the long Shang culture and the shang dynasty our little show signs of advanced bronze technology with the excavation of a bronze workshop there is also evidence of palaces which point towards the emergence of a more modern culture with an elite class of rulers archaeologists have now called this the type site of the alito culture which is up River near the Yellow River archaeologists have found evidence of very important Palace buildings connected by constructed avenues however the most notable discovery is of burial sites and considerable grave Goods we are not surprised to find bronze and Jade artifacts among mieze but they are also joined by some impressive pottery and items made from seashells turquoise and cinnabar which is a scarlet-colored mineral with all of this impressive looking building work and the impressive artifacts we should explore whether the archeological site of our Leto could be the center of the mysterious xia dynasty archaeologists are convinced that our Leto is a capital city due to the importance of the discoveries it is undoubtedly the home of a very elite class of people who were highly revered within their society so it is very possible that this could be the center of a highly influential dynasty the problem is that nobody can categorically say whether it is exactly the CR Dynasty or not but it does look like the our little culture is the likeliest candidate and that it is a real possibility this is a very concentrated view of nearly think China there are many sites of many different ages in Chinese lands similar trends in the progress of China can be recognized when compared to other cultures of the Near East we know that the Chinese appeared to be well ahead of other global cultures when it comes to pottery we do see similar trends in the emergence of Agriculture with the domestication of animals and crops although the types of animal and crops were specific to the region metallurgy emerged as China into the Bronze Age consistent with the other cultures that we have already explored we also saw the emergence of a writing system that can be directly related to the modern system of Chinese writing essentially cultures coalesced and prospered around the upper and lower yellow and Yangtze rivers other societies emerged for different periods on the coastal lands and the island of Taiwan it would be around the year 1750 BCE that the first major dynasty for which we have substantial evidence of would emerge in northern and eastern China they are the Shang Dynasty centered around the Yellow River but also influential on the lands around the NC River next week we will tell the story of the Shang Dynasty the second traditional dynasty of China after this year [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] "
