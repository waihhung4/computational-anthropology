"It's so late right now but I am\u00a0\ndetermined to finish this video today. *super cool intro scene* Undoubtedly the biggest difference between our\u00a0\ntime and and 100,000 years ago was that there\u00a0\u00a0 were six distinct human species around. I've\u00a0\nput species in inverted commas there because\u00a0\u00a0 modern genetics and and the evidence we have\u00a0\nfor interbreeding has really complicated our\u00a0\u00a0 definition of species but it's still the\u00a0\nmost convenient term to use. Homo sapiens,\u00a0\u00a0 that's me, that's you that's Kim Jong-Un, we\u00a0\nwere restricted to two regions at this time.\u00a0\u00a0 Africa, which as we evolved there is no big\u00a0\nsurprise, but also the middle east. As evidenced\u00a0\u00a0 by various finds but most interestingly for me\u00a0\nthese are preserved footprints from the Nefud\u00a0\u00a0 desert in Saudi Arabia. I absolutely love a\u00a0\npreserved footprint, a handprint on a wall,\u00a0\u00a0 there's something so personal so intimate about\u00a0\nthem. This is roughly, very roughly about 30 to\u00a0\u00a0 40,000 years before the big expansion of homo\u00a0\nsapiens outside of Africa. I know the middle\u00a0\u00a0 east is not in Africa but nature does not care\u00a0\nabout the nice tidy categories that we try to\u00a0\u00a0 impose on it. Further north in Eurasia lived our\u00a0\nold friends the neanderthals. Distant cousins,\u00a0\u00a0 part-time lovers, at this point in time they\u00a0\nextended across a huge swathe of the continent.\u00a0\u00a0 How far east and how far south exactly they\u00a0\nextended though is a big subject of debate.\u00a0\u00a0 Two of the most eastern examples we've found so\u00a0\nfar come from Teshik Tash cave in Uzbekistan and\u00a0\u00a0 Denisova cave in Russia. As you can see there\u00a0\nthe territories of neanderthals and homo sapiens\u00a0\u00a0 likely overlapped in southwest Asia, making\u00a0\nit the most likely source of the \"hnibz\".\u00a0\u00a0 Homo sapien neanderthal initial boinking zone. I\u00a0\ndidn't make that up that's the scientific term. \"It's science\" Further east into asia at this time we had\u00a0\nthe enigmatic denisovans, they're a much\u00a0\u00a0 closer relative of neanderthals but their exact\u00a0\nrange is really hard to pin down. We have for\u00a0\u00a0 sure only recovered two denisovan remains, one\u00a0\nfrom denisova cave and the other from baishiya\u00a0\u00a0 karst cave in Tibet. We know from genetics of\u00a0\npeople in southeast asia that interbreeding\u00a0\u00a0 between homo sapiens and denisovans occurred\u00a0\ndown there but as yet we haven't found a single\u00a0\u00a0 fossil so there's not that much I can say about\u00a0\nthese southern denisovans they're currently sort\u00a0\u00a0 of missing from the fossil record. However, now\u00a0\nthat we know of the existence of denisovans older\u00a0\u00a0 fossils that have been given other classifications\u00a0\nlike homo erectus in places like china\u00a0\u00a0 are now being reassessed and so I can't say much\u00a0\nat the minute but who knows what will come from\u00a0\u00a0 that research. On the islands of southeast Asia\u00a0\nthough is where stuff gets really interesting,\u00a0\u00a0 really funky. Tucked away on the island of java\u00a0\nlived an isolated population of homo erectus.\u00a0\u00a0 These guys were an absolutely crucial step in\u00a0\nour evolution. I've made a video on them before,\u00a0\u00a0 give it a watch, it's an absolute banger. They\u00a0\nonce extended across Africa into Europe across\u00a0\u00a0 Asia but by 100,000 years ago they had either died\u00a0\nout or evolved into other hominins tucked away on\u00a0\u00a0 java though, isolated from the rest of the world\u00a0\na population of them seems to have survived until\u00a0\u00a0 108,000 years ago. Absolutely incredible they\u00a0\nwere they're really a relic of a bygone age. Just over the water from\u00a0\njava on the island of flores\u00a0\u00a0 lived perhaps the most unique\u00a0\nhominin that archaeologists have\u00a0\u00a0 ever discovered homo floresiensis, aka the\u00a0\nhobbits, these tiny folk were probably only\u00a0\u00a0 around one meter tall as adults and it's most\u00a0\nlikely that they descended from a population of\u00a0\u00a0 homo erectus that got stuck on flores and\u00a0\nsuffered from a phenomenon called island\u00a0\u00a0 dwarfism. They may have survived until as recently\u00a0\nas 50,000 years ago which does mean possibly that\u00a0\u00a0 as homo sapiens were expanding across the\u00a0\nworld these two groups came into contact. The final species that we know of from this\u00a0\ntime was found on the island of luzon and so\u00a0\u00a0 is called homo luzinensis there's not much i\u00a0\ncan say about them at the minute because it's\u00a0\u00a0 such a recent find we just know that they were\u00a0\nthere and who knows they may well turn out to be\u00a0\u00a0 our missing southern denisovans, we don't know.\u00a0\nIt's a really early stages of research, but what\u00a0\u00a0 is definitely interesting about homo luzenensis\u00a0\nthough is that luzon has been an island for almost\u00a0\u00a0 three million years so the fact that there\u00a0\nwere hominins there is the best and earliest\u00a0\u00a0 direct evidence we have for hominins traveling\u00a0\nacross the water so pretty cool stuff. Okay I'm trying to finish this video on time but\u00a0\njust as I'm editing it two new apparently distinct\u00a0\u00a0 groups of hominin have been found, one in israel\u00a0\nand the other in china. Dubbed homo longi for\u00a0\u00a0 the time being. Absolutely fantastic skull,\u00a0\nfantastic specimen. Really I should have said\u00a0\u00a0 at least six species at the start because a lot\u00a0\nof the classifications of these fossils are very\u00a0\u00a0 highly debated and these two new finds certainly\u00a0\nadd to that. I don't know how long this process of\u00a0\u00a0 dividing these different fossils that we find\u00a0\ninto different groups it's going to last because\u00a0\u00a0 this time period it really is a period\u00a0\nof incredible human diversity and that's\u00a0\u00a0 easy to forget now in this world where there\u00a0\nis just one hominin left, us homo sapiens,\u00a0\u00a0 but we're really pre-history, deep in pre-history\u00a0\nthe paleolithic it's an incredibly diverse time\u00a0\u00a0 and I do have two videos in the works right\u00a0\nnow specifically on this human admixture, human\u00a0\u00a0 diversity, the evolution of homo sapiens. Stay\u00a0\ntuned for that, but an incredibly diverse time\u00a0\u00a0 and yeah any anthropologists watching if\u00a0\nyou could not publish any more discoveries\u00a0\u00a0 for like a week so I can finish this\u00a0\nbloody video, that would be fantastic. Zooming back out at this map we've\u00a0\nmade please bear in mind that the\u00a0\u00a0 day-to-day year-on-year ranges of these hominins\u00a0\ncould have fluctuated wildly climates change,\u00a0\u00a0 herds move on and our paleolithic ancestors\u00a0\nwere just trying their best to survive. Before we get into the incredible technological\u00a0\nand economical and artistic achievements of the\u00a0\u00a0 time we have to acknowledge that for\u00a0\na lot of our paleolithic ancestors\u00a0\u00a0 it was a hard life I, I wouldn't fancy\u00a0\nswapping places with them that's for sure.\u00a0\u00a0 Now we don't have thousands upon thousands\u00a0\nof human remains from this time period but\u00a0\u00a0 in a study of 200 neanderthal remains ,17 percent\u00a0\nof them had cranial injuries and these injuries\u00a0\u00a0 are similar to what modern rodeo riders often\u00a0\nget suggesting that these neanderthals got\u00a0\u00a0 these injuries from going toe to toe with the\u00a0\nabsolutely massive wild beasts of the ice age.\u00a0\u00a0 We don't have any evidence of archery at this\u00a0\ntime, good convincing evidence of archery\u00a0\u00a0 doesn't appear until around 60,000 years ago\u00a0\nin South Africa. So if you were a neanderthal,\u00a0\u00a0 you were either throwing your spear at your prey\u00a0\nor you were having to go up close and personal\u00a0\u00a0 and stab it yourself. When we weren't being hurt\u00a0\nby our prey we were becoming prey ourselves in a\u00a0\u00a0 recent excavation of a cave just outside Rome,\u00a0\nnine neanderthal remains were found the oldest\u00a0\u00a0 dating to around 100,000 years ago. Now it's\u00a0\nvery early days in the excavation of this\u00a0\u00a0 site but archaeologists currently believe that\u00a0\nthese neanderthals were dragged there by hyenas.\u00a0\u00a0 Before you even went out and hunted your first\u00a0\nanimal though you could have starved to death.\u00a0\u00a0 Studies of neanderthal teeth have suggested\u00a0\nthat they frequently went through periods\u00a0\u00a0 of nutritional stress in their childhood, so\u00a0\nlife was hard back then it was really hard.\u00a0\u00a0 Getting eaten by a hyena is a\u00a0\ncertified bummer no doubt about it. Homo sapiens neanderthals and denisovans were\u00a0\nall creating stone tools using what we call\u00a0\u00a0 the levallois technique. Rather than finding\u00a0\na stone and just chipping away at it until\u00a0\u00a0 it's the shape you want, humans would prepare\u00a0\nthe core. They would remove flakes from the\u00a0\u00a0 outside of the core to produce the desired shape\u00a0\nroughly and then with a big bash on the bottom,\u00a0\u00a0 the flake that you had broken off would be the\u00a0\nspear point that you wanted. This was not a new\u00a0\u00a0 technology for the time humans had been doing it\u00a0\nfor several hundred thousand years by this point,\u00a0\u00a0 but it does show that they were thinking about\u00a0\nusing their resources efficiently. Using this\u00a0\u00a0 technique one core could produce multiple blades\u00a0\nand points so it was kind of the model t ford of\u00a0\u00a0 their time. This is mass production paleolithic\u00a0\nstyle. Even though this levallois technique\u00a0\u00a0 might not have been new, we do seemingly see the\u00a0\nemergence of some new technologies at this time.\u00a0\u00a0 Over in Dar es Sultan, Morocco, archaeologists\u00a0\nhave found this 90,000 year old knife made from a\u00a0\u00a0 mammal's rib and over in Katanda in the Democratic\u00a0\nRepublic of Congo, archaeologists have found this\u00a0\u00a0 absolutely beautiful bone harpoon. Around this\u00a0\ntime we start to see the emergence of these really\u00a0\u00a0 specialized and sophisticated bone tools. They're\u00a0\na great indication that our cognitive abilities\u00a0\u00a0 were improving, that we were able to create\u00a0\nreally specialized tools for specialized jobs.\u00a0\u00a0 Up north in Eurasia neanderthals weren't slacking\u00a0\noff either. It's been well documented now that\u00a0\u00a0 they were using pine and birch resin to create\u00a0\nglues to attach spear points to their shaft.\u00a0\u00a0 Similarly in South Africa it seems that humans\u00a0\nwere heat treating silcrete rocks, that they used\u00a0\u00a0 to create tools, in order to create better thinner\u00a0\nflakes, more consistent flakes, more suitable for\u00a0\u00a0 use as projectiles. This is just a taste of\u00a0\nwhat people were up to ,there's a lot more\u00a0\u00a0 that could be said about the technology of this\u00a0\nmiddle paleolithic. But I think these examples\u00a0\u00a0 really highlight the ingenuity of our ancestors,\u00a0\nnot only were they creating really specialized\u00a0\u00a0 tools but they were physically altering the\u00a0\nproperties of the raw material available to\u00a0\u00a0 them. They were literally scientists, there's no\u00a0\nother way to say it, this is literally science. There's a lot said about the paleolithic diet\u00a0\nthese days and it's it's alleged health benefits. \"Today were traveling back in time\"\u00a0\n\"the paleo diet\" \"paleo\" paleo\" but not one video or book that I've ever\u00a0\nseen has ever acknowledged the fact that tiny\u00a0\u00a0 homo floresiensis might have been hunting\u00a0\ndwarf elephants. In the same cave that\u00a0\u00a0 the homo floresiensis fossils were found\u00a0\narchaeologists also noted large accumulation\u00a0\u00a0 of dwarf elephant bones. A reasonable hypothesis\u00a0\ntherefore is that they were brought into that cave\u00a0\u00a0 by homo floresiensis. Hobbits hunting dwarf\u00a0\nelephants is probably the most interesting thing\u00a0\u00a0 to have ever happened in the history of the world,\u00a0\nand I don't want to watch another video about\u00a0\u00a0 the paleolithic diet that doesn't mention that.\u00a0\nYou're you're skipping the most interesting thing. Obviously the hunting of animals was really\u00a0\nimportant for all paleolithic people but\u00a0\u00a0 we may have overstated its importance in\u00a0\nthe past. Let me give you an example,.\u00a0\u00a0 Neanderthals from Belgium were eating wooly\u00a0\nrhino and wild sheep, very meat heavy diet,\u00a0\u00a0 leading the absolutely stereotypical paleolithic\u00a0\nlifestyle. However neanderthals down in El Sidron\u00a0\u00a0 cave in Spain seemingly a little meat and had\u00a0\na diet that revolved a lot around nuts and,\u00a0\u00a0 mushrooms, maybe even moss. So the picture is\u00a0\na lot more complicated than just \"neanderthal\u00a0\u00a0 equals meat eater\" for sure that was the\u00a0\ncase a lot of the time but their diets varied\u00a0\u00a0 according to the regions that they lived in and\u00a0\nthe resources available to them. Down in Africa at\u00a0\u00a0 this time there's a lot of debate about whether\u00a0\nwe see evidence for a broad spectrum economy.\u00a0\u00a0 That's the archaeological term for\u00a0\ntaking full advantage of the resources\u00a0\u00a0 in your area not just hunting the biggest\u00a0\ngame available to you. Fish and sea mammals\u00a0\u00a0 start to make more of an appearance on the menu.\u00a0\nDown in Mozambique archaeologists have found a\u00a0\u00a0 grinding stones with wild seeds impressed into\u00a0\nthem and in South Africa people were roasting\u00a0\u00a0 starchy vegetables and tortoises in their hearths.\u00a0\nThrowing a tortoise on the fire is probably\u00a0\u00a0 the closest thing a person in the paleolithic\u00a0\ncould have gotten to fast food. The development of\u00a0\u00a0 broad spectrum economies was a really significant\u00a0\nmoment in human history even though it seems so\u00a0\u00a0 trivial to us now, it would ultimately lead\u00a0\nto the development of agriculture but we\u00a0\u00a0 don't see agriculture fully emerge until\u00a0\naround 12,000 years ago, after the climate\u00a0\u00a0 had become a lot warmer and a lot more stable.\u00a0\nNot because of Atlantis, looking at you marvel. Still one hundred thousand years ago homo sapiens,\u00a0\u00a0 they were doing okay they were developing the\u00a0\ntools and the economies and the flexibility\u00a0\u00a0 that would eventually allow us\u00a0\nto take the whole world by storm. Now one hundred thousand years ago isn't exactly\u00a0\nthe earliest evidence we have for symbolic\u00a0\u00a0 expression but it certainly seems to have\u00a0\nincreased around this time again as with the\u00a0\u00a0 bone tools suggesting something really concretely\u00a0\nhad switched in our brains. Homo sapiens,\u00a0\u00a0 neanderthals, denisovans we were all making art.\u00a0\nFor us homo sapiens there was one material which\u00a0\u00a0 really dominates the archaeological record more\u00a0\nthan any other and that's ochre. One hundred\u00a0\u00a0 thousand years ago someone in blombos cave\u00a0\neither dropped or deposited or abandoned this\u00a0\u00a0 ochre processing toolkit. It's very simple really\u00a0\nit's a, it's a shell, it's some ochre of course,\u00a0\u00a0 there's a grinding stone and in amongst the\u00a0\nochre archaeologists found traces of the spongy\u00a0\u00a0 bones that we find in our bodies. Although i'm not\u00a0\nsuggesting it was human bones. I don't know that\u00a0\u00a0 we know that. But the addition of these spongy\u00a0\nbones was probably due to their fat content. Maybe\u00a0\u00a0 their fat within the bone marrow was used as a\u00a0\nbinding agent for the ochre? We don't know that's\u00a0\u00a0 just the the hypothesis of the archaeologists\u00a0\nthat found it but it's pretty reasonable I think,\u00a0\u00a0 pretty reasonable. Just these four things they're\u00a0\nso humble but they're so significant. Being\u00a0\u00a0 able to think creatively and express yourself in\u00a0\nabstract ways, it really is what makes us human. \"I want to get you to try being creative\" Ochre would go on to be the predominant material\u00a0\nthat humans use to create those really absolutely\u00a0\u00a0 stunning uh prehistoric handprints, but the\u00a0\nearliest one of those we've dated so far is\u00a0\u00a0 from around 40,000 years ago. So long after\u00a0\nthe time period we're talking about. The only\u00a0\u00a0 piece of art or symbolic expression that we can\u00a0\nreasonably attribute to denisovans are these bones\u00a0\u00a0 from Henan in China. What they mean, we don't\u00a0\nknow. Did they mean anything? We don't know.\u00a0\u00a0 But nevertheless a denisovan did them and\u00a0\nit shows that something was bubbling away\u00a0\u00a0 in their brains. For Neanderthals though we\u00a0\nhave a lot of evidence for symbolic expression.\u00a0\u00a0 Specifically from 100,000 years ago in Krapina in\u00a0\nCroatia, neanderthals might have made jewelry out\u00a0\u00a0 of these eight eagle talons and one toe bone. It\u00a0\nseems from the wear marks on them that they were\u00a0\u00a0 strung together. Now we don't know whether\u00a0\nthey were worn as a necklace, or a bracelet,\u00a0\u00a0 or a rattle, or something else that we haven't\u00a0\nthought of. In true Damien Hirst style these same\u00a0\u00a0 groups of neanderthals were peeling the flesh\u00a0\nfrom each other's skulls. That could have been\u00a0\u00a0 simple cannibalism, just to not starve to death,\u00a0\nbut there's not really that much nutritional\u00a0\u00a0 benefit in eating someone's forehead it's not a\u00a0\nvery meaty part of the body. It's not unreasonable\u00a0\u00a0 to think that this was some form of symbolic\u00a0\nact, some form of secondary burial ritual maybe. Roughly 115,000 years ago in\u00a0\nwhat is now Qafzeh in Israel,\u00a0\u00a0 a young woman and a young child died. We don't\u00a0\nreally know anything about them. Of course\u00a0\u00a0 evidence suggests that they lived the typical\u00a0\nlifestyle of paleolithic hunters and gatherers.\u00a0\u00a0 But we don't know what language they spoke. We\u00a0\ndon't know what their laugh sounded like. We don't\u00a0\u00a0 know what their favorite food was. But I think\u00a0\nwe can say something about them with certainty,\u00a0\u00a0 I think we know that they were loved. When they\u00a0\ndied, the community around them, their friends,\u00a0\u00a0 their family. They took time out of their day to\u00a0\ndig a shallow pit and place them both carefully\u00a0\u00a0 inside. These people meant something. In\u00a0\ntheir moment of death, they were cared for.\u00a0\u00a0 There's no better illustration of the\u00a0\nhumanity of our paleolithic ancestors. That's it. That's the end of the\u00a0\nvideo. I'm going to bed. See Ya "
