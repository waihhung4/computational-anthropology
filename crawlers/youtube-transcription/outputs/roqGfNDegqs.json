"this production is brought to you by the world history encyclopedia and the study of antiquity and the middle ages aridogenesis written by joshua j mark narrated by d w draffin the sumerian flood story also known as the eredu genesis sumerian creation myth sumerian deluge myth is the oldest mesopotamian text relating the tale of the great flood which would appear in later works such as the atrahasis 17th century bce the epic of gilgamesh circa 2150 to 1400 bce and most famously the story of noah and his ark from the biblical book of genesis circa 1450 bce the story is dated to circa 2300 bce in its written form but is thought to be much older preserved by oral tradition until committed to writing the extant work is badly damaged with a number of significant lines missing but can still be read and easily understood as an early great flood story scholars who have studied the text generally rely on the later acadian babylonian atrahasis which tells the same tale to fill in the blanks of missing text from the broken tablet the story most likely influenced the egyptian flood story known as the book of the heavenly cow dated in part to the first intermediate period of egypt 2181 to 2040 bce but certainly was the inspiration for the later mesopotamian works as well as the biblical narrative of noah the story was first discovered in 1893 ce during the period of widespread expeditions and excavations throughout mesopotamia funded by western institutions the good man in this version of the tale chosen to survive the flood and preserve life on earth is the priest king zid surah of the city of surapac whose name means life of long days this same figure appears as atrahasis exceedingly wise in the later work that bears his name as utnaphistim he found life in the epic of gilgamesh and as noah rest or peace in the book of genesis expeditions and discovery in the 19th century ce western institutions including museums and universities funded expeditions to mesopotamia in hopes of finding physical evidence which would corroborate the historicity of biblical narratives the 19th century ce saw the unprecedented practice of increasingly critical readings of the bible which questioned long-held beliefs regarding its divine origin and supposed infallibility this age of skepticism would see the publication of darwin's origin of species in 1859 ce suggesting that human beings rather than being created by god as a little lower than the angels psalm 8 5 evolved from primates in 1882 ce the german philosopher friedrich nietzsche published his work the gay science containing the famous line god is dead and we have killed him alluding to the seeming triumph of technology and secularism over traditional religious belief prior to the rise of secular skepticism and even during the period when darwin and nietzsche were writing the bible was considered the oldest book in the world completely original and of divine origin this view was encouraged by the work of the archbishop james usher lived 1581-1656 ce creator of the usher chronology which relying primarily on the book of genesis and referencing other biblical narratives dates the creation of the world to 22nd october 4004 at 6 pm since the bible had been written by god it was infallible and could be trusted not only in dating the age of the earth but for any other aspect of human existence the expeditions sent to mesopotamia were supposed to find evidence supporting this view but found the exact opposite cuneiform tablets deciphered from the mid-19th century ce onwards challenged the traditional view of the bible directly in that they contained a number of stories motifs and symbols which appeared in the biblical narratives and predated them among these was the sumerian flood story the first known account of the tale people of the time knew as noah's ark the badly damaged tablet was discovered in the ruins of the ancient city of nippor by an expedition funded by the university of pennsylvania in 1893 ce it was left untranslated until 1912 ce when the german esteriologist arno perbol lived 1881-1958 ce deciphered it as part of his job for the university of pennsylvania the existence of a pre-biblical account of noah's flood suggested to some that the traditional interpretation of the bible needed to be rethought while to others that a mesopotamian account of a great flood corroborated the biblical story just from another point of view the british archaeologist sir leonard woolley lived 1880 to 1960 ce challenged this later claim through his excavations at the ruins of ancient ore in the 1920s ce during the 1928 1929 excavation season woolly sank a series of shafts into the soil and determined there had been significant flooding in the region but that this was a local not global event and further was not a singular incident but had happened a number of times when the tigris and euphrates rivers overflowed their banks woolly's excavations were mirrored elsewhere in mesopotamia by other archaeologists who came to the same conclusion the historicity and originality of the biblical narrative of the great flood could no longer be maintained and usher's chronology was challenged and dismissed by scholars although both are still maintained by christians in the present day who maintain the so-called young earth view scholar stephanie dally commenting on further excavations in mesopotamia throughout the 20th century ce writes no flood deposits are found in third millennium strata and archbishop usher's date for the flood of 2349 bc which was calculated using numbers in genesis at face value and which did not recognize how highly schematic biblical chronology is for such early times is now out of the question the small tablet of the sumerian flood story found at nippor missing much of its narrative had provided woolly with the academic freedom to make the kind of assertions concerning the flood in the 1920s ce which would have been unthinkable a mere century before summary the sumerian flood story begins with the creation of the world the black-headed people the sumerians and then the animals the sumerian gods who undertake the act of creation an enlil enki and ninhursag would remain among the most powerful sumerian deities for centuries until they were eclipsed by amorite theological paradigms under hammurabi of babylon reigned 1792-1750 bce and later the assyrians after humans and animals are created the gods decree the establishment of cities beginning with eridu which was considered the oldest city in the world each of the cities are given to a god to oversee thereby establishing the tradition of every city having its patron deity and reference seems to be made to the further establishment of irrigation systems after this section of the narration a number of lines are missing which must have explained why the gods anne and and leo the leaders of the sumerian pantheon decide to destroy humanity with a great flood in the later atrahasis the reason is that people become too numerous and too loud and disturb and lil's rest in atrahasis enlil sends a drought then a plague and then famine to the earth to decrease the population and quiet the roar of the humans but each time enki god of wisdom and friend of humanity tells the people what they should do to reverse enlil's plagues and they are able to go on with their lives as before it is probable these details also appeared in the earlier sumerian flood story where enki has the same role the story then continues noting how all the gods swear an oath presumably that they will not interfere in the unenlil decision to destroy humanity and then the central character of the tale is introduced zeod surah a king of the city of sura pak and a priest since enki presumably has taken the oath not to interfere with the flood along with all the other gods he cannot warn ziad surah directly and so speaks to a wall knowing that ziad surah on the other side of it will hear him at this point there are more lines missing which would have detailed ziod surah's creation of a large boat which he filled with animals and the seed of mankind the narrative resumes with a depiction of the flood which rages for seven days and seven nights until the seas quiet and uttu utu shamash the sun god appears zead surah makes a hole in the side of the boat and utu in the form of the sun's rays enters dutifully makes a sacrifice to the god but what happens after is lost through more missing lines in the end an enlil seem to have repented of their decision as they are grateful that zeudsura has preserved their creations they grant him eternal life in the paradise of the land of dilmun based on fragments of the tablet it seems the story continued after this seeming conclusion for another 39 lines but the content is lost text the following text comes from the literature of ancient sumer edited by the scholars jeremy black graham cunningham eleanor robson and gaborzo yomi the opening line referencing stopping the annihilation of my creatures might be suggesting that the gods initially gave human beings long life spans as co-workers with the gods who would take on their labor and make the earth pleasant for them as the story is given in atrahasis in this later work after the flood measures are taken by the gods to limit the human lifespan and increase mortality and these kinds of details may have made up the missing text from the earlier sumerian flood story which follows i will stop the annihilation of my creatures and i will return the people from their dwelling grounds let them build many cities so that i can refresh myself in their shade let them lay the bricks of many cities in pure places let them establish places of divination in pure places and when the fire quenching is arranged the divine rights and exalted powers are perfected and the earth is irrigated i will establish well-being there after ahn and lille enki and ninh horsog had fashioned the black-headed people they also made animals multiply everywhere and made herds of four-legged animals exist on the plains as is befitting here there are approximately 32 lines missing i will oversee their labor let the builder of the land dig a solid foundation after the of kingship had descended from heaven after the exalted crown and throne of kingship had descended from heaven the divine rights and the exalted powers were perfected the bricks of the cities were laid in holy places their names were announced and the were distributed the first of the cities aridu was given to nudimud the leader the second bad tibira was given to the mistress the third laraga was given to pabil sagh the fourth zimbir was given to hero utu the fifth soro pog was given to and after the names of these cities had been announced and the had been distributed the river was watered here there are approximately 34 lines missing seat in heaven flood mankind so he made then nintude holy inanna made a lament for its people enki took counsel with himself on enlil enki and nin horsog made all the gods of heaven and earth take an oath invoking on and unleal in those days zeod surah the king the gudug priest he fashioned the humble committed reverent day by day standing constantly at something that was not a dream appeared conversation taking an oath by invoking heaven and earth in the kior the gods a wall ziad surah standing at its side heard sidewall standing at my left side sidewall i will speak words to you take

assembly cannot be revoked the order announced by ahn and enlil cannot be overturned their kingship their term has been cut off their heart should be rested about this here there are approximately 38 lines missing all the windstorms and gales rose together and the floods swept over the land after the flood had swept over the land and waves and windstorms had rocked the huge boat for seven days and seven nights utu the sun god came out illuminating heaven and earth ziod surah could drill an opening in the huge boat and hero utu entered the huge boat with his rays zhidsura the king prostrated himself before uttu the king sacrificed oxen and offered innumerable sheep here there are approximately 33 lines missing they have made you swear by heaven and earth on and enlil have made you swear by heaven and earth more and more animals disembarked onto the earth zhiyud surah the king prostrated himself before ahn and enlil on and enlil treated ziutsura kindly they granted him life like a god they brought down to him eternal life at that time because of preserving the animals and the seed of mankind they settled zeudsura the king in an overseas country in the land of dilmun where the sun rises here there are approximately 39 lines missing conclusion the sumerian flood story is considered the first written account of the popular myth of a worldwide flood sent by divine agency which appears in almost every culture of the ancient world the seemingly universal treatment of the same story has suggested to some that there must have once been such an event which people of different cultures independently responded to with the creation of the story modern day scholars tend to reject this interpretation and instead suggest that an early story of a great flood and the destruction of humanity resonated with an ancient audience and came to be widely repeated traveling through trade from one region to another each culture adapted the story to their own needs and vision and so the original was altered to greater or lesser degrees as it was told and then written down in different locales the original may or may not have been the sumerian flood story but many scholars in the present day including stephanie dally believe it was dally writes all these flood stories may be explained as deriving from the one mesopotamian original used in travelers tales for over 2000 years along the great caribbean routes of western asia translated embroidered and adapted according to local tastes to give a myriad of divergent versions the concept of a god's wrath or the collective displeasure of many gods causing catastrophic events was understood simply as how the world worked by ancient civilizations around the world the story of the great flood would have served a number of purposes but primarily explained the creation of the world as the people knew it while strongly suggesting they pay greater attention to the divine will in their daily lives in each version of the flood story mentioned above the gods or god repent of their decision in the genesis story god even places the rainbow in the sky as a promise he will never flood the world again but to an ancient audience this would not have meant that the divine could not as easily send some equally dire punishment for human transgression of its will at some point in the future whenever it wanted to the story would have then encouraged people to er on the side of caution in adhering to religious cultural precepts in order to maintain the goodwill of a deity or deities who could as easily destroy as support
