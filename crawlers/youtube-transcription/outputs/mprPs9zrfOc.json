"all right so now we're gonna talk about the shang dynasty now remember a dynasty is a ruling family so the ruler there would be passed on from generation to generation within the family you think about kings and princes in Europe and in different civilizations that we've studied but it was usually the the oldest son that would then take over and rule the kingdom when the father died and so the that would stay within the families so what we think is that the transverse rulers were probably part of the Jie dynasty and little known is known about that that dynasty at all um but the Shang may have built the first Chinese cities and onion was China's first capital so now we have these bigger cities that we have this big civilization that's developing we have for starting to have bigger cities and the people of the Shang Dynasty were divided into groups the most powerful group was the king and his family okay that makes sense because the Kings the one that's in charge the armies use chariots and bronze weapons to take over nearby areas so it's interesting that we have like chariots and bronze weapons that some of the other civilizations that we have seen and so they all kind of developed similar technology for how to get around and maybe they got these chariots from when the ideas for the chair it's from um they were visited by um some more Western societies or something but it is interesting that we see kind of some of these similar technologies across different civilizations "
