"ziggurats were a form of Temple common to the Sumerians Assyrians and Babylonians of ancient Mesopotamia they were constructed using principles of sacred geometry just like all ancient pyramid-like structures around the world except that these were constructed entirely of mud and Clay rather than stone sunbaked bricks made up the core of the zigat with fired bricks facing the outside which were also very beautifully glazed in different colors and designed with symbols of astrological and Astro theological significance the earliest ziggurats began near the end of the early dynastic period around 4500 years ago so it is quite amazing and impressive that they held up so well and are still here for us to Marvel [Music] at zigurat size varied but often they had seven tiers uh between let's say two and seven tiers and they supported a shrine at the top according to Herodotus and this sacred Shrine was the scene of a sacred marriage an elaborate sex ritual which was revealed veed with the highest importance and held a significance that cannot be overstated for the ancient Sumerian ideas about the interaction of humans gods and goddesses the Mesopotamian ziggurats were not places for the public to come and enter for worship but instead were believed to be Dwelling Places for the gods themselves and each City had its own Patron god or goddess and only priests were permitted inside as it was their responsibility to care for the gods and to attend to their needs the astrologer priests were very powerful members of Sumerian society and this was not an egalitarian society at all the social order of the nobility was based largely on Ancient Bloodlines the sacred marriage began with a a journey and procession by the king to en's Temple or it would have been called ishtar's temple in the case of Babylon which came after Sumer and there would be preparation of the Bride which was actually a sacred prostitute and she would be washed Anointed with oils and fr fragrances and adorned with beautiful garments the procession was accompanied by the singing of love songs and other festivities and a great banquet but the core of the ritual was an act of sexual Congress between the king and the goddess figure and this sexual Union was intended to promote the fertility of the land and it was the type of Sex Magic ual that modern secret societies still practice and Ault authors such as the late Alistair Crowley were directly inspired by so just to be clear the sacred marriage was not taboo at all but a state sponsored occasion a required Royal ritual in which the king played the male role of the deity dumuzi the spouse of inana who could be compared to Venus Aphrodite Ishtar and many other goddess archetypes the name depending mostly on the time period and [Music] geography the Ishtar gate was the eighth gate to the inner city of Babylon excavated in the early 20th century with the original kept in Berlin this dedicatory inscription on the Ishtar gate by Nebuchadnezzar is engraved in Kuna form dating back to 575 BC and this excerpt translates as follows and I quote Nebuchadnezzar King of Babylon the faithful Prince appointed by the will of Marduk the highest of princely princes beloved of Nabu following the filling of the street from Babylon both gate and entrances became increasingly lower therefore I removed them laid their foundations with asphalt and had them made with blue bricks on which wonderful bulls and Dragons Were depicted I covered the roofs by laying Majestic Cedar lengthwise over them I hung doors of Cedar adorned with bronze at all the gate openings with bulls and dragons in the gateways and thus Adorn them with luxurious Splendor so that people might gaze upon them in wonder I let the temple be built like a mountain of fired bricks in the Babylonian Precinct incidentally this is now in the pergamon museum and is really worth checking out in person if you ever get a chance to visit Germany while it is not true that agricultural civilization started only in Mesopotamia during the Hol scene it is true that animal domestication did flourish there and Ox were like tractors of the ancient times so their civilization really boomed and horses with chariots were like battle tanks to the relatively technologically primitive people in Europe and the Indian subcontinent by comparison who lost whatever civilization they had attained at the end of the pene or the close of the Ice Age a period of great Global cataclysms recorded in myths and legends around the world from the sinking of Atlantis to the biblical flood to the Epic of Gilgamesh evidence of this Babylonian diffusion can be seen linguistically in the many Indo-European or Aryan languages that spread across the old world but it can also be found in more subtle places such as our modern banking system which is run by an elite pseudo religious cult that can trace their Roots back to the mud brick ziggurats between the Tigris and
