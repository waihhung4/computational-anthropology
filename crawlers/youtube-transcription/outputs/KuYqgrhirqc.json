"One of the largest floods in human history\nmight have started a civilization. It begins with an earthquake 4,000 years ago in what is now China. When the quake strikes,\nit sets off a landslide, stopping up a Yellow River gorge\nwith a wide pile of rocky debris. At the same time,\nthe earthquake causes the collapse of a downstream village --\nkilling some 20 villagers, but leaving this bowl of noodles unscathed. Back at the Yellow River gorge, water begins to pile up\nbehind the landslide dam. An enormous lake forms over\nthe course of a few months. When water starts flowing over the top of\nthe makeshift dam it quickly gives way,\nsending a flood racing hundreds of kilometers downstream\u2014 scouring the gorge and riverbed, and filling the earthquake fissures around the Lajia site with sediment. The sediment deposits\nreveal that the earthquake and flood happened the same year. Scientists were the able to radiocarbon date the remains of the villagers\nto around 1900 BCE. This is where the founding of a\ncivilization part comes in. The first Chinese dynasty--the Xia dynasty-- was once known as\nthe \u201clegendary dynasty.\u201d The only evidence that it existed came from historic texts written\n500 years after the fact. What we know from those writings is that the Xia dynasty started\nwith a giant flood. If the Xia did exist -- and\nthat\u2019s always been a big \u201cif\u201d -- the problem is dating it. According to the history books, China\u2019s first dynasty was\nstarted around 2070 BCE and was led by Emperor Yu, who earned the heavenly\nmandate to rule after spending decades\ncontrolling flood waters. The problem is, there\u2019s been no archeological\nevidence to support that story. Until now. The legendary flood waters\ncontrolled by Yu could have been from this\nvery real outburst flood on the Yellow River. What\u2019s more, this new date for the flood lines up neatly with the\ntransition from Neolithic to the Bronze age\nculture in ancient China. If the researchers are correct, that means the trigger for\nthis massive cultural transformation-- and the start of the Xia dynasty--\nwas an extreme natural event. "
