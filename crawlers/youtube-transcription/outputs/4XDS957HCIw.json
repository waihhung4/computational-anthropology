"[Music] the pictish problem produced by DW drafted in the ecclesiastical history of the English people the venerable bead has this to say of the origins of the pits as they were understood in 731 CE at the present time there are five languages in Britain these are the English British Irish pictish as well as the Latin languages to begin with the inhabitants of the island were all britons from whom it receives its name they sailed to Britain so it is said from the land of armorica and appropriated to themselves the southern part of it after they had got possession of the greater part of the island beginning from the south it is related that the pictish race from scythia sailed out into the ocean in a few warships and were carried by the wind beyond the furthest bounds of Britain reaching Ireland and landing on its Northern Shores the picts asked for the grant of a place to settle in the Irish answered that the island would not hold them both but said they we can give you some good advice as to what to do we know of another Island not far from our own in an easterly Direction which we often see in the distance on clear days if you will go there you can make a settlement for yourselves but if anyone resists you make use of our help and so the picts went to Britain and proceeded to occupy the Northern parts of the island because the britons had seized the southern regions as the pics had no wives they asked the Irish for some the latter consented to give them women only on condition that in all cases of doubt they should elect their kings from the female Royal Line rather than the male and it is well known that the custom has been observed among depicts to this day two thousand years ago the Northern British Isles was the land of the pits the Romans came and went invading the British Isles but never subbuing Scotland Hadrian's famous wall is Testament to that then the church came and after them the Angles and Saxons and Vikings by the time of the Norman Conquest the ancient picts were already a legend a nearly mythical people more closely associated with Celtic fairies and Druids than a historical pastoralist Federation of distinct tribes and ethnicities but what happened to the pits where did they go over the Millennia the descendants of the original pics have been lost to time for generations of academics this has been known as the pictish problem and only with the help of new technologies including both DNA analysis and oxygen and strontium isotope analysis of the bodies we still possess and the living residents of the lands the pits used to rule have we been able to shine light on this ancient mystery published in 2023 this open source article in plus genetics provides some initial solutions to the pictish problem the text has been edited and adapted for a wider audience there's a link to the original paper in the description imputed genomes and haplotype-based analyzes of depicts of early medieval Scotland reveal fine scale relatedness between Iron Age early medieval and the modern people of the UK abstract there are long-standing questions about the origins and ancestry of the picts of early medieval Scotland Circa 300 to 900 CE prompted in part by exotic medieval origin myths their enigmatic symbols and inscriptions and the meager textual evidence the picts first mentioned in the late 3rd Century CE resisted the Romans and went on to form a powerful Kingdom that ruled over a large territory in Northern Britain in the 9th and 10th centuries Gaelic language culture and identity became dominant transforming the pictish realm into Alba the precursor to the medieval Kingdom of Scotland to date no comprehensive analysis of pictish genomes has been published and questions about their biological relationships to other cultural groups living in Britain remain unanswered introduction the genetic origins of the present-day populations of the UK have been extensively studied and can broadly be modeled as a mixture of three deep genetic ancestries mirroring Western European ancestry Western European Mesolithic hunter-gatherer ancestry early European farmer ancestry derived from Anatolian Neolithic farmers and late Neolithic step-related ancestry our understanding of more recent demographic changes in the British and Irish Isles referring to Britain Ireland and Associated smaller islands has also been expanded by a large-scale sequencing of ancient genomes revealing extensive gene flow from Mainland Europe into Southern Britain during the middle Bronze Age which contributed to genetic differentiation between iron age groups from Southern and Northern Britain present-day genetic diversity in Wales Cornwall Devon and Western Ireland indicates a long-standing genetic structure possibly already present during the Iron Age but the lack of ancient samples especially from Scotland limits our ability to directly test this hypothesis and pockets of older ancestries could have survived regionally in isolated populations for extended periods the British and Irish Isles witnessed a complex cultural turnover from the Iron Age to the early medieval period the Romans occupied part of Britain to Southern Scotland from 43 to Circa 410 CE however the single autosomal DNA study of Roman Britain suggests this occupation resulted in little detectable gene flow from Mainland Europe multiple episodes of long-distance migration across Western and Central Eurasia intensified during the late antique period Circa 300 to 800 CE before and following the collapse of the Western Roman Empire in Britain angles Saxons and other Germanic speaking peoples likely originating in Scandinavia the low countries and parts of Germany settled predominantly in Southeastern and Central Britain with genetic evidence of extensive admixture with local populations carrying genetic ancestry from the Iron Age during the so-called Viking age starting about 800 CE Scandinavians settled in the Dane law in Northern and Eastern England as well as in the coastal areas of Ireland and Northern and Western Britain which led to admixture with the inhabitants of Ireland and Western and Northern Britain over nearly four centuries in addition local culturally distinct groups lived in Britain around the end of the Roman period before major Anglo-Saxon settlement the britons speaking The ancestral language of Welsh as well as Latin inhabited the island South of the Firth of fourth The gales dalriata occupied our Gale and the southern Hebrides in Scotland and the picts lived in the rest of Britain north of the fourth the genetic diversity between and Within These groups is poorly understood in particular the lack of genomes from Scotland has limited our ability to understand how the genetic structure changed between the Iron Age and the early medieval period among the people's present during the first Millennium CE in Britain the picts Circa 300 to 900 CE are one of the most enigmatic their unique cultural features Ergo pictish symbols and the scarcity of direct writing resulted in many diverse hypotheses about their origin lifestyle and culture the so-called pictish problem other than a list of kings and difficult to decipher Alum and alphabetic inscriptions the only written evidence comes to us from their neighbors the Romans and later the gaels britons and Anglo-Saxons this deficiency has been compounded by a sparse archaeological record with few settlements and fewer cemeteries from this period in the modern era perceptions of pictish Origins have varied often according to cultural and political biases with depicts and their languages regarded as Germanic Gaelic britonic Basque and illyrian among other theories in the 1950s Jackson influentially argued that the pics spoke a non-indo-european language and a Celtic language akin to ancient gaulish the current consensus is that they spoke at Celtic language closest to that of neighboring britons from which Cornish Welsh and Breton derive however some still argue from undeciphered inscriptions and other words that some picked spoken otherwise unknown language presumably derived from a pre-celtic population this theory is underpinned by recent findings arguing that late Bronze Age migrations in southern Britain may have introduced Celtic or Celtic related languages in this area however these migrations were seemingly not as influential in Northern Britain thus the question remains of whether the pits Were Somehow fundamentally different from their neighbors in the medieval period the picts were considered immigrants from Thrace north of the Aegean Sea skidia Eastern Europe or Isles north of Britain however Irish accounts and the northumbrian scholar bead added that before settling in Britain the pits first gained wives in Ireland on the condition that pictish succession passed through the female line this is the origin of the theory that depicts practiced a form of matrilini with succession and perhaps inheritance going to the sister's son rather than directly through the male line however our earliest source for this practice beads ecclesiastical history of the English people finished in 731 CE stated that it was limited to occasions when the succession was in dispute it is now argued that the origin Legend was intended to reinforce pictish identity and legitimize particular Kings whose claim to the throne were through their mothers nevertheless matrilini remains one potential explanation for the absence of father to son's succession in at least one pictish Royal Dynasty before the mid- 8th century here we aim to provide new insights into the genetic diversity of the pits through analysis of two ancient whole genomes sequenced from individuals excavated from two pictish-era cemeteries London Links 5 Southern pickland and ballantor Eastern Ross Northern pickland we imputed diploid genotypes alongside published medium to High coverage ancient genomes including individuals from England dating from the Iron Age Roman and early medieval periods and co-analyzed these with previously imputed ancient genomes from the orkney islands dating from the late Iron Age pictish period and Viking age using allele frequency and haplotype-based methods we aim to determine the genetic relationships between the picts and neighboring modern day and ancient populations in addition using the Mito genomes of seven individuals from London Links we explore how differences in female Mobility due to possible post-marital residence Customs I.E Metro locality female endogamy may have shaped the genetic diversity at this possible High status cemetery and discuss its implication for our understanding of pictish elite descent systems DNA extraction sequencing and radiocarbon dating we retrieve DNA from eight individuals one from ballantor Easter Ross and seven from London Links five representing the northern and southern parts of picked land 10 samples from London Links and three from ballantor were radiocarbon dated to the 5th to 7th Century CE the individuals lived During the period that pictish identity existed and are from areas likely to have been within pictish territories Circa 700 CE analysis of uniparental genetic markers the mitochondrial haplogroups observed in the samples are common in present-day Northwestern Europeans with the subclade j1c3 being identified in three individuals out of eight in terms of paternal why chromosomal lineages we assigned the fourth individual from London Links lun004 to r1b df49 which is predominantly distributed in the UK and Ireland and a subclade to r1b-p312 s116 haplogroup introduced to Britain by Bell Beaker peoples during the chalcolithic alongside step-related ancestry during the chalkolithic r1d derived haplogroups largely replaced the predominant i2a Y chromosome lineage in the British Neolithic except in orkney where i2a persisted into the Bronze Age r1b subclades are extremely common across Britain and Western Europe from the Iron Age onwards allele frequency-based genomic affinities in ancient Britain to investigate population affinities of the individuals from pickedland We performed principal component analysis and admixture analyzes on a data set comprising present-day Europeans the PCA shows that the ancient individuals from Britain broadly fit with present-day individuals whose four grandparents lived in Britain however we noticed some variability among these individuals as bal003 and lun004 fall within the modern Welsh cluster but with bal003 being notably closer to the present-day Scottish arcadians English and Northern Irish clusters suggesting some degree of genetic differentiation amongst individuals from pickedland the Iron Age and Roman period individuals from England are spread across the Modern English Northern Irish Scottish and Welsh clusters four ancient arcadians from the iron and Viking ages fit with present-day Welsh Northern Irish and Scottish populations however two Viking age arcadians are intermediates between the British and Scandinavian clusters consistent with previous results finding evidence of admixture in these individuals between british-like and scandinavian-like ancestries the early medieval individuals from England are intermediate between Modern English people and Scandinavians which is consistent with various degrees of admixture between iron age groups from England and immigrants from northern Central Europe these results agree with the pseudo-haploid-based analyzes of the genomes that show a broad Affinity to Modern Western Europeans but with a much improved resolution haplotype inferred genetic structure in early medieval Britain haplotype-based methods have been shown to outperform Conventional unleaked snip approaches in the detection of population substructure our analysis shows that the genomes from London Links and ballantor form a genetic cluster together with genomes from the Iron Age and Roman period from England except 6D T3 who instead chose strong Affinity to Western Central Europe or Scandinavia and from the late Iron Age to Viking age from orkney except VK 204 and vk-205 who carried substantial scandinavian-like ancestry included in this cluster are also Viking age individuals from Britain Iceland and Scandinavia the latter likely corresponds to individuals buried in Scandinavia but whose parents were from a British like gene pool based on outgroup F3 the individuals from orkney Scotland and England dated from the Iron Age to Medieval period are symmetrically related to each other however we also note that bal003 but not lun004 show multiple instances of genetic sharing with early medieval individuals from England implying substantial shared ancestry and possibly recent gene flow from a source genetically similar to those samples we therefore suggest that individuals from pickland should not be considered a homogeneous genetic group but instead a complex mixture of contemporary genetic ancestries the unlinked approach implemented in the admixture analysis also reveals a minor but detectable genetic structure while the proportion of ancestry components are similar across bal003 lun004 Iron Age and the Roman period in England the late Iron Age and unadmixed Viking age or cadians are differentiated from this group they show an absence of the gray and green ancestry components likely first introduced by Scandinavian migrants as they are first observed in vk-204 and vk-205 and then in modern arcadians these components are also carried at a high proportion in modern Norwegians and Danes iron and Viking age individuals from orkney with an absence of scandinavian-like admixture share more genetic drift with modern arcadians the results confirm the relatively High proportion of shared genetic drifting orkney for the last 2000 years nevertheless a high relative count of identity by dissent sharing between lun004 and late Iron Age or Viking age or Canadians demonstrates that gene flow between orkney and Mainland Scotland or a source outside Scotland that also contributed to ancestry to lun004 likely occurred the Iron Age and unadmixed Viking age arcadians also show the highest degree of a red ancestry component which is inconsistent with having originated from direct gene flow from any population included in this study and instead likely reflects retention of a less diverse pre-iron age ancestry in orkney and or strong genetic drift such as a bottleneck or founder effect in fact Recent research showed that Bronze Age populations in orkney were differentiated from their counterparts on Mainland Britain because of strong genetic drift as a result of a small ancestral population size which was deduced from the observation of a relatively High number of short runs of homozygosity the Bronze Age orkney population also retained the Y chromosomal haplogroup I2 which is associated with Neolithic ancestry while the r1b haplogroup associated with bell Beaker expansion largely replaced the I2 haplogroups in the rest of Britain moreover although modern arcadians are differentiated from the rest of the British Isles due to extensive admixture with Scandinavians recent genomic research shows that genetic drift also played an important role this is consistent with our results that show a high proportion of shared identity by descent segments among modern arcadians meaning they share a high proportion of recent common genetic ancestors relative to most modern European populations typical of small or genetically isolated populations overall these data indicate a long-term small population size which likely contributed to the extensive genetic drift observed in modern arcadians the genetic differentiation between populations living in orkney in Scotland during the late Iron Age and early medieval period could thus be partially explained by different degrees of genetic drift analysis of genetic continuity across Britain the pictish data allow us to obtain a transect of Iron Age early medieval genomes across Britain and directly look at the pattern of haplotypes sharing between them and present-day genomes the Iron Age and Roman period except 6dt3 individuals from England and Scotland share more identity by descent segments with present-day individuals from Scotland including orkney Northern Ireland and Wales than with any other European populations included in our analyzes consistent with the structure observed in the PCA analysis we also show that all early medieval individuals excluding i-077 share more identity by dissent with Modern Danish than with any other present-day population suggesting genetic continuity between modern day Danish and the ancestors of these individuals the analysis also revealed High identity by dissent sharing between early medieval individuals from England and present-day people across Britain following a southeast northwest Klein this pattern suggests that Northern Continental European ancestry associated with Anglo-Saxon migrations expanded out of Southeastern England followed by admixture with local populations a scenario consistent with previous research bal003 and lun004 share a high proportion of identity by descent segments with present-day people from Western Scotland Wales and Northern Ireland similar to the individuals from late Iron Age orkney and England however unlike these individuals lun004 and to a lesser extent bal003 share fewer identity by descent segments with the present day Eastern Scottish population sample previously suggested that the genetic structure between Western and Eastern Scotland could result from The Divide between the kingdoms of the Gaelic speaking dalriata in the west and pics in the East which is seemingly in contradiction with the results presented here instead the present-day genetic structure in Scotland likely results from more complex demographic processes that cannot be reduced to a single model we propose two non-exclusive processes that might explain the observed pattern of identity by dissent sharing between the Iron Age and early medieval populations and the present-day Scottish population the first is substantial admixture from immigrants that brought Iron Age or Cadian and england-like ancestries likely independently which partially replaced the Eastern Scottish early medieval gene pool indeed in the following centuries 1100 to 1300 CE Eastern Scotland received substantial immigration such as settlers from Britain south of the fourth France and the low countries under this scenario bal003 and lun004 are good representatives of the broader ancestry present in Scotland During the pikdish period alternatively the ancestors of bal003 and lun004 share more identity by descent segments with present-day people from Western Scotland Wales and Northern Ireland because they or their direct ancestors migrated from these regions but did not contribute substantially to later generations via admixture with local groups in eastern Scotland this scenario is consistent with an emerging picture of West East lifetime mobility of both males and females in the early medieval period in Scotland under such a model it may be feasible that there are indeed still undiscovered pockets of Eastern pictish period ancestry that was differentiated from ancestry carried by bal003 and lun004 and which contributed significantly to present-day populations from Eastern Scotland oxygen and strontium isotope analysis of teeth from these individuals holds promise to characterize this further importantly we also emphasize that stochasticity likely affected the pattern of identity by descent sharing in such a small sample size indeed High variability in IBD sharing is observed amongst individuals from the early medieval and iron age groups and to some extent between bal003 and lun004 our results also show substantial identity by dissent sharing between Iron Age Viking age and present-day arcadians supporting our observations using allele frequency-based methods of strong genetic continuity in this region over time therefore the marked genetic differentiation between orkney and Mainland Britain is not only a result of Scandinavian admixture as previously hypothesized but also pronounced genetic continuity that persisted for at least 2 000 years the relatively low IBD sharing between bal003 and lun004 and modern-day arcadians suggests the emergence of pictish culture in orkney was not associated with population replacement but largely due to cultural diffusion and connections identity by descent segments in Iron Age individuals from Southeastern England are widespread throughout Western and Northern Britain compared to the more recent Romano British individuals from northern England the latter however do not share substantial IBD with any present-day people of the British Isles The Only Exception is 6dt3 who was from the same genetic population as two early medieval individuals i0159 and i0773 with Scandinavian and Northern european-like ancestry 6D T3 also share relatively more IBD segments with the present-day population from Scandinavia Belgium and the UK suggesting that scandinavian-like ancestry could have spread to the British Isles before the early medieval period social organization seven mitochondrial DNA genomes were retrieved at London Links which allows us to address questions about the pictish social organization reflected in the individuals interred at the site the use of the cemetery was relatively short likely around 130 years and the individuals excavated were adults the diversity of mitochondrial DNA lineages was high and none of the individuals shared an immediate maternal ancestor it is worth noting that individuals retrieved from the horned Cairns complex show evidence of familial links based on the presence of Highly heritable skeletal traits congenitally missing teeth Taurus mandibularis and septal apertures on the humeri however the two individuals yielding mitochondrial DNA lun001 and lun009 are not maternally related in a Metro local system which is typical of matrilineal descent low-female post-marital migration and high male migration decrease female mitochondrial DNA diversity this result suggests the individuals buried at London Links were unlikely to have been practicing meta locality this assumes that this cemetery is a snapshot of the community near London Links and individuals did not return to their natal place for burial after having lived in their marital community ongoing isotope analyzes focused on the movement histories of the London Lynx individuals using strontium oxygen and other isotope approaches May further characterize sex-specific Mobility additional Y chromosome analyzes will also help confirm whether petrolocality or neolocality was more common in pikdish society 70 percent of Metro local societies are associated with a matrilineal system insofar as funerary treatment can tell us about the social organization in life it is unlikely that the community at London Links followed a matrilineal inheritance system this interpretation challenges older Arguments for matrilineal succession among pictish rulers however while some individuals buried at London Links may have been of elevated social status the relationship between people buried in monuments such as these and the pictish uppermost Elite is uncertain the cemetery evidences a wide diversity of cultural practices mirrored in the high mitochondrial diversity suggesting relatively high levels of mobility within the pictish social structure at this level of society the burials are organized in complex and stand-alone Graves made of round and square Cairns and long cysts this complexity suggests that as social practices influence the genetic structure of populations the social status of archaeological sites can in turn bias our understanding of population structure in this case the samples may only be representative of a small proportion of the overall pictish population non-harmonious kinship systems I.E petrolocal and patrilineal or matrilocal and matrilineal societies may also impact the genome in different ways the lack of broad sample size and useful markers why chromosome to enhance kinship and mitochondrial dna-based findings remains an obstacle to illuminate further pictish descent patterns [Music] conclusions overall our data supports the current archaeological consensus arguing for regional continuity between the late Iron Age and early medieval periods but likely with complex patterns of migration lifetime mobility and admixture we also show that bal003 and lun004 were genetically differentiated from the pre-viking age picks from orkney which suggests that pictish culture spread to orkney from Scotland primarily via cultural diffusion rather than direct population movement or intermarriage we detect strong continuity between local Iron Age and present-day peoples in orkney but less pronounced Affinity between early medieval and modern people in eastern Scotland more ancient genomes from the Iron Age and early medieval periods in the UK are necessary to illuminate these relationships further combined with analyzes of Lifetime Mobility using complementary approaches Ergo isotope analysis on a more local level are mitochondrial DNA analysis of individuals interred at London Links is arguably inconsistent with Metro locality this finding challenges the older hypothesis that pictish succession was based on a matrilineal system assuming that wider pictures Society was organized in such a manner [Music] foreign foreign "
