"Today we will be talking about the great rise of\u00a0\u00a0the Shang Dynasty, and its fall led\u00a0by a concubine, possessed by a fox. Hey guys, welcome to Learn Chinese Now, \nI'm your host Jared Madsen and today we will be talking about the Shang Dynasty, which was\u00a0founded somewhere around 1600 BC and lasted for 600 years. Now the Shang Dynasty began because\u00a0Cheng Tang, a guy named Cheng Tang led his people and overthrew the Xia Dynasty. So who was Cheng\u00a0Tang, well, there's this story that when he was, he was younger and he was walking around, \nand he\u00a0sees this guy who's putting up all these nets, \nand this guy's boasting right, he's like, you know what, I got four sides to my net, I'm gonna catch every animal any bird in the sky\u00a0\nany animal on land, I'm gonna get all the animals, and Cheng Tang hears this and he thinks, wait a second, you know, he goes up to the guy he's like wait, let me, let me get this straight, you're\u00a0going to catch all the animals? That sounds rather, rather excessive. So he said let me give you a\u00a0\nsuggestion. Cheng Tang said to the guy, I suggest that you take down three of the sides right, you\u00a0leave one side up and he says well that you know, well, how am I gonna, how am I gonna catch anything?\u00a0He says don't worry, you know, uh, Some animals will go to the right, okay, you're not gonna get those.\u00a0\nSome will go to the left, you're not going to get those but some will go into your net and you\u00a0\nwill get what you need. This is how you should do it, this is how you should live your life, and the people heard this story and they thought, wow this guy is, he because, he was already\u00a0\nknown as being a very benevolent person and they thought he's not only good to people, he's\u00a0good to the birds in the sky, and the animals on the ground, he thinks he thinks of everyone.\nThis is, this is our guy. This story is called, Wang, means net, Kai, means open San, means three, and Mian, means sides. Nowadays they have an expression right, so it's the same thing Net opens but it's one side. This actually came from that story but it\u00a0more means, it's, it's like the idea of if somebody, if somebody did something wrong or or they made\u00a0a fool of themselves or something like that, like you open up the net, you, you give them a way out\u00a0right, they can save some face, they can, they can kind of they can get out. Now there's another story\u00a0\nabout him, and this story happened after he led his people, he took over uh China, he, he formed the\u00a0\nShang Dynasty, but for the first seven years of the Shang Dynasty there was no rain. the rivers\u00a0dried up, the lakes dried up, people were dying, so he he finds his Sorcerer and he says what do we do?\nwe have to do something? right, and so at the time, the common practice was you would take Mulberry branches, logs, and you would form this pile, and you would sacrifice Livestock on this pot you\u00a0would put them there and then you would set it on fire and that was your that was your sacrifice to the heavens right, \nthat was to help bring about whatever it is that you were trying to get. So\u00a0they tried that right. \nthey tried that for a while and it didn't work and then finally the sorcerer\u00a0said okay, to end this drought, we need a person, and Cheng Tang  thought well you know what I mean I'm obviously,\u00a0I'm a horrible ruler I think will sacrifice me. So he he goes back, he, he takes a shower he cuts\u00a0\nhis hair he puts on his nicest clothes, like he really wants to present himself to the heavens\u00a0\nright, he wants to show how sincere he is and he lies down on the logs and says okay that's\u00a0\nit let's sacrifice me you know bring the torch over light me on fire right as they come over\u00a0to do that, it starts to rain, and rain, and rain, it rains so much that it fills the rivers back up,\u00a0\nit fills the lakes back up, you know the crops grow and people have water to drink they have food to\u00a0eat and they he goes down in history as be being an incredibly benevolent ruler,\n he was willing to\u00a0literally be burnt to death, \nto sacrifice his own life in such a horrific way to save the people\u00a0\njust to do whatever he could to save them to get the water. So now he is seen as one of the\u00a0\ngreat benevolent rulers in Chinese history. So this story in Chinese is called Tang is Cheng Tang, his name Dao, means to pray Sang means Mulberry, and then Lin means Forest So when you say it refers\u00a0to this story of his great sacrifice. So the Shang Dynasty had a couple things that are associated\u00a0with it, one are Oracle bones, and another is bronze So we'll jump into the Oracle bones here in Chinese it's called okay, Jai means like a tortoise shell a shell Gu Means bone and Wen means like\u00a0\na language or a written script So back in those times they would take either a tortoise shell or\u00a0they would take bones from animals and they would basically ask questions right, like, whatever\u00a0questions they had. \nIt was a divination process and they would take those they would put them into\u00a0\nthe fire sometimes due to Poker they just put them right in the fire they would the bones would crack,\u00a0\nthe shell would crack and then the sorcerer would take it look at it and go oh okay this is what it\u00a0means,\nhe was able to read that and and give the people the information, \nand then he would actually\u00a0write Chinese characters on those bones. Now they found records of I think it was around 150,000 of these bones uh 4,500 Chinese characters and 1500 that are still kind of recognized and and used today. The Shang Dynasty is also known for its bronze that was one thing that helped them\u00a0\nuh defend against all these groups now you have to remember that those times were rough actually\u00a0during the 600 years of the Shang Dynasty, they had to move their Capital five different times\u00a0\nbecause there were these large tribes and groups that would come in and attack, \nbut one advantage\u00a0they have was bronze, they were really good at making bronze. Now the way they made it is is very\u00a0interesting, it's called Shi means to lose, La means wax, and Fa means method or technique. so it's the\u00a0technique of losing wax. What does that mean? How does that work? Well, basically what they would do\u00a0\nit's quite simple you take some wax and you you form the wax into whatever\n it is that you want to make right you want to make an arrowhead or you want to make a bow\n or you want to make whatever\u00a0it is then you would take clay, \nand you would carefully put that clay around the wax you\u00a0put it in the sun, you let it dry, then you put it in the kiln to bake it. the fire melts the wax so\u00a0the wax runs off, so you're left with this mold. Then what you would do is take the bronze, the\u00a0lit you would melt it down so it's liquid you would pour it in to the mold it would take\u00a0the shape of the original wax,\nwhatever it was that you're making the arrowhead or the bowl \nor\u00a0the sword or whatever it was. So they used bronze in a lot of things. Mostly though they used it in\u00a0\nweapons or in some of these ceremonies that they did. uh but one big advantage that they did with\u00a0the bronzes that they would \nuse it on wheels on their chariots. so they made their wheels extra\u00a0strong so that their leaders could ride around in chariots, and and you know and like during during the wars and and check out the army and check out things, \nso that was brought them a huge\u00a0advantage. Now the Shang Dynasty was also a very well traveled Dynasty they would travel all over\u00a0the place. So the Shang Dynasty was not located on the ocean, \nit was more in central China. but\u00a0they would often travel to the ocean, and they had boats, and they would travel all around. They'd\u00a0go to different islands and they would bring back seashells to to the capital. To the main area where\u00a0the dynasty was and so seashells actually became their currency. So they, in Chinese it's called so a Bei is the seashell, that's the currency that they would use that was their money and today\u00a0we see that Bei is used in many words that have to do with money. So for examples are Pin means poor, Jian means cheap, Shang means to reward, and Ci means to grant, like to grant some money on somebody,\n or\u00a0grant something on its way so all of these have that radical Bei, the character Bei is in them,\u00a0\nsignifying that it has to do with money that the seashell, the shell is money, it is currency, and it's still used in these Chinese characters today. So after 600 years of rule in China, the\u00a0Shang Dynasty came to the last emperor, Zhou Wang now Zhou Wang apparently was very smart he was a\u00a0well-studied man and he was also good at battle right he would you know, he was good at fighting\u00a0\npeople, he was even good at fighting wild animals with his bare hands right, uh so this guy was you know he was it was a pretty impressive guy but he had this concubine, her name was Daji and\u00a0as the legend goes she was possessed by an evil Fox an evil fox demon, that is what possessed\u00a0her and so uh apparently she the whole thing is that she led him a strand so he did all of\u00a0\nthese horrible things these humans sacrifices and he would he would torture people and and all\u00a0of this horrible stuff that he did to his people this and this brought about the downfall of the\u00a0Shang Dynasty, and then the Zhou Dynasty comes, crushes them, and they are the next Dynasty that we\u00a0will talk about next time.
