"[Music] [Music] this recording is brought to you by ancient history encyclopedia and the YouTube channel the study of antiquity and the Middle Ages enuma Alish the Babylonian epic of creation full text written by Joshua J Mark narrated by DW draffen the enuma Alish also known as The Seven Tablets of Creation is the Mesopotamian creation myth whose title is derived from the opening lines of the piece when on high all of the tablets containing the myth found at ashure Kish ashure bonap paal's library at ninva sultane and other excavated sites date to Circa 1200 B B CE but their copons indicate that these are all copies of a much older version of The Myth dating from long before the fall of Sumer in Circa 1750 BCE as Marduk the champion of the young gods in their war against Tiamat is of Babylonian origin the Sumerian AA Ani or en leel is thought to have played the major role in the original version of the story The Copy found at ashure has the god ashure in the main role as was the custom of the cities of Mesopotamia the god of each city was always considered the best and most powerful Marduk the god of Babylon only figures as prominently as he does in the story because most of the copies found are from Babylonian scribes even so AA does still play an important part in the Babylonian version of the enuma Alish by creating human beings summary of the story the story one of the oldest if not the oldest in the world concerns the birth of the Gods and the creation of the universe and human beings in the beginning there was only undifferentiated water swirling in chaos out of this swirl the waters divided into sweet fresh waterer known as the God absu and salty Bitter Water the goddess Tiamat once differentiated the union of these two entities gave birth to the younger Gods these young Gods however were Extremely Loud troubling the sleep of absu at night and distracting him from his work by day upon the advice of his viser Mumu absu decides to kill the Young Gods Tiamat hearing of their plan warns her eldest son eni sometimes Aya and he puts absu to sleep and kills him from apsu's remains eni creates his home Tiamat once the supporter of the younger Gods now is enraged that they have killed her mate she consults with The God quu Who advises her to make war on the younger Gods Tiamat Rewards queing guu with the tablets of Destiny which legitimize the rule of a God and control the fates and he wears them proudly as a breastplate with Queen goo as her Champion Tiamat summons the forces of chaos and creates 11 horrible monsters to destroy her children Aya enki and the younger Gods fight against Tiamat futilely until from among them emerges the champion Mar Marduk who swears he will defeat Tiamat Marduk defeats kingu and kills Tiamat by shooting her with an arrow which splits her in two from her eyes flow the Waters of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers out of tiamat's corpse Marduk creates the heavens and the Earth he appoints Gods to various duties and binds tiamat's 11 creatures to his feet as trophies to much agil from the other gods before setting their images in his new home he also takes the tablets of Destiny from kingu thus legitimizing his Reign after the gods have finished praising him for his great Victory and the Art of his creation Marduk consults with the god Aya the god of wisdom and decides to create human beings from the remains of whichever of the Gods instigated Tiamat to war kingu is charged as guilty and killed and from his blood Aya creates Lulu the first man to be a helper to the Gods in their Eternal task of maintaining order and keeping chaos at Bay as the poem phrases it aah created mankind on whom he imposed the service of the Gods and set the gods free following this Marduk arranged the organiz ization of the Nether world and distributed the gods to their appointed stations the poem ends in tablet 7 with long Praise of Marduk for his accomplishments commentary the anuma Alish would later be the inspiration for the Hebrew scribes who created the text now known as the biblical Book of Genesis prior to the 19th century CE the Bible was considered the oldest book in the world and its narratives were thought to be completely original in the mid 19th century CE however European mums as well as academic and religious institutions sponsored excavations in Mesopotamia to find physical evidence for historical corroboration of the stories in the Bible these excavations found quite the opposite however in that once cunia form was translated it was understood that a number of IAL narratives were Mesopotamian in origin famous stories such as the fall of Man and the great flood were originally conceived and written down in Sumer translated and modified later in Babylon and reworked by the Assyrians before they were used by the Hebrew scribes for the versions which appear in the Bible although the basic Paradigm of the biblical narratives and the Mesopotamian stories of align closely there are still significant differences as noted by scholar Steven Bertman both Genesis and enuma Alish are religious texts which detail and celebrate cultural Origins Genesis describes the origin and founding of the Jewish people under the guidance of the Lord inuma Alish recounts the origin and founding of Babylon under the leadership of the god Marduk contained in each work is a story of how the cosmos and man were created each work Begins by describing the watery chaos and primeval darkness that once filled the universe then light is created to replace the darkness afterward the heavens are made and in them heavenly bodies are placed finally man is created these similarities not withstanding the two accounts are more different than alike in revising the Mesopotamian creation story for their own ends the Hebrew scribes tightened The Narrative and the focus but retained the concept of the all powerful deity who brings order from chaos Marduk in the enuma Alish establishes the recognizable order of the world just as God does in the Genesis tale and human beings are expected to recognize this great gift and honor the deity through service in Mesopotamia in fact it was thought that humans were co-workers with the gods to maintain the gift of creation and keep the forces of chaos at Bay the Anum Alish in Babylon Marduk gained prominence in Babylon during the reign of hamurabi 1792 to 1750 BCE and superseded the popular goddess en in worship during hamar robi's reign in fact a number of previously popular female deities were replaced by male Gods the enuma Alish praising Marduk as the most powerful of all the gods therefore became increasingly popular as the God himself Rose in prominence and his city of Babylon grew in power scholar Jeremy black writes the rise of the cult of Marduk is Clos connected with the political rise of Babylon from city state to the capital of an Empire from the cite period Marduk became more and more important until it was possible for the author of the Babylonian epic of creation to maintain that Not only was Marduk king of all the gods but that many of the latter were no more than aspects of his Persona the anuma Alish was read and recited widely throughout Mesopotamia but was especially important at the New Year Festival in Babylon during this Festival the statue of Marduk would be taken from the temple and amidst the revelers was paraded through the streets of the city out the gates to vacation in a small house built for this purpose the anuma Alish especially it is thought the praise from tablet 7 would be sung or chanted during this procession the text of enuma Elish the following translation comes from Mesopotamian creation stories by WG Lambert and is used under Creative Commons license from
