"what is the origin of a bamal legislator or bamal congress the origin of that is Sumeria Mesopotamia ancient Mesopotamia in the Sumerian tabs we discover that thousands of years ago they created this exact same system they created a bamal Congress and a bamal legislator in a recent video Billy Carson dives into the workings of the US voting system spotlighting the Electoral colleges significant yet widely misunderstood role Carson explains that while many Americans believe their individual vote directly elects the president this isn't actually how the US presidential election process operates instead it is the Electoral College a body of 538 electors from across all states that ultimately decides the winner Carson points out that the electoral college system was created during the Constitutional vention of 1787 as a middle ground between electing the president via direct public vote and through Congress founding figures like James Madison and Alexander Hamilton were skeptical of a fully democratic system worrying that direct elections could lead to mob rule the Electoral College therefore served as a buffer between the people's vote and the final outcome enabling selected representatives to have the final say you who don't pick the president the Electoral College picks the president when voters cast their ballots in the presidential election they are actually voting for electors not directly voting for the candidates themselves brittanica.com encyclopedia britannica.com I'm reading from the encyclopedia guys the design of the Electoral College Carson notes is deeply tied to the nation's dark Legacy of slavery he delves into the 3 fifths compromise which counted enslaved individuals as 35ths of a person increasing representation for Southern States in Congress and the Electoral College this system ensured that southern states which had fewer free voters but larger enslaved populations would have enhanced influence in presidential elections by giving States a number of electors based on their Congressional representation including both senators and representatives this system boosted the political power of states with significant enslaved populations it has deep dark current ties still to this day to slavery in America and it developed out of a system that considered slaves 3- fifths of a human it's called a three- fifths compromise the 35ths compromise United States history brittanica.com the 35th compromise agreement between delegates from the northern and southern states at the United States constitutional convention in 1787 said that each slave will be 3 fifths of the population so that means five slaves would only be worth three so that three fths of the enslaved population will be counted for determining direct Taxation and representation in the house of Representatives Carson emphasizes that the Electoral College remains a system primarily controlled by the elite allowing a few select electors many of whom are not publicly known to cast the final vote he highlights that electors are not strictly bound to the popular vote in their state meaning they have at times voted contrary to the state's majority these faithless electors illustrate the gap between the popular vote and actual electoral decisions historical examples include elections where presidents such as George W Bush in 2000 and Donald Trump in 2016 won the presidency through the Electoral College despite losing the popular vote and who are these electors who are the electors it's not the voters you'll never see their face you'll never know their name you'll never know where they live you'll never see them on the news but behindth Veil people actually decide who they're going to select as president or who they're going to vote for from that particular State regardless of the popular vote the popular vote is irrelevant to them Carson also explores the attempts to reform the Electoral College some states have proposed legislation to commit their electors to the popular vote winner within their state known as the national popular vote interstate compact this compact is designed to ensure that the presidency reflects the popular vote outcome but it requires enough States to join before it can take effect however Carson points out that powerful states have opposed this shift preferring to retain the traditional Electoral College framework to Carson this system is a means of Elite control fundamentally limiting the true power of the popular vote he argued that the Electoral College rooted in outdated practices and power structures preserves the influence of a small group over the broader voting public if you like this video and you want to see more amazing content go ahead and check out the next video on our Channel "
