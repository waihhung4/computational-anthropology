you my love Elizabeth and her new name now is Elizabeth Carson okay so it was it was amazing and we're going to bring that to you very soon we got married in Bora Bora uh now what's incredible about Bora Bora by the way since we're talking about Egypt and ancient civilizations tonight Bora Bora is the dipole of Egypt as a matter of fact if you draw line through Bora Bora straight through the Earth you pop out at where you pop out at Egypt and according to the Ancients who actually owns or who was that particular Island Island area attributed to ownership of touti touti from Africa AKA th the Atlantean priest king so it was the beautiful place Perfect Place uh perfect timing and uh got married on December the 4th and that was at the Four Seasons at 444 p.m. and we did our forbidden nuptuals listen it's all about alignments and what's crazy is it wasn't even planned to be like that the original wedding date was on December the 9th and then it had to get moved up some because of another engagement that we had to take care of in Egypt so we at the last minute we moved the date and some people on unfortunately because of that couldn't even make it so it wasn't planned and then uh the Four Seasons that was planned but the start time was supposed to be 3 pm. but we had some rain in the morning which delayed some of the setup and allowed the actual ceremony to begin at 444 PM just incredible Universal Clockwork what can you say everything works out in Divine time so we're here tonight we're going to have a great talk talking about the ancient secrets of Samaria and Kemet and what are these ancient Secrets I want to talk about tonight I want to talk about the ancient secret of longevity of Life extended life uh lifespans that aren't really talked about in the mainstream we've heard about you know they got technology we know they got they had great building techniques and they had advaned this and advaned that hardly anybody's talking about the lifespans okay so we're going to talk about the lifespans tonight the lifespans of these people from the ancient past pretty much our ancient ancestors and uh what I'm going to do is I'm going to go a little bit into the Samaran Kings list all right uh and then from the Samaran Kings list I'll go the predian Kings and probably into some of the post delial Kings and I'll start telling you their recorded lifespans I'm going to show you the actual document that it's recorded on and tell you where it's located okay and then I'm going to go into the uh Egyptians Kings list and we'll talk a little bit about the Egyptians and the pre-dynastic era and then into the dynastic era and how they connected to the samarians okay and let me go ahead and just remove one spammer from the live chat because

get that spam out of there as well again thank you for all the congratulations in the live chat I appreciate it okay so now what is the surian Kings list it's an incredible list of kings that ruled on planet Earth long long long long long long ago we're talking about very long ago so when I see inside of actual University book textbooks and when I study classes online like at Harvard you find out that they want to tell you civilization going back about 68,000 years there's a big problem with that date that time period first of all the reason why you're talking between five to 6,000 is because that's about the average time that most of the Samaran tablets are known to be or used to be had known to be you know had known to been existing or had been written that that date going back that far and so that time period or that time frame got put into Dogma into religious systems and then they now say the planet's only that old it's a farce and it's a joke because we know we found things on this planet hundreds of thousands tens of hundreds of thousands and even millions of years old and so you can't just wish this stuff away out of existence just because your Dogma tells you no this is the time frame but where are the religions get the time frame they got the time frame from the dating of most of the tablets now we know even tablets that go back further than that so now what do they have to say Well they're not going to change their Dogma obviously okay but the Samaran Kings list is incredible because it records the names of these Kings it records the how long each king ruled and it records the City that they ruled from okay it records the city that they actually ruled from think about that so we're talking about a high level of information we're talking about a real account and then when we go back we meaning archaeologists to the names of these places in Mesopotamia which is now modern day Middle East Iraq Iran Tyran and all these places guess what we discover we discover remnant of those ancient cities they actually existed we' we can see the remnant structures in the ground buried by sand some sticking up above the sand some underneath the sand discovered through ground penetrating radar and lar and everything else so we know that these structures in these cities did exist and the evidence the physical evidence of them is still here today I'm talking about everything through a ser Acadian uh Babylonian you know Persian all of that turkey and then we're GNA don't worry we're talking about Africa too but I want to talk about the Samaran Kings list because this is the most accurate list of Kings in procession that exist with these extensive lifespans the Egyptian kings list actually only picked up around the third Dynasty because a lot of the information had kind of been lost we kind of got the names here and there we kind of got the dates through estimates of star alignments and some other accounts but Sam Maran Kings List Right Down the Line okay right down the line and what's incredible about this is you discover that they even let some women rule at some point so some women even had kingship over the planet this list is not ruling over a specific region of the Earth but over planet Earth itself pretty interesting all right so let's go through it let me tell you a picture now where can you find this Sumerian Kings list this mythical these mythical tablets well there's only one and that actually is located the original is located at the ashmolean Museum in Oxford England so I took a trip there myself and this is the photo that I took there of the original surian Kings list this is taken directly from Elizabeth cell phone camera on an iPhone 14 and these images are copywritten but this is the these are the images this is one tablet taken from multiple sides because you can get very close and you can go around 180 degrees around the tablet where it's located currently at the ashmolean Museum in Oxford England it's written in CIA form which is where you take a stylus a wooden stylus and you wedge with a wedge at the end you wedge imprint into wet clay this is an extensive list and a lot of information nobody sits around on a Saturday afternoon in ancient times and goes you know what I think I'll get my wedge out and get some wet clay and a stone and I'll just start making up names of kings and locations and times and dates and and ruling periods I think I'll just make it up I think I'll just fabricate this just for just for the fun of it didn't happen didn't happen these people literally recorded what they knew in ancient times every moment was precious every moment was about survival every moment was about learning growing especially during a golden age nobody just got out wet clay and a stylus and just start imprinting CIA form into wet clay to make up sci-fi stories it it just didn't happen you see so we discredit our ancestors quite a bit by saying oh no that can't be real what we're doing is we're saying they're dumb we're saying that they were stupid we're saying that they that they were idiots not the case in morea in most cases they were way smarter than us if anything we're we're trying to catch up to what they already knew and we're not even close so the more I hear people doubting these ancient texts and tablets and what these ancestors were capable of doing with construction Tech techniques and advanced tools and and everything else that they were able to accomplish including talking about traveling in the skies and even into space in ancient tablets and we and we and we scoff and we say oh that's that's baloney and Meanwhile we're driving cars with combustion engines in the 21st century we're driving cars with batteries that are made from Forced child labor in Africa and we're talking about Noah that can't be real they didn't do that we can barely get from point A to point B I had to fly from Miami Florida to Cambodia it took me 38 hours it took me 38 hours to fly from Miami to Cambodia why is that happening in the 21st century for goodness sake is this the best we can do is this the best we can muster up is this the best technology we have no so when we look back at what these ancient cultures were capable of doing and we laugh and we scoff and we say ah man they just you know it's a myth but meanwhile the evidence is Right laid right before our feet and we choose to ignore it put our head in the sand we're slapping them in the face and it's disgusting so let's get into it I'm going to pull down this Samaran Kings list all right let me just pull up I'm going to read it it won't be on your screen but I'm just going to read it for you guys I'm going to go through it here I'm going to go through kind of slow some of these names are pretty pretty uh intricate the best way I can put it some of these names are pretty hard to pronounce all right but I'm going to pull it up real quick and I'm going to go over it and uh we're going to read it and we're going to talk about these live spans all right the Samaran Kings list translation so what I'm going to start reading from here now is a translation of the actual tablet itself all right and let me uh pull this out and separate it from the uh the other screen real quick and then we're going to go into this all right now let me pull this up and overlay it here all right let me move this over to the right like I said I'm going to go through it kind of slow somebody said my audio is lagging a little bit I don't know who knows about these we keep calling this stuff modern technology it doesn't seem modern because every time I you know every few weeks I get on it's some kind of technological problem let me know in the chat about the the lagging is it lagging or are we good somebody said it's lagging okay so what I'm going to do is I'm going to mute it and I'm going to come back in hold on a second guys let me see if I can do it this way because I want to be on point with this okay so I tried to refresh the uh the soundboard tell me how it sounds now am I lagging or am I good now because now I've just refreshed the soundboard am I on target is it is it uh am I okay I'm good now okay perfect so I refresh thank you everybody I appreciate that y'all so good man I appreciate so I'm gonna pay attention over here because if you see me lagging again let me know and I'll stop and I'll refresh the soundboard again all right it's this technology it's just I tried to buy the best technology but like I said we keep talking bad about our ancestors and doubting what they were capable of doing and they were able to communicate through stones and I'm trying to communicate with you through High Fidelity technological equipment and I'm still having problems you see ridiculous all right let me um get this straight all right and I'm looking up because I'm looking at a screen that's way above the camera and for all you guys who are making donations I appreciate you I me after I get done I'll go back and try to give you a quick highlight and an appreciation for making the donation all right the Samarian Kings list translation in the following translation uh we're going to be going over the Sumerian Kings list located in the Oshi Museum in Oxford England and it begins here after the kingship descended from Heaven they're talking about kingship used to be in heaven now in these ancient references where you see Heaven they're not talking about heaven where the pearly white gates are they're talking about heaven as meaning above the Earth and everywhere you see the word Heaven they're talking about these kingdoms that exist outside of Earth's atmosphere they're not talking about the pearly white Gates that everybody's fantasizing about after the kingship had descended from Heaven meaning that kingship was being ruled from space not from the planet itself and we know that the Samaran God anuu who was the head God at one point he didn't like coming down to the planet's surface he preferred to rule from the sky after the kingship descended from Heaven kingship was in idog in idog Alim became king he ruled for 28,800 years let me say that again in aidog alulim that's the guy's name alulim became king he ruled for 28,800 years think about that they record these years in chars a Char is 3600 years his total amount of years combined according to these people was 28,800 one man that's just the time he ruled how about how long did he actually live they had access to monatomic gold collodial silver the the elixir of life that they always talk about in these tablets they knew how to transfer their mind from one body to the next they knew how to create clones of their own body in something called the halls of amenti in Rejuvenation Chambers and transfer from body to body living amongst men but unlike men giving the impression to the people that they were Eternal that they were Immortal then what happens alajar ruled for 36,000 years alajar rued for 36,000 years two kings they ruled for 64,800 years in one city called idog so first Alim rued for 28,800 almost 30k and then here comes alajar he said look man I'll take over for you I got you back I'll rule for another 36,000 okay the two kings they rued for 64,800 years then erid Doug fell and the kingship was taken to batera in batera nman Luana ruled for 43,200 years one person 43,200 they didn't have the telr capped their telr aren't capped we know that there was a genetic mutation to mankind around 200,000 years ago where tele number uh well chromosome number two was taken out fused together and two teler caps were put on this this chromosome one on each side and the telare was caps meaning once it runs out of genetic buffer material you begin the death process well we know for a fact that prior to that there's recordings of humans Homo sapiens like us and which I'm going to talk about tonight living for way more than 60 70 80 years but with the cap the maximum lifespan is 120 years and what did they find out at Harvard University the maximum lifespan of a human being under the most pristine conditions in health is about 120 years even Star Trek copied that same thing because they've got the right conditions there in that particular Century so the maximum lifespan of a human being in the Star Trek series is 120 years because they they know about this stuff they put it into Hollywood to make you to make you think it's uh incredible but it's just facts that's incredible so now we know that he ruled for 43,200 years enmen galana ruled for 28,800 years deid the shepherd ruled for 36,000 years in one city they ruled this long three kings they ruled for 108,000 years then B toera fell which means the end of that it was the end of that rank rain somebody else had to take over in some other place and the kingship was taken to zir in zir enand Durana became king he ruled for 21,000 years one king he ruled for 21,000 years then zir fell and the kingship was taken to cpog and Cog ubar tutu became king and he ruled for 18,000 600 years one king he ruled for 18,600 years in five cities eight Kings ruled for 241,000 years then the flood swept over the land so this is all what happened before the great flood how come that didn't make it into your [Laughter] Bible how come that didn't make it in because these people weren't Homo sapiens sapien that's why they didn't make it in they didn't want you to know that people came here that looked like us but that really weren't weren't quite us that not only not only did they come here but they developed a breakaway civilization on Earth and they ruled here they ruled here how come that's not in Bible study didn't make it into the Quran or anything I don't know what's going on here what happened I thought this is this is important information we got a physical tablet a lot of the stuff that's in those books you'd have no evidence of anything just a whole bunch of people talking off the dome but here you have a physical actual piece of evidence and then we can track back and we know where these cities were real and they're trying to say the Earth is 5 to 6 th000 years old like you kidding me are you kidding me come on we got to do better now the flood swept over the land so what happened was after the flood swept over the land they said H we got to change this up now now first of all when this flood came this was a situation that was even talked about in the anal tablets of th where there was a global flood as a matter of fact in The Emerald Tablets of th which is I talk about in my book compendium of the emerald tablets you can get it on Amazon or forbidden knowledge.com it's a bestseller by the way it's the number one bestseller with out of three million books in ancient civilizations for four years um th in the opening scene is talking to his father about the flood is finally beginning to subside and that the Russia fountains have slowed down and that Ancient Temple are coming up out of the mud and his dad tells him to get a crew together and go to the land of chem and rebuild civilization he said rebuild okay somebody want to know if we can drop the link so they can read along with it I'm going to drop the link in the live chat thank you uh Lon James I dropped a link to you from where I'm reading from so you can have a copy of as well I just dropped it in the live chat okay appreciate you thank you Ashley Nicole long and thank you anybody else who made a donation I just haven't seen it yet but I'm going to try to give you guys a little representation towards the end of this talk okay so we know that this flood is real and we have a flood account in every single civilization on every continent from every ancient culture on the planet I believe there were potentially more than just one flood some were Regional some were Global we're talking about a massive flood and in the Maran tablets according to the tablets this the the reason for the flood could have been stopped but and liil was so disgusted with human beings if you read the Epic of Gilgamesh and the Epic of atrasis he was so disgusted he wanted to wipe out the creation and begin a new start over not that he had created human beings from scratch but that they they had genetically modified us to do the work for them I talked about this in a previous video on this account you look at my previous podcast about the Epic of arrais and so he was like let's wipe him out and start fresh and his relatives iny and andag and everyone else they were pissed they were like wailing to please don't do this and but he was the king at the time so he had the right to allow this to happen and he did and so what anky did was he contacted some of his people on Earth and said look uh there's a situation about to go down and I need you guys to be prepared for this so I'm going to give you these floor plans and I need you to I need you to build this structure I can't do it for you because I'm going look it's going to look really suspect if I do it but I'm GNA give you these instructions and allow you to go ahead and if you do if you listen to me you'll Escape This calamity so he went to zra AKA Noah in the Bible but he's really his name is zidra and he gave him the plans on how to how to build an arc and this Arc wasn't the shape that's described that in of in the Bible it wasn't the shape of the one described in the Bible it is actually the shape of a disc and the this tablet has been discovered it was discovered about four and a half years ago and it's now public knowledge just look for uh the Arc of zidra stone tablet discovered Google it you'll find it and it was car cut up into sections like a pie on the inside and he was his instructions were to get gather up his local flock and any local animals in FL Flora that was in the area and take on the ark with him of course with some uh some meals and so forth and some water and everything else right not to get two of every kind from from around the planet two cockroaches and two fleas and two lizards and two false information fake news didn't happen and we have the physical tablet we have the physical evidence of the tablet which gave the instructions on what to build there was a disc almost looking like a UFO shape not a big giant boat that they've been teaching y'all for generations and generations fake news it's fake news they taught you a bunch of Lies it's a disc and we have the evidence we have the physical evidence how how come that's not how come the Bible hasn't been Rewritten now come hasn't been Rewritten God anyway so after the flood had swept over and the kingship had descended from Heaven the kingship was in Kick in Kick jur became king he ruled for 1,00 years this is interesting Kiana Bell ruled for 960 years then it says nanic liima ruled for 670 years and taraana ruled for 420 years and three months and three and a half days now this is interesting if you're going to fabricate a story like this why do you give the name of a person the location that they ruled and say that not only the years but then say three months and then three and a half days why give such an exact time period when you have to now etch all of this into stone do you see the there's no logic behind that the reason why this was done or why this was recorded is because it happened in Tara Anor ruled for 420 years 3 months and three and a half days and that was a woman so there's a record here of a woman ruling for 420 years in these tablets baboom ruled for 300 years then we have zuka uh zuka keep rule for 900 and you got all these you know broken pieces of this tablet so some of that you can't read and then you have atab who ruled for 600 years MTA the son of atab ruled for 840 years aroim the son of rued for 720 years itana itana the shepherd who ascended to heaven and Consolidated all the foreign countries became king and he ruled for500 years listen to this again this is very important itana the she Shepherd who ascended to Heaven he went up from the ground into the sky not to the Pearly Gates Heaven into space and what did he do he Consolidated all not some not a few he Consolidated all of the foreign countries he made one giant king om and became king and ruled for500 years how come this is not being taught everywhere when we have the physical evidence that you could put your hand on you can touch it you can taste it you can smell it you can see it we know that it's real we know that these cities are real why isn't this being taught anywhere I don't understand what what what's the what's the problem what's the problem because it breaks down Dogma it breaks down falsehoods it breaks down fake news that's why it destroys it this one tablet will destroy any Rel religion this one tablet destroys any religion I mean I can go on and on and on this thing is crazy look at this beia Balia I'm sorry Bali sorry Bali the son of itana ruled for 400 years these people understood the longevity of life and manuna ruled for 660 years mm kick the son of En manuna ruled for 900 years 1560 are the years of the dynasty of and manuna tazar the son of Zug ruled for 305 years IU ruled for 900 years itas it itad ruled for 1,200 years enm baraj who made the land of Elam submit became king and he ruled for 900 years AA the son of enman baressi ruled for was 625 years 1525 are the years of the dynasty of enm barasi 23 Kings they rued for 24, 510 years 3 months and three and a half days then kick Was Defeated and the kingship was taken to aana do you see the detail in this do you you see how intricate this is how much effort had been put into this information we got a bible thumper in here Chuck says Guy this is not true he has no standard of Truth Jesus is the truth the Bible has more evidence than what he's saying Chuck you need to do a lot of research Chuck you know why because the Bible is copied from all the ancient tablets that I've studied and anyone who is an expert in ancient tablets or have studied even the origins of the biblical text will tell you that the Bible was copied from ancient text and then remixed I'm sorry to I'm sorry to break down your belief system I'm sorry to rip it away from your core as you stand or sit wherever you are in this planet but you've been fooled was Jesus a real person yes but his name wasn't Jesus because Jesus means hell Zeus that's esus Jay didn't even exist to more recently so you're talking about hailing Zeus you're talking about one of the ancient Greek gods which goes back to an ancient Samaran god named an new number one his name is Yeshua so if you're going to believe in this person at least call them by their right name and by the way chuck if I asked you a question I bet you couldn't even answer it on this Al you love him so much what was his brother's name Where Did He travel from the age of 12 to 32 where was he when he wasn't in the biblical text where was where did he go people claimed to love this man so much and I think he was a great person personally I think his teachings were incredible I think his what he learned when when he learned the Egyptian Mysteries was also incredible and what he what he tried to teach people was that we are Gods walking In the Flesh and the power of the creators inside of us by the way but people claim to love quote unquote Jesus so much but they know nothing about him they can't give you any details they know nothing they haven't done any research on the ancient text they haven't translated the English version of the biblical text back into Aramaic they haven't read Hebrew and those of you who watch my book study Workshop saw me with Hebrew Aramaic tunia form and of course I've gone through all of these tablets and in the compendium of the emal tablets I give you the biblical verses versus the ancient text verses and you see that the Bible just copied information from the old uh the old tablets and text scriptures papyruses and cylinder Scrolls from around the world and then remixed it put their own little touch on it so they can approve slavery and dogma and killing and and everything else all right but that's many many many many many podcasts I've done on that so I'm sorry Chuck to rip away your belief system it's hurting you at your core that what you've been following has been based on ancient texts and tablets from around the world with a man I do mean a man's touch put on it to manipulate and control the masses you should watch my podcast could the god of the Bible be Satan it's one of my biggest podcasts on this platform could the god of the Bible be Satan I think so because I do believe in God but not the god that's in that book that guy in that book is evil and matter of fact he says he's evil because he says I create the good and I create the evil doeth I sayeth the Lord that's in Isaiah anyway let's get back to what we talking about come nobody could challenge me on this because I know more than Christians anyway let's do this so this text is really incredible because it's so ancient and this version of the Samaran tablets of this uh Kings list the Samaran Kings list in this tablet is copied from even an older tablet and that previous one was copied from even an older tablet and that one was copied from even an older tablet so we're looking at a copy of text that goes back who knows how many hundreds of thousands of years you're looking at some of the oldest account in the world of people who came from another place not from Earth and created a breakaway civilization and then began to rule over this planet it comes down to a point where they begin to give kingship over to humans okay it comes to a point post aluvial After the flood where they say okay there's a lot of people on this planet now and now we're going to begin to uh have a liaison between us and the human race so we're going to have a a a person that's a go and that go between is a person that that's going to be half human and half Anunnaki in this case these anunaki beings created in they created an Atlantean civilization so it'll be a demigod half human half anaki and so the original Pharaohs were Kings they were the Liaisons between these Gods who wanted to see their will imposed on the land and the masses and then that's when it gets picked up into from the end if you go through this whole Kings list right by the time you get to the end you say wow the the lifespans are really dropping or the kingship years are really dropping and by the time it gets to the end they begin to live live shorter lifespans so now I'm going to go and pull up some information on the Doon tribe let me pull this down here and pull this over all right so now this is me I'm standing inside of the Temple of SEI in a hallway that leads towards the Temple of Osiris or the oyan and in this incredible super ancient hallway on one side is the Original Egyptian kings list that's used to make all texts based off of Egyptian kings list pretty much in the world okay and so that's on my with me facing that way that would be on my left hand so uh if you're looking at the screen it will be to your right if you're facing away from the screen it would be to the left so looking straight at me though will be on your right side on the left side are U giant representations of the Nuru the ancient gods that came to Earth during the time of zepe and turned mud into a king om that's what they said there not me so for all the trolls and the people that's hating and why he keep talking about they got aliens in Africa I didn't say that they did they said the Nuru came from outside of this Earth and they came down to the ground and after the flood they turned mud into a kingdom the emerald t taets says the same thing when they saw the temples when th saw the temples rising up out of the mud they decided to go to the land of chem and rebuild civilization same thing same story different tablets different time periods same story I got to tend to go with circumstantial evidence okay and so that's me right there I've been there and if you want to come to Egypt with me and see these kind of amazing things then you need to click on the link and the caption of this video or this audio podcast for my 12-day super VIP private Egyptian tour my forbidden tour of Egypt where I take you to see things that you never thought you'd see before I take you to see things that no regular commercial guide is going to take you to see you're going to experience things in a totally different way way you're going to get knowledge that's forbidden not the mainstream fake news when I took that class on the uh the online class for to get the certificate in ancient civilizations from Harvard I had to make up answers not I had to not make them up but I had to give them the answer that they claim is the right answer which in my opinion is the wrong answer just to get the certificate think about that I had to give the answers that I knew were wrong just to get the certificate you're going to go on the Forbidden tour of Egypt you're going to get real knowledge and in October we're doing a 12-day tour seven days on the Nile stopping off in different ports along the way and going to see ancient sites along the way we have two brand new Mercedes-Benz tour buses and two brand new ships to sail down the Nyland and I'll be talking for seven straight days seven straight straight lectures during that tour it's going to be the greatest one we've done yet greatest one we've done yet it's going to be mind-blowing and so that's one you don't want to miss the link is in the caption of this video if you want to be part of the Forbidden tour of Egypt um and also you again you can go to forbidden knowledge.com if you can't see the link I'll try to see if I can find it on here real quick and drop it in the live chat for you uh so that you guys can uh upcoming tours and register I'm also doing a forbidden tour of turkey as well so I'll be taking uh some people to Turkey on a super VIP forbidden tour and we just got back from Cambodia on a mindblowing tour of Cambodia we hiked about 50 miles in the jungles of Cambodia and what a life-changing experience that was to go to all those ancient temples ankor wat to prom Anor Tom and all these other places so it was mind-blowing so I dropped a link in the live chat there if you want to find out more about going on the Forbidden tour of Egypt all right they said there's a little bit of a is there an audio lag or am I still on point here how's my audio going okay lag lag okay give me okay hopefully that refresh fix the lagging issue I should be good to go now all right you a messing around with us tonight all right so now I showed you the Samaran Kings list I showed you the Egyptian kings list a physical version of it and I want to pull it up here where where the heck did I do with that I need to read this um hold on a second I just had it up here I don't know why it disappeared on me let me go back to the link one second guys let me pull up this link because I want to go over this a little bit of the Egyptian king list as well um here we go okay here we go now so the Doon tribe back to where I was talking about so the Doan tribe the Doan tribe right now are in Mali Africa now what's interesting about the Doan tribe is they literally were the original inhabitants of pre dynastic Egypt or aka the land of Kemet okay they were the people that were inhabiting the land of Kemet and they were the people that had and still do have significant knowledge that has baffled scientists for uh you know 40 four or five decades now since they've learned about them and so the dogon tribe we can date back to at least uh there would be 7,200 to 7,300 years that they were already in Kemet before it was called long long long long long before it was called Egypt is a fairly new name it's a Greek name the land of Kemet okay and so you had Kemet and uh later on Kemet got broken up to Egypt and Nubia which is still really the same damn place but the dogons had a significant knowledge of the Universe And scientists were baffled because some of the knowledge that the Doon tribe had modern science hadn't even acquired yet it took them even some time to figure out or find some of the stuff that they were talking about they knew about a trinary star system located in Sirius three stars orbiting each other they knew that one of the Stars serus B had literally lived his full lifespan and ran out of fuel some stars when they run out of fuel they'll actually explode okay and turn into a supernova depends on how much mass the star has some Stars aren't big enough to go supernova like our star the star we have that we orbit and yes we orbit a star we don't orbit the Moon like these new I don't know anyway it's another podcast so we're orbiting our star our son itself is about lived half of it of his lifespan our son our son is is only got about five billion years left to live now that sounds like a long a long long time because humans only live for about 80 years 85 90 if you're lucky on average that's like a really good life right but five billion ion years is the blink of an eye on geological time scales literally blink of an eye in five billion years our sun is not going to go supernova it's going to expand into a red giant as the nuclear fusion begins to deplete and the heavy elements begin to deplete it's going to expand into a it's going to begin to lose its gravitational force of locking it down and it's going to begin to expand and as it expands into a red giant it's going to increase its size maybe even 2third of what it is now and it's going to swallow the inner solar system completely swallow it and disintegrate the planets Mercury Venus Earth Mars series C S Series that's the fourth planet from the sun that nobody talks about is all going to be incinerated this is why creating a breakaway civilization and leaving your star to go somewhere else and create a breakaway civilization is the norm for any advanced race of people it's normal it's not something special people coming here from another star oh man how why would they do that how could they it's normal we're the ones that's behind at any point at any given day in any given moment this planet can be destroyed either whole or in part in whole via a geological IC Disaster by what by things that we can't control like comets and asteroids like we have apus coming back in in about around 2036 we got all these other major uh potential calamities between comets and asteroids that are going to scrape by the planet then you have 30,000 nuclear bombs pointed at ourselves while we're still on the planet they're not here to protect us from outside threats they're here to kill ourselves while we're sitting on top of the planet itself with no Escape pods so it only makes sense to get off world to get off world and create a breakaway civilization which is exactly what happened here and we have the evidence in writing carved and etched into stone all over this planet itch into stone saying that's exactly what happened the Doan tribe what did they say you want to have pride in your ancestors you want to feel good about your ancestors well don't spit in their face then when they tell you that the Nomo came from another star named Sirius B and brought them Advanced knowledge of the universe they came from space to this planet and sat with these people and taught them about star systems planetary alignments they taught them about every single planet in our solar system the shape the size the color the orbital periods the equ equatorial uh periods everything going on within our solar system and beyond they had this Advanced knowledge and still have it till this very day they have this special ritual called the Ziggy where they put these masks on and they do these alignment rituals only when specific stars and planets are aligned in space and they do this with no telescope and they know about these orbital Peri orbital periods of trinary star systems with no telescope by the way Serius B can't even be seen by the naked eye on a great night because it's a failed star it ran out of fuel it became a white dwarf just like our son is going to become a white dwarf which is the point I was trying to make our son's going to expand and it's going to shrink to a white dwarf they even knew how much mass was in the white dwarf you see just because the sun shrinks down it doesn't lose its mass what happens is the mass is compressed and condensed so that one spoonful if you were able to take a spoon and take a spoonful of the mass of a white dwarf every human being on the planet together couldn't lift it the Doon tribe know this they've made that exact statement so they understand astrophysics on a level that we had to discover much much much later than them but they knew this 7,000 years ago what's interesting is when they got to Kemet it was on the rebuilding phase meaning prior to the Doan tribe prior to the great flood there was an advanced civilization there as well matter of fact that entire region forget that the entire planet was an advanced civilization far more advanced than we have right now we're not even close to tapping into what they had we haven't even scratched the surface of what they had what they were capable of doing even with the suppressed Technologies even those aren't scratching the surface of the total power and capabilities of these ancient cultures so when you hear the information and the knowledge of the Doan tribe please don't spit in their face and say they were just just making this stuff up and they don't and you and think you know more than them and most people can't even do their multiplication tables past a 100 and you think you know more than these people come on get out of here come on they had the knowledge and they still have the knowledge they are a rare part of the civilization I'm going to take a break on this because the Doan tribe never had a military police or a jail system because they had zero crime they would have disagreements and then an elder would negotiate the terms of an agreement between the two sides and that was the end of it and here we got militaries we got an Air Force we got an army we got Marines we got submarines and ballistic missiles intercontinental ballistic missiles and nuclear warheads and we got jails and prisons and and all that we calling ourselves civilized these people lived in a place during a golden ER era a golden age with no military no police no jails and knew more about astrophysics than we knew living in total peace and Harmony and we say we're smart because we can memorize our timetables and we can do a little bit of calculus and a little bit of algebra and we can we don't know nothing we still launching chemical propelled Rockets into space we know nothing so so don't spit in your in your ancestors Faces by thinking you know more than them because you don't and neither do I and so we know that unfortunately because of how peaceful they were another race came in from the area and was like you know what man these people are just relaxing in this golden age they just chilling they ain't got no worries in the world they focusing on arts and crafts and knowledge and and Phil philosophy we'll just take them over so they got pushed out and went out into Mali Africa where they are right now in Mali Egypt or camet whatever you want to call it has been overthrown seven times another thing that's before I continue to go into this Egyptian kings list another thing that people get inaccurate or wrong is thinking that Egypt was all One race for the whole time that's a falsehood that's fake news it's fake news see one thing about me I'm going to tell you like it is I'm not going to sugarcoat things and make you feel good inside I'm going to tell you the truth truth that you can look up because I always have the receipts Egypt was overthrown seven times by seven different groups of people multiple races this is why when you go to the Cairo Museum which I'll take you there if you come with me when you go to the Egyptian Museum uh of civilization which I'll take you there if you come with me you'll see bodies in there you'll see the mummies in there you'll see black mummies with dreadlocks and elongated skulls by the way you'll see black mummies with blonde hair you'll see fair skinned mummies with red hair you'll see mummies that resemble people of Persian the Greek you'll see even some that look Asian so why is this Egypt was a multicultural location in Africa even the last ruler was Alexander the Great he became a pharaoh there we know he wasn't black we gotta tell the facts we got to give the facts if you're a person that's believing that Egypt was black from the day it started until the DAT that I guess it fell and the aage moved in that you're you're being delusional you don't know what you're you know you haven't studied history enough I'm not coming down on you I'm just saying we got to stop speding false information and sometimes I'll post something on my anunaki account and the Pharaoh may not be black it may not be it may be fair skin like Ramsay's the second oh man that's not that's a fake mummy no that's not a fake mummy dude that's the real person we got DNA King Tut he was my color my skin complexion King Tut's uh King Tut's father was pharoh aanan who was a bit a little bit lighter than my complexion but it had a very strange head and a very strange body and so did his wife which was King Tut's stepmother not his real mother but King Tut's grandmother and grandfather uh um King tutm III and uh and U Queen T Queen ta had a big giant afro her the bust of Queen T is sitting right there in the Kyo Museum but then you go down a little further you see go up another couple din dynastic eras and you're going to find out the people look different it's just a a fact it's a fact of life we got to start running from it we got to start promoting the fake news yes there were black people in Egypt over time it changed up from race to race to race it just is what it is as Egypt was like I said overthrown seven times in history do some research and the reasons why the noses are broken off and the ears are off is not because people didn't want people to know that black people were in Egypt that's another big lie that's been out there for a very long time going viral and floating around and floating around non-stop when you come to Egypt with me you learn the truth that the the statues and carvings there that date back five 6,000 7,000 some even further back than that years thousands of years before anybody of any other cult cure or skin tone came there they're already off not all of them but a lot of them then there's two reasons the first reason is the most delicate part of these statues is the nose and the ears they're the first to erode they're the first to break when it falls they're the first to go when they take them down and bury them or whatever happens that's the reason number one the second reason is the Coptic Christians Christianity existed long before Jesus was even born the copics the copics uh were said you know what they kind of followed under aon's monotheistic ideas and began this whole new Coptic Christian thing aonan reason why he was kicked out of Egypt was because he started saying there's only one God and we're going to follow God so it was really he was worshiping am and raah but the people like okay well that's the only one then so then it turned into the god of heaven and it turned into the father God and the Lord and the copics took that and ran with it over time and then they was like we have to deface all the other gods because aatan said there'll be no other God but him so let's begin to erase this and so the people of Egypt they were getting pissed off at aanan because he was having people go around chipping away the faces he was that's King Tuck's dad King Tuck's dad who was a black pharaoh ordered this then the copics carried on everywhere where they would hide out from the Romans they would hide in these ancient temples and places and they would just while they were in there they just start chipping away because it was an insult to them it was demonic so they start chipping away all the faces of all these Egyptian gods and then then the tiu or aka the anunaki they would start tripping away all the faces anytime they came across a statue chip it away it was the ultimate in it would be the considered it was considered the ultimate insult and that's how all these faces and noses got chipped away you come to Egypt with me you get the real knowledge now I can sugarcoat it and I can keep the lie going and I can try to make a certain group of people feel real good about it and yeah you know and ah but that's not what happen happened it's just not what happened it's just not what happened and we have the evidence in writing we have receipts so it wasn't you know it wasn't what what you think all right so we kind of get broken up the first dynastic you know the Doone were pre-dynastic then we go into the dynastic era and it's kind of really kind of lost there's not a lot of information about the the uh the first dynasty the second dynasty of Egypt the first two dynasties are kind of really it's really tough to put it together you know and what we do know though is here's something interesting human sacrifice was practiced at the funerary rituals that were associated with the Pharaohs so why in the world would you be an advanced civilization that has high technology that knows how to build pyramids and use them for multiple purposes create basically creating stone functioning machines Obelisk that are made of magnetized Crystal Granite that can send information back and forth that can communicate electricity for gold plating and other things other uses because we have the goldplated items so we know they use electric gold plating so that means they had electricity thousands of years ago we know they had light bulbs and all of this and so now with all this High knowledge and all this you know intellect you begin to do now human sacrifices something's wrong here with this picture the sacrifices were done well that tells me something about these people people they weren't that intelligent you begin to discover that a lot of these sites that I take you to in Egypt are super ancient I'm talking about far older than you can even imagine we're talking about tens of thousands in some cases tens of thousands of years old and you begin to discover that by the time the first dynasty begins they inherited what was already there they built nothing these people in the first dynasty and second Dynasty built nothing and whatever they did build fell apart mud brick stuff it's a joke they inherited these megaliths they were there already when they arrived just like the Mayans built nothing and the Mex Mexican archaeologists will tell you this that the Mayans built nothing because they know the Mayans inherited what was already there they have records that the Mayans arrived in ton and chiita and Co and Koba and all these other places and the stuff was there already they just moved in and then they started doing what sacrifices they would throw virgins into Wells because they thought it would make it rain and they would play on the ball court and rip your heart out if you won same thing going on over here in Egypt foolishness dogma and foolishness why because these weren't the people that built the structures these weren't the people with the high knowledge at that time period and some weird way the knowledge was lost for a while you had nammer and whaha jur and jet and Marin and den and a anib and saket Ka sinera uh you know these are some of the king KS that they're presuming ruled and let's look at their kingship time that they may have ruled during this era 54 years 10 years this one they don't know 42 years 10 years eight and a half years 34 years you see the difference you see the difference big difference in time we don't really pick up an accurate account until we get to the king's list that I showed you I was standing in front of and abidos and we pick up around the third Dynasty okay I'm going to pull this down for you and um show you what I'm talking about here let me share my screen for a second you're not going to get this knowledge on no that nobody else's podcast and I'm not the most organized I'm not the most technologically advanced laid out but you're going to get the damn information I tell you that you're going to get some stuff that's going to have your head spin and make you think for a minute and the reason why it's going to make you think and have your head spinning because you know I got the information to back it up this is not one of one of I'm not on one of these off the Dome videos there's a lot of those out there or people who are just reading straight from the mainstream report I'm giving you onsite knowledge backed up by texts and tablets and recordings and hieroglyphs verbal histories you see there's a difference there let me share this screen you got it so we're going into the third Dynasty so you can see the kind of the Old Kingdom picks up around 2649 to 2150 BC okay that's BC if you don't know that means before Christ now they're starting to use BCE which means before current ERA so if you want to go before Christ add another 2,000 onto this number to get a real time period okay so you're talking about 4,649 years ago roughly all right and you can see we got the names of some of these Kings from the Old Kingdom in the third dast y zaket doer simet cabba honi senu kufu jere cfre nebar II going into the fourth Dynasty now manure and even these uh you know these people here in the fourth Dynasty in my opinion they inherited some of the pyramids that were already here and put their name on them so they put their name on some of the pyramids that's my personal opinion after looking and being inside of them like in the third Dynasty the Jer okay that's the bent pyramid that pyramid is a gigantic Diagnostics tool and it's so sophisticated I've climbed on the inside of that pyramid from the bottom all the way to the top on the inside and took people with me I'm in videos all over the place with the you know inside of this pyramid this guy in my opinion put his name on it said hey this is mine I I you know yeah we responsible for this I doubt it I doubt it could have been built in his lifetime yet alone the time he ruled so you can see fourth Dynasty fifth Dynasty sixth Dynasty then you get to the first intermediate period okay you got Dynasty 8 through1 then the first half of Dynasty 11 then you get to the Middle Kingdom and then it goes second half of Dynasty 11 you can see all these Kings here ruling Dynasty 12 13 14- 16 17 then you get to the New Kingdom era and now you're getting into the time of the grandfather of King Tut as you can see th most the third there Amo amoot is he let me see hold on is he is he th most of third or is he ammo hotep let me see hold on let me just check this real quick guys I want to make sure I give you the right information I could be off it could be one of the other let me just look real quick G to make sure I'm not giving you anything wrong it could have been Amma hotp now that I saw that name there just want to make sure yeah Queen T okay so I was saying th most the third but it's not th most the third please erase that from your brain is am aotp the thir once I saw am aotp the thir um there on that uh on this Kings list I realized it was Amah hotp the third not putos the third Okay so that's what it is it's Otep III uh who ruled around 1390 BC to 1352 BC that's King tutt's grandfather let see if I can move this up and highlight it okay that's King's grandfather Amma hotep III so he's all the way King to is all the way up into the 18th Dynasty well his bloodline kind of becomes recognizable I should say around then because some famous things happen when alaho up thei and queen Tay and then leading into eventually obviously uh what happened with him and his demise but all these all these Kings here what you can see on the right hand side their ruling periods they're not that long very short periods in kingship extremely short now we're down into the 26th Dynasty 27th you see what it says right here Persian the 27th Dynasty is Persian the 26th Dynasty is saite the 25th Dynasty is Nubian so in the 25th Dynasty the black kings returned okay they returned in the 25th Dynasty look at this the Macedonian period period Alexander the Great you know about that and then you even have the balic period so when I tell you that multiple people ruled over Egypt I'm not making it up I know what I'm talking about let me unshare my screen now uh I know what what I'm talking about okay when I tell you that there's time periods where civilization in Egypt itself has risen and fall between cultures and races it's a fact it's an absolute fact all right an absolute fact so yes there were black kings and queens but there were also Persian kings and queens there were Greek kings and queens there were Nubian kings and queens there were I mean you can just the mix goes on and on and on various Kings and Queens over different periods of time meaning different races of people over periods of time you can see them inside of these museums the bodies are there but the point I'm trying to make is they understood initially before the the great flood the Samaran Kings they understood the secret of longevity of Life they understood the secret of immortality through a couple of means like I said before the elixir of Life which included monoatomic gold and um and collodial silver along with a few other a few other herbs that they would add in there they also understood how to transfer their Consciousness from body to body through these many Halls of amenti that existed around the entire planet if you come to Egypt with me I will take you to one of the halls of amenti I will take you to one I will let you touch an actual Rejuvenation chamber you will see them you will feel them you will see solid diorite warped by an energy beam you can't warp diorite without breaking it it doesn't Warp but you'll see solid diorite warped you'll see you'll see a gigantic Rejuvenation chamber that's been warped by some type of an exotic energy field and you can touch it you'll see things that you never thought would exist on this planet that's what I do when I take people to Egypt it's a trip of a lifetime we do incredible things all right um and uh we have a great time by the way we have a really really good time as a matter of fact um let me show you this real quick let's see if I
