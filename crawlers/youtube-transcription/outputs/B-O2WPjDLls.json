His prenamen name includes higher glyphs of arms spread out into Scarum. The higher glyph of arms spread out is associated with the god Hecca, who was associated with the practice of meditation. The name of Hecca corresponds to the Chinese character Yuan. God Hecca corresponds to the Yuan god in Chinese Taoist culture. Therefore, the prenamen name of Sinusra'd I was Yuan Kong. In Chinese documents, he is mistakenly identified as the younger brother of King Taikong of the Siad dynasty. In fact, Taikong corresponds to Pharaoh Kancher, a minor king of the 13th dynasty of ancient Egypt during the Middle Kingdom. The ancient history of the Chinese history of the Chinese history of the Chinese history. Seemachin, the author of historical records, mistakenly regarded Taikong as the son of King Qi, that is, Pharaoh Hora Hora the first dynasty of ancient Egypt. This resulted in the loss of 1,300 years of the Siad dynasty history recorded in China. The lost fragments of this part were recorded peace meal and other Chinese historical documents. According to Chinese literature, during the reign of Taikong, the invasion of the Dongy people led to the loss of the Siad dynasty for 100 years. This corresponds to the 100th history of the invasion in rule of Egypt by the Hicksos people. Theimos was the last Pharaoh of the Thibian 17th dynasty. During his reign, Kamos launched military initiatives against the Hicksos, who had come to rule much of ancient Egypt. The prenamen name of Kamos consists of two higher glyphs, papyrus stem and scarab. The ancient Egyptian papyrus stem higher glyph was used for the color, green, and for vigor or youth. The papyrus stem higher glyph can correspond to the Chinese character Xiao. Therefore, his prenamen name can correspond to the two Chinese characters Xiao Kong. According to ancient Chinese literature, Xiao Kong expelled the Dongy people and restored the Siad dynasty. This is consistent with the history of Kamos, expelling the Hicksos and restoring the state of Ancient Egypt. Teticary was the matriarch of the Egyptian royal family of the late 17th dynasty and early 18th dynasty. Her name is highly similar to the ancient Chinese character, Maine.

She had initially ruled as region to her steps on Thutmosa 3. She was Egypt's second confirmed queen regnet. Her prenamen name corresponds to the Chinese character Finn. The bamboo annals book records the name and deeds of Emperor Finn, a king of the Siad dynasty. Thutmosa 3 corresponds to Emperor Hua of the Siad dynasty. In the bamboo annals, Emperor Finn and Emperor Hua were mistakenly considered to be the same person. This may be due to the overlapping reigns of Hechepsut and Thutmosa 3. Akhenaten, circa 1353 to 1336 or 1351 to 1334 BC was an ancient Egyptian pharaoh, the tenth ruler of the 18th dynasty. As a pharaoh, Akhenaten is noted for abandoning Egypt's traditional polytheism and introducing a tenism. The idea that Akhenaten was the pioneer of a monotheistic religion that later became Judaism has been considered by various scholars. Akhenaten and Nafirti seeded, holding three of their daughters under the rays of the Sun God at and giving ink symbols to them. Akhenaten's religious reform corresponds to the historical event of Kong Jada's ruptured the Siad dynasty recorded in ancient Chinese literature.

As he appointed his vizier pheromess as his successor, who would assume the throne as Ramesses I, who was the founding pharaoh of ancient Egypt's 19th dynasty.
