"[Music] 12 51 the age of the mongols the once scattered tribes of mongolia united through the will of a single man temujin the great khan have embarked on a conquest of the entire world that would carve the largest continuous empire in history on the 1st of july 1251 after a complicated succession crisis chingis khan's grandson munghu has inherited the throne of the mongol empire and sworn to continue the great conquests of his predecessors his ambitious eyes are now set on syria iraq and china [Music] during the first campaigns in china several powerful states were crushed by the mongol hordes the tangut western xia empire was the first to fall in 1227 after which its population was annihilated the mongols next objective was finishing off the church dynasty controlling northern china its capital of jongdu modern day beijing had already been captured looted and burned down and its population utterly slaughtered in 1215. the jin dynasty would not survive much longer as its final emperor once cornered by the mongols in 1234 took his own life nonetheless the conquest of china would not be complete until one last state was crushed the mighty song dynasty last ghan chinese nation still held strong with a powerful army and an impressive network of defenses despite its last few emperors becoming more and more disinterested the song dynasty was still very wealthy and four-fifths of its budget were now dedicated to its military ensuring formidable resistance to invasion from kharhoram or karakoram the recently built capital of the mongol empire munger sets out to pursue the work of his predecessors and conquer the rest of east asia in addition to fighting the song dynasty a few other states would have to be dealt with in the east the korean kingdom of the coriol dynasty against which several invasions were dispatched to the south tibet which was promptly subdued nonetheless the dali kingdom further south in the mountainous yunnan region remained if conquered this territory would provide a great base for attacking the song dynasty for this task mulher khan appointed an ambitious general eager to prove his worth this was his younger brother rubje better known in the west as kublai 38 year old kublai showed great signs of both military prowess and intellectual skills since his early adulthood in karakoram the mongol prince had surrounded himself with foreign advisors from all over the empire turkish and han chinese muslims christians and buddhists through his han advisors he also discovered china's central philosophy of confucianism to which he attached particular interests in addition kublai's personal faith leaned towards tibetan buddhism in contrast to the traditional tangiris beliefs of his fellow mongols after having been granted the whole of northern china as an appendage kumilai followed his brother's instructions to subdue the tali kingdom and left the mountainous yunnan region in 1253 the mongol prince initially dispatched envoys to request submission who were however promptly executed unfazed he assembled his forces and designed a three-pronged attack on the country alongside seasoned general urian kadai through his military talent kubila defeated all on his path until his army was at the gates of the city of dali subsequently local ruler dua out of resources agreed to surrender and hand over the city expecting a massacre the population watched with dreads the victorious mongol army entering dali however in an unprecedented event kubila ensured that all souls would be spared this decision unusual for a mongol likely came from his chinese-influenced beliefs of confucianism and buddhism kublai first distinguished himself as a more benevolent conqueror which was somewhat perceived as weakness by some of the mongol nobility by 1256 yunnan was entirely pacified and firmly on the mongol control with this edition monk khan judged it was finally time to conquer the stong dynasty once and for all in 1257 the great khan left the capital of karakoram for southern china to personally lead the campaign in his absence monger entrusted another brother of his the ambitious addict booker to administer the empire in his stead as kubila had proved his ability by conquering the dali kingdom month khan put him in command of the eastern army in 1258 for the campaign against the sun as he moved to besieged yauyu fortress unbeknownst to the conquerors the great mongol empire was living its final days of unity [Music] as kublai and his army reached the front lines tragedy struck during the massive siege of kyou fortress on which much of the song defense depended monkey khan died the mongol empire had lost its leader with this political turmoil and troop morale shaken kublai soon stopped his offensive and decided to withdraw all local mongol forces this unexpected victory for the collapsing song dynasty gave it the opportunity to re-establish peace allowing it to further fortify its borders as news of maung khan's death reached karakoram it was time to assemble or mongol council to designate his successor before kublai could return to the mongol capital in the hopes of inheriting his late brother's throne the council was hastily organized and elected his brother adipoca as new great khan instead perceiving kublai is too soft this decision would shatter the mongol empire in northern china and manchuria nobles opposed arik bokker favoring the competent kubila instead his chinese advisers convinced him to organize his own council in shangtu the capital of his personal territory built by han architects in turn kubila was elected as great khan in 1260 in a han chinese influence ceremony the monarch announced this date as the beginning of the zhongpong era a typical imperial chinese custom as the two brothers now had to compete for control over the empire the devastating tallway civil war would break out [Music] kubella's position was however tenuous in mongolia and yunnan where many mongol troops were still stationed allegiance was held to addict the song dynasty was rapidly regaining control over border regions presenting a growing threat in addition his territory of northern china was still heavily suffering from the devastation of early mongol conquests taking the initiative kublai assembled his forces consisting of powerful mongol cavalry but mainly a collection of churches han chinese kazakh and korean troops from the recently vassalized golio dynasty and went on to war against his brother at the same time he dispatched generals to take care of arigbocker loyalists in yunnan who were either crushed or switched allegiance in 1262 however the situation would worsen for the cinephile mongol prince as amidst the two brothers war over the title of great khan a subordinate han chinese official named litan rebelled against kublai's rule although this uprising was promptly crushed kublai's enthusiasm in the han chinese significantly decreased as months went by it became clear that addict boca would not be able to prevail since he lost more and more supporters he decided to eventually personally surrender to kubili at his capital of changtu in 1264 and was promptly imprisoned was now the uncontested great khan of the mongol empire however the tallweight civil war had left the nation shattered in several carnates largely independent from karakoram [Music] the empire's capital of karakoram had fell to ruin due to the war kubila's own capital of chandu was too small to become the new administrative center of the empire and ill place to be an effective seat of power the great khan therefore decided to relocate the mongol capital one option was evident three years earlier kubila had visited yenjing the former city of trungdu which had been the capital of the jin dynasty before it was plundered and ruined in 1215. the monarch was charmed by the area a few small ruined palaces were still standing and the strategic location between the mongolian steps to the north and the north china plain to the south made yenjing a particularly desirable choice after having repaired the palaces kublai decided to organize the rebuilding of an immense city and make it his other capital for this task he appointed han advail being drawn to design huge walls and plan out the future capital this new city would be baptized hambalik the city of calms known in chinese as da great capital small local restoration works had already begun after the destruction of the city but soon immense walls were built all around the settlement the great temple was built hosting ancestral tablets of many predecessors including tingish han for ancestor worship by the monarch a very chinese practice expanding chinese influence temples for ritual sacrifices and even a temple for confucius were also erected the great endeavor would go on for many years as khan balik gradually became the only capital of the empire shangdo slowly turned into the mere hunting lodge of kublai as well as an area dedicated for mongol rituals and ceremonies the great khan also aimed to reorganize the mongol government based on his own cosmopolitan entourage which had always followed him composed of turkic han chinese and other ethnic groups although he greatly valued the advice given by his han chinese advisors he needed to ensure the submission of the local population to prevent them from becoming too influent he refused to re-establish the traditional confucian imperial examination system which had existed in china for centuries instead kubili selected officials based on merit and personal recommendation besides from the general population the han chinese elite of northern china although talented could somewhat present a threat to mongol authority as had been demonstrated by leedhan's uprising in 1262. the mongol leader therefore began integrating the han literati in his administration however making sure to keep it away from powerful positions furthermore the population was divided into three social classes at the top were the mongols acting as the nobility and leaders of the empire the sur mor a chinese term meaning coloured eyes referring to west and central asians from the rest of the empire composed the middle class of the nation finally the han as well as churchians and koreans made up the bottom of society during the first years of his reign the great khan strongly centralized power in khan balik in addition to social and governmental reforms he encouraged the use of paper money another chinese practice and organized many tax exemptions in struggling areas to strengthen the economy peasants craftsmen and merchants were all protected through varied government institutions ensuring their well-being and flourishing science was also promoted as great scholars such as jamal al-din buhari were invited to chanbalik the persian astronomer reportedly brought the first globe to china as a gift to kublai's court and would later found the islamic bureau of astronomy main astronomy institution of the court for decades to come the whole military was reorganized under the xiaomi yen literally privy council rather than being controlled by independent generals this however brought the ayah of the mongol nobility and kublai was persuaded to create a separate system for mongol troops who by now were a minority in the very cosmopolitan armies he controlled with his state stabilized well-organized and prospering the great khan decided it was time to launch his own lineage on the 18th of december 1271 tinghis khan's grandson officially founded the great yuen dynasty it was named after a quote from the book of the yiting one of the oldest chinese classics great is the heavenly and primal owing to chinese tradition kumulai formerly claimed the mandate of heaven becoming an emperor the construction of the imperial palace which would take three more years was subsequently launched by divine right kublai and his descendants would rule over china the ren era was born [Music] china was however not yet unified in the south the decaying sun dynasty was still standing its citadel of xiang yang strategically guarding the whole song network of defenses had been under siege by tens of thousands of u.n soldiers since 1267 using usual tactics they had so far been unsuccessful in capturing it indeed southern china's territory made up of mountains and rivers including the strategic yangtze river was a great obstacle to the land-based mongol armies the river network on the chinese control further allowed the song to reinforce and resupply its fortresses and strongholds if the mongols wanted to defeat song china they would have to embrace new strategies subsequently in another move against the traditions of his forefathers kublai decided to indulge in river warfare for this new great endeavor the emperor ordered the construction of hundreds of ships using the expertise of chinese and korean sailors before long a massive 5000 strong mongol fleet manned by 70 000 sailors and marines was operational it would be the doom of song china by 1273 in addition to land forces and river blockades the mongols brought over a hundred muslim trebuchets from the levant unable to withstand the combination of weapons song resistance began to crack that same year xianyang which had resisted siege for six years fell from there the u.n fleet bringing its war machine sailed down the han river into the yangtze and would rapidly capture successive song provinces as local officials and generals were either crushed or defected to the mongols chengzhou fell in 1275 followed by changsha in early 1276. following his buddhist and confucian beliefs and wanting to avoid the devastation that the mongols had brought to northern china kublai firmly forbade pillaging and slaughtering of the population eventually the u.n forces finally arrived at the gates of lin-an modern-day hangzhou the capital of the southern song dynasty on the other side all hope was crushed five-year-old song emperor gong's regents his mother and grandmother took him to surrender and abdicate before the mongols and subsequently surrendered the city an imperial capital for nearly 150 years li nan was the most prosperous of all china at the time some song loyalists refused to surrender however and would only be crushed three years later in the massive river battle of yaman defeated once and for all song chancellor lucio seized the seven-year-old child emperor being and jumped into the waters symbolically marking the end of the song dynasty thus by 1279 all of china was united under the uyen empire since they were distrusted by the mongols former song subjects were integrated in the cosmopolitan empire as a new social class at the bottom of the hierarchy a distinction was therefore created between northern and southern chinese the former being above the latter the yuan dynasty stretching from southern siberia to the island of hainan would flourish in a spirit of openness kubila encouraged foreign traders and caravans to come to his capital of ghanbalik the mongol conquest by crushing quarreling states had opened the roads of central asia allowing traders to travel relatively safely and easily between china and the west in 1274 two brothers who were venetian merchants named nicolo and mafio polo arrived to hanbalik where the proudly standing imperial palace had been completed they had first visited kublai in 1266 who had at the time tasked them with bringing a letter to the pope in rome as the u.n emperor wished to extend his diplomatic relations with the west the two brothers had returned with several gifts from europe and with their son and nephew a 21 year old man named marco polo kublai was greatly impressed by this new arrival and would take him in his close entourage later appointing him to several official posts a proud grandson of tingis khan kublai would however not be content with his conquests convinced to re-establish the imperial sinocentric tributary system over smaller neighboring states the u.n emperor aimed to subdue all nations around china such as japan vietnam burma and even as far as the island of java in the last few years the emperor had requested submission from japan several times without success insulted kublai therefore turned to war once more and organized the invasion of the archipelago the first attempt in 1274 failed in which about 13 thousand soldiers half the invasion force perished seven years later a second much larger expedition was organized massing a hundred and fifty thousand soldiers and forty six hundred ships kublai had ordered his korean vassals to send naval experts soldiers and admirals after lengthy preparations in the summer of 1281 the u.n fleet attacked nonetheless fighting on the shores of kyushu rapidly turned into a stalemate and much of the embarked army was unable to land furthermore in an unprecedented event an immense typhoon broke out and swept the un invasion fleet with a casualty rate of about 75 percent the conquest of japan was definitively abandoned the japanese saved by the meteorological event unusual for that time of year were convinced they had been deliberately protected by the gods baptizing the typhoon kamikaze divine wind [Music] the golden days of the yuen emperor had come to an end that same year kublai's wife chaby died much more than a simple consult she had been a great advisor and indeed a friend to kublai this loss apparently greatly affected the monarch whose health faltered furthermore his eldest surviving son and crown prince gentin a widely respected and competent figure educated by confucian scholars died prematurely in 1286 jensen's third son the 20 year old tomorrow subsequently became the new crown prince military conquests during this period also still limited success an expedition to subdue vietnam in 1284 led by kublai's ninth son tohon although initially going very well was repelled within a few months the subsequent invasion in 1287 also ended in humiliating retreat which led kublai to banish his defeated son from khan balik nonetheless the vietnamese states of taipei would later accept to become tributaries of the yuan dynasty to remain at peace the mongols were militarily successful against the khmer empire which became a vassal state of the un by 1285. furthermore burma was conquered in 1287 after which it would have to pay tribute too to the image of the previous han chinese dynasties the cynicised mongol yuen empire had effectively established a sino-centric tributary system the abandoning of traditions of the mongolian steppe in favour of a chinese way of ruling did however not sit well with many in the mongol nobility the very same year mongol prince nyam a descendant of tsinghis khan's youngest brother based in manchuria openly rebelled against his distant cousin the emperor although now 72 years old kublai went to lead his army into manchuria and attacked nyan's position the rebelling mongol prince's army was crushed and he was promptly executed in the months that followed a few minor rebellions stemming from nyan's example broke out but they were all easily put to an end restoring order to the u.n empire this would however be the last expedition of the emperor the loss of his wife and favorite son had taken an immense toll on his morale and he had by now lost interest in most state affairs preferring to eat and drink in excessive amounts this lifestyle however only caused kublai's health to plummet on the 18th of february 1294 the 78 year old great khan of the mongol empire and first yuan emperor died in his imperial palace of hanbalik his grandson 28 year old crown prince tomor was soon enthroned as his successor in 22 years of existence the young chinese-like mongol yuen dynasty was an extremely prosperous and cosmopolitan empire tributes from many subjugated states came each year trade by land and sea was booming chinese korean tibetan turkic persian and mongol populations lived together though under a strict social hierarchy buddhism islam christianity and many other religions co-existed with little animosity the once devastated lands of china ravaged by horrifically violent conquests were now prospering assisted by many advisors young and pratomur was now
