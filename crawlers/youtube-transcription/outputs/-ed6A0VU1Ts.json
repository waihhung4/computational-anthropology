"[Music] so [Music] [Applause] [Music] it was a mysterious land that glittered in the midst of history the first light of human civilization appeared there it was a turbulent place with frequent changes of regime while china stands in the east of eurasia this place stood in the west of eurasia they witnessed each other's development over 6 000 years of time it was called babylon [Music] it was built on many layers of giant platforms and a temple stood on the top platform a spiral stairway led to the top of the tower the tower's base was about 90 meters long and wide and the tower was about 90 meters high over 2400 years ago in his masterpiece histories ancient greek historian herodotus recorded in detail this man-made miracle which was constructed four thousand years ago it was the tower of babel mankind's most spectacular architectural achievement of its time [Music] it stood on the mesopotamian plane mesopotamia is greek for the land between two rivers which are the tigris and the euphrates this land gave birth to the earliest known city civilization [Music] in the summer of 2008 the exhibition of west asia civilization was held in the louvre museum cultural relics of ancient west asia collected by many european museums were gathered and displayed in the louvre for the first time many paintings displayed at the exhibition were based on the tower of babel we can see from this that the tower had a far-reaching influence on western artists and even western societies there's an important story centered on this tower which is part of the foundation of western culture according to genesis in the old testament at one time all men and women spoke the same language but they flaunted their power and tried to build a tower reaching up to heaven their behavior challenged the authority of god so god confounded their language so that they could no longer communicate with one another this led to the end of the construction of this tower men and women speaking different languages were scattered in different parts of the world it is a fable that's been passed down for almost three thousand years god's rage became the beginning of mankind's misfortune cultural differences and conflicts hindered the development of human society in the western world the tower of babel is a synonym of reestablishing trust understanding and communication [Music] [Music] at the other end of eurasia xu bing a chinese artist has been seeking an art proposition about understanding and communication through his works he is sensitive to human languages so the idea of a universal language gradually formed in his mind [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign shu's creative inspiration originated from his devotion to language and understanding of different cultures p o e m this can be seen in his book from the sky which nobody could understand his introduction to new english calligraphy which could be understood and copied by western people and his book from the ground which he is still working on he hopes that different cultures and languages can be linked up perfectly through his continuous artistic creation in the west asia exhibition hall at the louvre museum are many cultural relics and artworks created several thousand years ago it's hard to imagine that this exhibition hall with limited space contains the most resplendent pages of early human civilization [Music] some say human beings originated in the garden of eden some believe that the first light of human civilization appeared there [Music] some say this was a turbulent place with frequent changes of regime it was babylon in mesopotamia west asia [Applause] seven thousand years ago when most people still live by fishing and hunting people in this place had already developed a sophisticated irrigation system they also had a mature calendar 4 000 years ago which divided a year into 12 months a week into 7 days and an hour into 60 minutes this is where the first city school library epic and civic code in human history appeared [Music] cuneiform script the earliest writing system in the world was also born here mesopotamia system [Music] the ancient chinese carved characters on expensive tortoise shells with knives but the instruments for cuneiform script were clay and reeds which could be found anywhere in mesopotamia modern scholars believe that the writing systems at the beginning of different human civilizations differed in terms of form and functioning [Music] foreign there was a saying in ancient china that the most important things for a country were making sacrifices and military affairs the oracle bone script was used in sacrificial rites people carved characters on tortoise shells so they could connect with heaven and earth and seek a mysterious power [Music] um script of west asia was used mainly for practical purposes archaeological findings show that cuneiform script on clay tablets of west asia was mostly practical recording accounts lawsuits contracts and so on today communication barriers still exist between the western and eastern worlds maybe this is because they have taken different roads from the very beginning [Music] foreign try creating nobody [Music] babylon means the gate of god standing on the vast land between the euphrates river and the tigris river this mysterious country glittered in the midst of history this land covered today's iraq and the surrounding areas [Music] [Music] today it seems that there's only heat drought and endless battles on this land but this land gave birth to the earliest known human civilization in the summer of 1842 the sun roasted the west asia plain there was an archaeological breakthrough in west asia that year a french consul named botte and his archaeological team discovered the ruins of a huge palace on a bank of the tigris river it was later proved that this royal palace had belonged to sargon the famous king of assyria borta became the first modern person to dig at the legendary palace of assyria [Music] the historical relics excavated by bota was soon transported to france in 1847 these treasures were acquired by the louvre museum the french people built the museum of assyria the predecessor of the louvres department of near eastern antiquities may the blood of our enemy flow through the valley like springs let's chop their heads off and pile them up in front of the city wall of our enemy just as we pile up millet these words carved on the monument of an assyrian king describe a ruthless period of history in ancient times the west asia plain was a fertile and treasured land with plenty of water and lush grass and the surrounding tribes [Music] regime changes occurred frequently and battles went on and on [Music] ravished by time almost all these sculptures of ancient west asia are incomplete but their remaining body parts and their glaring eyes seem to reveal some deep concern and fear [Music] according to the records of that time wealthy and privileged women living in palaces and big houses carefully moisturized their fingers in the morning and at night even as their country was being conquered their fathers and brothers were killed in battle and they were forced to go to the riverbanks to cut reeds their delicate fingers were soon scratched and they left their blood on the reeds those were the marks of their past glory sumerians acadians hittites assyrians chaldeans and persians many ethnic groups fought in battle over four thousand years warfare continued on the west asia plain plunging the people into misery and suffering conquering others became the purpose of their lives and battles became entertainment for kings this is the earliest monument in the louvre museum's west asian collection it was dedicated to naram sin this king wore an oxhorn shaped helmet which according to sumerian legend could only be worn by gods he is marching on the mountain road trampling the bodies of his enemy underfoot behind him his brave soldiers look up at him in reverence [Music] all kings dreamed of expanding their territory and leaving a good name for posterity the kings of the west asia plain were no exception they had many monuments built celebrating their achievements three thousand eight hundred years ago hammurabi the king of babylon had a stone monument built what's special about it is that this stone monument pushed west asian civilization into an unprecedented golden age be [Music] this is the most important exhibit in the lutheran museum's department of near eastern antiquities [Music] the monument is made of black bay salt the man on the left is hammurabi the most famous king of ancient babylon the old man sitting on the throne is shamash the sun god admired by ancient babylonians the sun god is conferring the scepter which symbolizes the king's power over hammurabi this scene could be described with the chinese saying which is the divine right of kings will make the country peaceful and prosperous many beautiful cuneiform characters are carved on the lower part of the sculpture several thousand years ago these characters were precise guidelines for ancient babylon society and people's lives this is the famous code of hammurabi [Music] it is foreign there are as many as 3 500 lines of cuneiform characters including 282 provisions of law which have a very succinct style the promotion of the code of hammurabi made ancient babylon the most strictly managed state in the world [Music] [Music] um the code of hammurabi provides guidelines for people's behavior this code which had been carved onto the black bay salt was the first statute law used to rule the country [Music] [Music] the monitor of the computer the oldest cuneiform characters are connected with the icons in modern artist shubing's book from the ground in artistic opinion anything is possible in the future [Music] effectively foreign [Music] this piece of bronzeware is called the cherche cauldron and it was cast a few hundred years before the common era there is an inscription within the cauldron about a general named bor malfoul handling the case of a deserter according to the law of the time this inscription is precious material for today's scholars researching the history of ancient chinese law but unlike the western world the ancient chinese tended to govern the country with virtues rather than laws the great sage confucius once made a comparison between laws and virtues [Music] he wrote if the people are led by laws and punishments they will try to avoid the punishment but have no sense of shame if they are led by virtue they will have a sense of shame and will become good confucius believed that laws could only restrain people from committing crimes and that this just addressed symptoms but not root causes to cultivate people's virtue and inclination to goodness was the correct way confucianism stressed the cultivation of virtue and self-discipline it was therefore considered to be the guideline for self-cultivation and national governance by the ancient chinese [Music] in ancient times different human civilizations developed in their own way they advanced side by side without interfering with one another [Music] after hammurabi passed away mesopotamia fell into warfare again [Music] among the many competitors the powerful and ruthless assyrians were triumphant this country with its powerful military strength rose quickly it imposed suffering and pain on the people living in mesopotamia and soon fell apart due to the anger of the people [Music] then 2600 years ago the kingdom of babylon rose again nebuchadnezzar the king of neo-babylonia had a new city built on the ruins of babylon city this new city was even more magnificent and splendid it seemed that the past glory and dreams of babylon city had returned [Music] the people of the west asia plane headed to the new babylon city by the light of the sunset [Music] they walked in the main procession street 18 meters wide and 180 meters long it was the avenue of kings the high walls along the avenue glimmered in the light of the sunset rows of lions were painted on the blue walls their faces towards babylon city and their heads upturned at the end of the street was the grand ishtar gate ishtar was a goddess in babylonian myth it is said that she was a previous incarnation of athena from greek myth the avenue stretched across the ishtar gate and led to the city center there stood mankind's most spectacular architectural work of the time the tower of babel welcome to the center of the world in ancient times babylon city [Music] soon the wealth and power of the new babylon city reached an extreme and things began to turn for the worse extravagance and arrogance started to spread in babylon only 88 years later led by cyrus the great the rising persian army conquered babylon city and neo-babylonia collapsed later xerxes the king of persia was infuriated by the babylonians constant revolts he ordered that the magnificent city of babylon and the tower of babel symbolizing past glory and dreams should be burnt down [Music] so [Music] around 2400 years ago ancient greek historian herodotus came to babylon city at that time it was under persian domination and was not as magnificent as it had been in spite of this herodotus was moved by what he saw [Applause] in a book he wrote that in the world we have known no city was as spectacular as babylon [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] when neo-babylonia collapsed on the other side of asia ancient china was also caught in a maelstrom of battles but unlike the constant battles and regime changes on the west asia plane the chaos in china soon came to an end ying zhang the king of the state of chin founded the first united empire in china's history for the first time in history carriages all had the same sized wheels all writing was with the same characters and there were uniform rules of civic conduct china had a vast territory and there were different dialects and customs in different regions with its great military and political power the qin empire made it possible for regional cultures to merge together [Music] ever since then chinese civilization has always stood upright in this part of the world [Music] [Applause] in the louvres department of near eastern antiquities the exhibits bear witness to the six thousand year history of west asia [Music] the sound of war resounds in the air [Music] people may sigh for the decline of the civilization of babylon and at the same time are proud of china's thriving civilization nowadays battles continue on the west asia plain and it is still in chaos it seems that in our wanderings we are entrusted with the mission of seeking certain knowledge the profound meaning behind the antique fable about the tower of babel must be discovered by us [Music] in january 2010 in iraq 196 people were killed in violent attacks and 782 were wounded the west asia plane is still thick with the smell of gunpowder [Music] in february 2010 shubing was still working on his book from the ground [Music] his motive for creation was an exploration of communication and understanding [Music] [Applause] [Music] since the exhibition of west asia civilization in 2008 more and more people have come to visit the louvres department of near eastern antiquities [Music] many visitors it seems come in search of answers will this seated clark unveil mysterious egyptian secrets what kind of history and wisdom are hidden behind this renowned museum perhaps from the messages left by the two famous ancient civilizations we can start to explore their stories about life and death power and wisdom the cosmos and eternity [Music] so [Music] who [Music] the [Music] me [Music] i am [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] and [Music] is [Music] [Music] [Music] you "
