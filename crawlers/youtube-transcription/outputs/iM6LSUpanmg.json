"There are thousands of different cultures around\u00a0\nthe world, each one with its own beautiful,\u00a0\u00a0 fascinating, unique expression of what it means to\u00a0\nbe human. I truly mean that, wherever you're from,\u00a0\u00a0 wherever you're watching this there is something\u00a0\nreally special about your culture. I I believe\u00a0\u00a0 that to my core. Every person, every nation,\u00a0\nabsolutely everybody has their own story to\u00a0\u00a0 tell it's just it's just what makes history and\u00a0\narchaeology so endlessly interesting. Despite all\u00a0\u00a0 of our differences though there's one story which\u00a0\nis shared by absolutely everyone, our evolution.\u00a0\u00a0 Today I want to discuss what we know, but\u00a0\nmore importantly what we don't know about\u00a0\u00a0 the evolution of you. We're going to take a look\u00a0\nat the last common ancestor of us and our closest\u00a0\u00a0 relatives neanderthals and denisovans. We're going\u00a0\nto discuss the evidence for our African evolution\u00a0\u00a0 before moving on to when we left that region\u00a0\nburst onto the world like a invasive species\u00a0\u00a0 and the contradictory evidence that really\u00a0\nruns right through the heart of our ideas.\u00a0\u00a0 It should be well good. It should\u00a0\nbe well interesting, big thumbs up! Before I start the video, I do have to give a\u00a0\nmassive thanks to boneclones.com for providing me\u00a0\u00a0 with this wide array of hominin skulls that you\u00a0\nsee before you. I've been using boneclones.com\u00a0\u00a0 since august 24 2019 when I made a video on\u00a0\nparanthropus here. If you've seen any of my\u00a0\u00a0 videos on human evolution all the skulls have come\u00a0\nfrom boneclones.com. The reason I buy from them\u00a0\u00a0 is because these are exact replicas of specific\u00a0\nfossils that they (archaeologists) found.\u00a0\u00a0 These aren't just facsimiles ,these don't just\u00a0\napproximately look like a neanderthal. This is\u00a0\u00a0 an exact replica of a neanderthal skull, an exact\u00a0\nreplica of a homo erectus skull, and i really\u00a0\u00a0 love that attention to detail. That's the\u00a0\nattention to detail I try to bring with\u00a0\u00a0 the information in my videos and so that's the\u00a0\nattention to detail I like in the props that I use\u00a0\u00a0 for these videos. If you're interested in human\u00a0\nevolution, I know you're probably interested in\u00a0\u00a0 what they sell. I would probably own paranthropus\u00a0\neven if i didn't make these videos because\u00a0\u00a0 it was learning about them that really sparked\u00a0\nmy interest in human evolution and pre-history\u00a0\u00a0 and realistically it changed the course of my\u00a0\nlife. I love having a visual memento of that.\u00a0\u00a0 I love being able to look paranthropus boise in\u00a0\nthe face every day and and see my evolutionary\u00a0\u00a0 history in the flesh.... in the flesh? Not\u00a0\nin the flesh these aren't these aren't real But i love being able to to see that I just\u00a0\ntruly love owning these things they're so\u00a0\u00a0 interesting to me and everyone who comes into my\u00a0\nhouse always asks about the skulls uh it's just\u00a0\u00a0 a cool as hell thing to own so if that tickles\u00a0\nyour interest a little bit i suspect it might\u00a0\u00a0 head on over to boneclones.com There's a link\u00a0\nin the pinned comment. Link in the description.\u00a0\u00a0 Use promo code stefan for $20 off and\u00a0\nyeah big shout out to bone clones for\u00a0\u00a0 providing me these skulls to make\u00a0\nthis video as cool as possible. Usually when we talk about a last common ancestor\u00a0\nwe're talking about the very earliest hominins\u00a0\u00a0 before even the australopiths. The last common\u00a0\nancestor of us and chimpanzees. However,\u00a0\u00a0 today as we're really hyper focusing on the\u00a0\nevolution of homo sapiens, you and me. We're\u00a0\u00a0 focusing on the last common ancestor of us and our\u00a0\nclosest relatives, neanderthals and denisovans.\u00a0\u00a0 Who were they? When did they live? Where did they\u00a0\nlive? These are all fantastic questions that to\u00a0\u00a0 put it frankly uh we don't have the answer to.\u00a0\nHomo erectus was probably the first hominin to\u00a0\u00a0 leave Africa at around 1.8 million years ago and\u00a0\nthis left scattered populations of archaic humans\u00a0\u00a0 across Africa, Asia and Europe. Each\u00a0\none going about their lives, evolving,\u00a0\u00a0 adapting to their particular climate, their\u00a0\nparticular circumstances but also periodically\u00a0\u00a0 meeting, boinking, swapping genes, swapping\u00a0\nideas. Trying to pinpoint our direct ancestor,\u00a0\u00a0 untangling them from this really complicated\u00a0\nweb of relationships is naturally an extremely\u00a0\u00a0 difficult thing to do. Genetic studies\u00a0\nof five neanderthal remains from Belgium,\u00a0\u00a0 France, Croatia and Russia have shown that the\u00a0\nlast common ancestor lived at least five hundred\u00a0\u00a0 and thirty thousand years ago. But that's just the\u00a0\nthe minimum time. It could have been as long as\u00a0\u00a0 seven hundred thousand to eight hundred thousand,\u00a0\nmaybe even 1 million years ago who knows. So we\u00a0\u00a0 have this roughly 300,000 year period, maybe even\u00a0\nlonger, when they could have lived but exactly who\u00a0\u00a0 it was is not known. This time period is\u00a0\nknown as the muddle in the middle because\u00a0\u00a0 before it we had homo erectus after it we\u00a0\nhave neanderthals, homo sapiens, denisovans,\u00a0\u00a0 but between these two groups of archaic humans\u00a0\nit's just an absolute mess and we just have a very\u00a0\u00a0 difficult time understanding the relationships\u00a0\nbetween the fossils that we have found\u00a0\u00a0 and unfortunately as well we haven't actually\u00a0\nfound that many fossils from this key time period.\u00a0\u00a0 So it's really hard to answer these big questions\u00a0\nwhen we're just dealing with a few specimens. One key puzzle in this whole debate has been\u00a0\nthe site of sima de los huesos, the pit of\u00a0\u00a0 bones, fantastic name, in atapuerca, sort of\u00a0\nnorth-central Spain. 430,000 years ago this region\u00a0\u00a0 was home to a group of hominins who were living\u00a0\na really classic paleolithic lifestyle. They were\u00a0\u00a0 almost certainly living in their family groups,\u00a0\nhunting large game like rhinos and horses with\u00a0\u00a0 primitive wooden spears, and perhaps deliberately\u00a0\nbringing their dead to this cave. There's not much\u00a0\u00a0 evidence of occupation at the sima, it doesn't\u00a0\nreally look like anyone was living there. We also\u00a0\u00a0 don't see much evidence of carnivore activity\u00a0\nand yet 28 hominins were deposited there. It's\u00a0\u00a0 possible that these archaic humans, these ancient\u00a0\nhominins were deliberately bringing their dead\u00a0\u00a0 to this particular spot. Which raises so many\u00a0\ninteresting questions about their intelligence\u00a0\u00a0 and their society and and how they lived together\u00a0\nand how they loved each other, maybe? It's really\u00a0\u00a0 absolutely a fascinating place. These remains\u00a0\nhave been given the title homo heidelbergensis,\u00a0\u00a0 which is a a notoriously difficult hominin species\u00a0\nto define. Because we have this muddle in the\u00a0\u00a0 middle where we aren't sure of the relationships\u00a0\nbetween the hominins many fossils have been given\u00a0\u00a0 the title homo heidelbergensis but whether they\u00a0\ntruly are all the same species and deserve to\u00a0\u00a0 be grouped together is a matter of huge debate.\u00a0\nWas this group of hominins our common ancestor\u00a0\u00a0 though? It seems not. Genetic tests revealed\u00a0\nthat they were early or proto-neanderthals,\u00a0\u00a0 after the split between us and neanderthals and\u00a0\nfirmly on their side of our family tree. To be\u00a0\u00a0 fair some anthropologists had predicted this based\u00a0\non the similarities between neanderthal and the\u00a0\u00a0 skulls from atapuerca but it is always obviously\u00a0\nfantastic to get that genetic confirmation, and\u00a0\u00a0 to be able to really accurately place them on our\u00a0\nevolutionary tree. So as interesting as they are,\u00a0\u00a0 they are not a direct ancestor of homo sapiens\u00a0\nthey were not the common ancestor of us and\u00a0\u00a0 neanderthals. Let's stay in atapuerca but go\u00a0\nfurther back in time to around 850,000 years ago.\u00a0\u00a0 In 1994 archaeologists discovered the remains of\u00a0\nseveral people, mainly children, who seemingly\u00a0\u00a0 had been the victims of cannibalism. What can i\u00a0\nsay? Life was hard in the paleolithic. Sometimes\u00a0\u00a0 your ancestors probably had to eat children,\u00a0\nthat's just the way it went back in the day. These\u00a0\u00a0 remains have been given the title homo antecessor,\u00a0\nor pioneer man, and the best preserved of them is\u00a0\u00a0 called the child of gran dolina. This child (girl)\u00a0\nwas about 10 years old when they seemingly became\u00a0\u00a0 someone's lunch and the remains have attracted a\u00a0\nlot of attention because of the flatness of the\u00a0\u00a0 face. One of the key features that anthropologists\u00a0\nand archaeologists look for in a fossil to\u00a0\u00a0 determine whether it's a homo sapiens is this flat\u00a0\nface placed directly under the skull and, as you\u00a0\u00a0 can see this child of gran dolina, their face\u00a0\nis very flat compared to earlier hominins like\u00a0\u00a0 homo erectus and even later hominins like homo\u00a0\nheidelbergensis. It seems flatter like ours. So\u00a0\u00a0 was this child a direct ancestor of ours, a very\u00a0\ndistant ancestor of ours? Well again it seems not. Getting dna out of a fossil that is 850,000 years\u00a0\nold is exceptionally difficult but new scientific\u00a0\u00a0 techniques analyze individual proteins which\u00a0\nsurvive better in the archaeological record.\u00a0\u00a0 Proteins on their own of course cannot\u00a0\ngive us as much information as DNA,\u00a0\u00a0 so please bear in mind that this uh interpretation\u00a0\nof the results could change dramatically in the\u00a0\u00a0 future if we improve our technology. But\u00a0\nproteins can give us clues to ancestry\u00a0\u00a0 and it seems that homo antecessor was perhaps\u00a0\na sister group of our last common ancestor.\u00a0\u00a0 Living around that same time, a very close\u00a0\nrelative but not our direct ancestor,\u00a0\u00a0 not the common ancestor, not an early example of\u00a0\nthe homo sapiens lineage. The child of gran dolina\u00a0\u00a0 really illustrates a difficult problem that\u00a0\nanthropologists have. Just because a specimen\u00a0\u00a0 might share many of the same physical features\u00a0\nas us, it does not mean that they're our direct\u00a0\u00a0 ancestor. Evolution spins a really complicated\u00a0\nweb. So as it stands none of the remains from\u00a0\u00a0 atapuerca are on our homo sapiens lineage or are\u00a0\nthe last common ancestor of us and neanderthals. This is basically the situation across the\u00a0\nentire world. Anthropologists have been able to\u00a0\u00a0 exclude some examples and determine who is not\u00a0\nour direct ancestor but finding that common\u00a0\u00a0 ancestor finding those really early homo sapiens\u00a0\nhas eluded us, we still have not found them yet.\u00a0\u00a0 Considering what we're going to discuss later\u00a0\nabout the origins of our species in Africa, it is\u00a0\u00a0 very likely that the common ancestor of us and\u00a0\nneanderthals lived there. But the past being\u00a0\u00a0 so complicated, we do have to keep an open mind\u00a0\nthat the common ancestor of us neanderthals and\u00a0\u00a0 denisovans could have lived in Eurasia. After\u00a0\nall that is where our two closest relatives\u00a0\u00a0 lived and evolved so it's not unreasonable at all\u00a0\nto think that our common ancestor might have lived\u00a0\u00a0 somewhere in western Asia, maybe even in\u00a0\nsouth Asia, India. Our understanding of\u00a0\u00a0 this time period in India is not great.\u00a0\nWe have a lot of tools but so far no\u00a0\u00a0 human remains from this very early time period\u00a0\nso we have to keep an open mind that they they\u00a0\u00a0 could have lived in India perhaps. So\u00a0\nanthropologists are keeping an open mind\u00a0\u00a0 uh but nevertheless Africa for sure\u00a0\nhas a special place in our evolution Wherever our ancestors lived before 300,000\u00a0\nyears ago, it's abundantly clear that since\u00a0\u00a0 that time Africa has been the beating heart of\u00a0\nour evolution. This is confirmed not only by\u00a0\u00a0 the fossil record but also overwhelmingly by our\u00a0\ngenetics. There are key features of our anatomy\u00a0\u00a0 that anthropologists look for when trying to\u00a0\ndetermine whether a fossil is a homo sapiens\u00a0\u00a0 or not. As I mentioned earlier we have a small\u00a0\nflat face, this face should sit directly under\u00a0\u00a0 our brain case, we have a really distinctive chin,\u00a0\nand we have this really round skull. Globular is\u00a0\u00a0 the technical term, globby globby glob glob. Now\u00a0\nof course we have to bear in mind that there is a\u00a0\u00a0 lot of variation in how modern humans appear and\u00a0\nthis variation extends deep into the paleolithic,\u00a0\u00a0 probably even more variation honestly. So\u00a0\nthese aren't necessarily hard and fast rules\u00a0\u00a0 uh but these are these are the features that\u00a0\ncould indicate that a fossil is a homo sapiens. The earliest fossils that we could describe as\u00a0\npotentially being a homo sapiens and archaic\u00a0\u00a0 form of homo sapiens come from Jebel Irhoud\u00a0\nin Morocco and date to around 300,000 years\u00a0\u00a0 ago. So far five individuals have been excavated\u00a0\nand as you can see they do have this small flat\u00a0\u00a0 face directly under the brain case but this skull\u00a0\nis not globular. It's it's egg-shaped, it's much\u00a0\u00a0 similar to a neanderthal much more similar to\u00a0\nhomo heidelbergensis. Because of the shape of\u00a0\u00a0 this skull we can't consider them modern humans,\u00a0\nmodern homo sapiens but they have enough features\u00a0\u00a0 that we could consider them perhaps archaic homo\u00a0\nsapiens. A very early ancestor of ours. Over on\u00a0\u00a0 the other side of Africa from Herto, Ethiopia, the\u00a0\nowner of this skull lived around 160,000 years ago\u00a0\u00a0 and as you can see is very round very globular but\u00a0\nhas these absolutely chunking brow ridges. Really\u00a0\u00a0 thick, really pronounced and that's a very archaic\u00a0\nfeature you could say in our in our species.\u00a0\u00a0 As you can see from these two examples, humans in\u00a0\nAfrica during this middle paleolithic exhibit a\u00a0\u00a0 real mosaic of features. The evolution into\u00a0\nour modern form anatomically modern humans\u00a0\u00a0 seems to have been a really slow process that\u00a0\nhas taken hundreds of thousands of years.\u00a0\u00a0 This mosaic of features continues for a long time\u00a0\nin the archaeological record. A skull from Omo in\u00a0\u00a0 Ethiopia is very round, very modern looking but\u00a0\ndates to 190,000 years old. Skulls from Qafzeh\u00a0\u00a0 in Israel day to around 120 to 90,000 years\u00a0\nold and again are quite modern. I know Israel\u00a0\u00a0 is not in Africa we're gonna get to that don't\u00a0\nworry. Yet a skull from Iwo Eleru in Nigeria\u00a0\u00a0 has a much more archaic form, like Jebel\u00a0\nIrhoud. Has this egg-shaped brain case but is as\u00a0\u00a0 recent as roughly 13,000 years old, that's roughly\u00a0\nwhen this person lived. This complicated picture\u00a0\u00a0 of different alleged homo sapiens with with\u00a0\na variety of features is made all the more\u00a0\u00a0 complicated by the fact that we know that other\u00a0\ndistinct archaic forms of humans lived in Africa\u00a0\u00a0 at around the same time. Homo naledi lived around\u00a0\n236 to 335,000 years ago and seemingly is a much\u00a0\u00a0 smaller form of hominin. We also have this Kabwe\u00a0\nskull which is considered a homo heidelbergensis\u00a0\u00a0 and has, you know, really archaic features dates\u00a0\nto only 300,000 years old as well. How all these\u00a0\u00a0 different groups of hominins interacted and\u00a0\nwhat role they played in our evolution, in the\u00a0\u00a0 evolution of homo sapiens is not known. There is\u00a0\nsome genetic evidence that homo sapiens interbred\u00a0\u00a0 with an archaic human around 124,000 years ago\u00a0\nin Africa but it's it's a very recent study and\u00a0\u00a0 the implications of this result are not well\u00a0\nunderstood. Is the skull from Iwo Eleru a late\u00a0\u00a0 survivor of one of these archaic forms of human\u00a0\nor is it just that homo sapiens in this region\u00a0\u00a0 retained some archaic features much longer than\u00a0\nanywhere else? It's really hard to answer this\u00a0\u00a0 question because we just have one skull with\u00a0\nno genetic tests. So we have absolutely no\u00a0\u00a0 idea of the context that Iwo Eleru lived in,\u00a0\nthe context that they evolved in. The skull\u00a0\u00a0 from Nigeria is an interesting outlier though, in\u00a0\ngeneral what we see in the archaeological record\u00a0\u00a0 is a clear progression from egghead to tennis ball\u00a0\nhead. So what parts of our brain were changing\u00a0\u00a0 and developing that caused this change of shape\u00a0\nand what can that tell us about our evolution? Let's look at two brains, two endocasts\u00a0\nfrom our evolutionary history.\u00a0\u00a0 One from three hundred thousand years ago,\u00a0\nJebel Irhuod, and a modern human. These brains\u00a0\u00a0 are roughly the same capacity, there's not much\u00a0\ndifference in size but they have been reorganized,\u00a0\u00a0 they have changed shape. So what parts grew\u00a0\nand developed and what can we deduce from that? \"two features of this process stand out periatal\u00a0\nand cerebellar bulging. Parietal areas are\u00a0\u00a0 involved in orientation, attention, perception of\u00a0\nstimuli, sensory motor transformations, underlying\u00a0\u00a0 planning, physio spatial integration, imagery,\u00a0\nself-awareness, working and long-term memory,\u00a0\u00a0 numerical processing, and tool use. The cerebellum\u00a0\nis associated not only with motor-related\u00a0\u00a0 functions like the coordination of movements\u00a0\nand balance, but also with spatial processing,\u00a0\u00a0 working memory, language, social\u00a0\ncognition, and effective processing\". Clearly there is an evolutionary\u00a0\npressure an evolutionary advantage\u00a0\u00a0 in increasing our creativity, increasing our\u00a0\nperceptions, increasing our adaptability.\u00a0\u00a0 This might seem an obvious thing to say\u00a0\nconsidering the vast amount of creativity\u00a0\u00a0 we're surrounded by every day... like this\u00a0\nwonderful youtube video, the highest form of art. \"oooooh i'm an artist\" It is really interesting to think about this\u00a0\nbrain development though. This progression from\u00a0\u00a0 egghead to golf ball head over the past 300,000\u00a0\nyears is mirrored in the archaeological record\u00a0\u00a0 by an increase in creativity by an increase\u00a0\nin the sophistication of tools. The people\u00a0\u00a0 living in Jebel Irhoud 300,000 years ago probably\u00a0\ndidn't have no creativity, no symbolic expression\u00a0\u00a0 because we see, you know, engravings\u00a0\non shells from 500,000 years ago\u00a0\u00a0 that were created by homo erectus. It's not\u00a0\nmuch but it shows that these archaic humans,\u00a0\u00a0 there's something going on up there there's\u00a0\na spark, there's a creative spark. By 100,000\u00a0\u00a0 years ago, you know, we're starting to see much\u00a0\nmore rounder skulls in the archaeological record\u00a0\u00a0 and we see the development of really specialized\u00a0\nbone tools like this harpoon from the Congo. We\u00a0\u00a0 see in South Africa real great evidence for art\u00a0\nand symbolic expression from ochre and carved\u00a0\u00a0 ostrich eggs and jewelry made from shells. Moving\u00a0\nforward in time by fifty thousand, forty thousand,\u00a0\u00a0 thirty thousand years ago this globular brain\u00a0\nshape is, other than a few outliers, absolutely\u00a0\u00a0 ubiquitous across homo sapiens and the evidence\u00a0\nfor symbolic expression and specialized tools\u00a0\u00a0 is overwhelming. No one could look at the art from\u00a0\nthis time period and think that these were just\u00a0\u00a0 simple cavemen. Nothing could be further from\u00a0\nthe truth. No archaic human ever quite reached\u00a0\u00a0 the level of creativity and symbolism that we\u00a0\nsee produced by modern humans. Even though our\u00a0\u00a0 opinion of neanderthals has changed dramatically\u00a0\nover the past 30 years, you know, they were very\u00a0\u00a0 intelligent, very sentient humans, truly humans\u00a0\nyet they did not have this globular brain shape\u00a0\u00a0 and they didn't have as well a developed artistic\u00a0\nexpression. So even though our brains didn't\u00a0\u00a0 really increase in size this reorganization seems\u00a0\nto have been absolutely key to our development. \"um i am a glob globby glob\u00a0\nglobby globby head artist\" that's why humans are man\u00a0\nwe're globby globy artists. The genetic evidence for our evolution in Africa\u00a0\nis is overwhelming, it's almost undeniable.\u00a0\u00a0 Obviously everything is subject to change\u00a0\nbut this evidence is really overwhelming,\u00a0\u00a0 it has to be said. African populations\u00a0\nhave a higher genetic diversity\u00a0\u00a0 than anywhere else in the world and the further\u00a0\nyou move away from Africa the more that genetic\u00a0\u00a0 diversity declines. Now I don't want you to get\u00a0\noffended, or get hurt, or get worried, i'm not\u00a0\u00a0 accusing everyone outside of Africa of being one\u00a0\ngiant Hapsburg dynasty, there's plenty of genetic\u00a0\u00a0 diversity to go around. But this does illustrate\u00a0\nthat Africa is almost certainly the place that\u00a0\u00a0 we evolved in. In biology this is called the\u00a0\nserial founder effect. If you had a region\u00a0\u00a0 where a species evolved, that region is going\u00a0\nto contain the entire genetic diversity of that\u00a0\u00a0 species. If one group breaks off and moves into a\u00a0\nnew region, then that new region can only contain\u00a0\u00a0 the diversity of the group that split. This is the\u00a0\npattern that we see in the archaeological record.\u00a0\u00a0 Africa high diversity, outside of Africa lower\u00a0\ndiversity. We don't just use the serial founder\u00a0\u00a0 effect to discuss our movement outside of Africa,\u00a0\nit's a really key tool that anthropologists and\u00a0\u00a0 geneticists can use to trace human migrations.\u00a0\nLet's look at mitochondrial haplogroup L3.\u00a0\u00a0 A haplogroup is basically a a line of descent,\u00a0\na lineage that you can trace back to one person\u00a0\u00a0 deep in pre-history. So mitochondrial haplogroup\u00a0\nL3 are the living descendants of this L3 woman who\u00a0\u00a0 lived way back in time. The L3 haplogroup is found\u00a0\nwidely across sub-saharan Africa and interestingly\u00a0\u00a0 to this whole debate it is the haplogroup that\u00a0\nevery ancient fossil that we have dna from outside\u00a0\u00a0 of Africa descended from, and it is the haplogroup\u00a0\nthat every non-african haplogroup descends from.\u00a0\u00a0 Let me repeat that, that's worth repeating.\u00a0\nEvery mitochondrial haplogroup outside of Africa\u00a0\u00a0 descends from L3, every single one. If you are not\u00a0\nan African you are a descendant of this L3 woman,\u00a0\u00a0 who was almost certainly African. No ifs, no\u00a0\nbutts, no coconuts from Australia to Aberdeen\u00a0\u00a0 and everywhere in between you are a descendant\u00a0\nof this L3 woman, and even if you are from Africa\u00a0\u00a0 there is also a very strong chance that\u00a0\nyou are a descendant of this woman too. Stefan from the future here, quick\u00a0\ninterruption. I shouldn't have said no coconuts,\u00a0\u00a0 there are always coconuts with these things our\u00a0\nevolutionary history is not straightforward.\u00a0\u00a0 In this particular situation the coconut\u00a0\nis not whether you are related to L3 woman\u00a0\u00a0 but the coconut is whether L3 woman did live in\u00a0\nAfrica there is some debate as to whether humans\u00a0\u00a0 had already left that Africa by that point and\u00a0\nwe're in western Asia or maybe even south Asia,\u00a0\u00a0 India. If that is the case, if L3 women had\u00a0\nalready left Africa, that wouldn't negate the fact\u00a0\u00a0 that we had evolved there it would just mean\u00a0\nthat we had left earlier than we currently\u00a0\u00a0 realize. There's always coconuts, I shouldn't\u00a0\nhave said that there are always coconuts. Now mitochondrial DNA, is just a very small part\u00a0\nof our entire genetic makeup but this has been\u00a0\u00a0 confirmed time and time again. In 2016\u00a0\na study combined literally hundreds of\u00a0\u00a0 genetic tests to create a phylogenetic\u00a0\nrelationship of humanity. The pattern is\u00a0\u00a0 the same guys Africa is at the core\u00a0\nof our DNA. If that wasn't enough,\u00a0\u00a0 we don't just see this pattern in our genetics we\u00a0\nalso see it in the genetics of bacteria that live\u00a0\u00a0 within us. Helicobacter pylori, i think that's\u00a0\nhow you say it, is a bacteria that lives within\u00a0\u00a0 our guts and causes stomach cancer and ulcers and\u00a0\nstuff like that. It's really an absolute bastard\u00a0\u00a0 but nevertheless lives within us. We see\u00a0\nthe same pattern of genetic diversity.\u00a0\u00a0 Helicobacter in Africa, high diversity, outside\u00a0\nof Africa low diversity. This suggests that this\u00a0\u00a0 bacteria was present in the homo sapiens that\u00a0\nfirst left Africa and as a result suffered a\u00a0\u00a0 loss of genetic diversity just as us homo sapiens\u00a0\ndid. Which is really fascinating. I if you are\u00a0\u00a0 suffering from stomach cancer i am sorry, I truly\u00a0\nwish you a speedy and painless recovery, but it is\u00a0\u00a0 genuinely interesting that we can learn about\u00a0\nour evolution from that, that is crazy to me! So as it stands at the minute, the earliest\u00a0\nfossils that we could describe as homo sapiens,\u00a0\u00a0 archaic homo sapiens, come from Africa\u00a0\nand the genetic evidence overwhelmingly\u00a0\u00a0 suggests we evolved in Africa. That's a\u00a0\nhuge region though, can we narrow it down\u00a0\u00a0 further is there one specific place in Africa that\u00a0\nwe evolved in? That is a highly debated topic.\u00a0\u00a0 If we look at the fossils that we've already\u00a0\nmentioned, Jebel Irhoud, Herto, Omo, Qafzeh, plus\u00a0\u00a0 a few others Florisbad in South Africa, Laetoli\u00a0\nin Tanzania, Guomde in Kenya, there is a huge\u00a0\u00a0 pan-african distribution of these alleged homo\u00a0\nsapiens. I say alleged because not everyone agrees\u00a0\u00a0 on their classification but these are basically\u00a0\nthe contenders for archaic homo sapiens. The only\u00a0\u00a0 region where it seems like there's a bit of a gap\u00a0\nis west Africa but that is the least well explored\u00a0\u00a0 archaeologically so it is quite likely that that\u00a0\nis just a bias in the archaeological record.\u00a0\u00a0 Either way though north to south there is a\u00a0\nhuge distribution of these archaic homo sapiens.\u00a0\u00a0 Considering this distribution it might really\u00a0\nbe hard to find one particular point that we\u00a0\u00a0 evolved in. This is the same in the genetic\u00a0\nrecord different studies have come to different\u00a0\u00a0 conclusions about whether south Africa or\u00a0\neast Africa or west Africa or central Africa\u00a0\u00a0 were the original home place of our species but\u00a0\nagain it's just hard to untangle the genetic\u00a0\u00a0 relationships between these groups that are\u00a0\nconstantly mixing. I explained earlier that\u00a0\u00a0 a haplogroup is is a line of dissent from one\u00a0\nperson in in pre-history, well we can push that to\u00a0\u00a0 its logical conclusion, it's extreme conclusion\u00a0\nand discuss the two people that every human\u00a0\u00a0 on the entire planet is descended from we call\u00a0\nthem mitochondrial eve and y chromosomal adam. These hypothetical people lived around 200,000\u00a0\nyears ago. Let's say we found the region that they\u00a0\u00a0 lived in, that's not necessarily the birthplace\u00a0\nof all of humanity, these are just two people\u00a0\u00a0 whose genetics by probably absolute chance\u00a0\nhave survived until the present day. It's\u00a0\u00a0 not necessarily the first homo sapiens,\u00a0\nwhere they lived is not necessarily\u00a0\u00a0 the home region of our species. So to\u00a0\nsummarize even though anthropologists\u00a0\u00a0 and archaeologists are very confident that\u00a0\nwe evolved in Africa what we mean by that\u00a0\u00a0 and exactly how that evolution took place is\u00a0\nstill quite obscure and very highly debated.\u00a0\u00a0 It does beg one massive question though if\u00a0\nwe evolved in Africa ,when did we leave? 60-ish thousand years ago, if you're not\u00a0\nAfrican that's when your ancestors left\u00a0\u00a0 the continent. This estimate isn't based\u00a0\non archaeological evidence though, really,\u00a0\u00a0 it's based more on genetics. Remember\u00a0\nmitochondrial haplogroup L3? That\u00a0\u00a0 branch of our family tree, that lineage formed\u00a0\naround 60,000 years ago. Or between 59 and\u00a0\u00a0 79,000 years ago and puts an upper limit on our\u00a0\nmigration out of Africa. Certainly our ancestors,\u00a0\u00a0 your ancestors did not leave that continent\u00a0\nbefore 79,000 years ago. That stomach bug i\u00a0\u00a0 mentioned earlier, that divergence and their\u00a0\ngenetics occurred around 58,000 years ago and\u00a0\u00a0 other genetic studies have put a migration out\u00a0\nof Africa at around 55,000 years ago. So multiple\u00a0\u00a0 genetic studies are all converging around roughly\u00a0\nsimilar dates, let's say between 55 and 70,000\u00a0\u00a0 years ago, our ancestors left Africa. This is\u00a0\ngreat, this is all fantastic evidence of course.\u00a0\u00a0 There's one small problem though, archaeologically\u00a0\nwe seem to have evidence of homo sapiens outside\u00a0\u00a0 of Africa much, much earlier than that. As\u00a0\nI mentioned earlier, we know homo sapiens\u00a0\u00a0 were living in the Levant between 90 and 120,000\u00a0\nyears ago and a new study, hot off the presses,\u00a0\u00a0 just released, has shown that there were multiple\u00a0\nmigrations into western Asia within the last four\u00a0\u00a0 hundred thousand years. This region is right next\u00a0\ndoor to Africa though, it's just a short hop, skip\u00a0\u00a0 and a jump. In the north it is uh connected to\u00a0\nthe continent and in the south the strait between\u00a0\u00a0 Asia and Africa would have been only between\u00a0\nsort of 4 and 15 kilometers wide in pre-history.\u00a0\u00a0 You could see Asia just over the shore, you could\u00a0\nswim it, probably, if you're a good swimmer.\u00a0\u00a0 So really this south west region of Asia was home\u00a0\nto many hominins, many humans, many homo sapiens\u00a0\u00a0 during our evolution. Now it is very dry, very\u00a0\ndeserty, but there were lakes and rivers in this\u00a0\u00a0 region periodically and it's only natural\u00a0\nto believe that humans just were following\u00a0\u00a0 their climate, following the resources they\u00a0\nneeded, following the food that they needed,\u00a0\u00a0 and spent long periods of of our evolution in\u00a0\nwestern Asia. However, western Asia is not the\u00a0\u00a0 only region that we find very early homo sapiens\u00a0\nremains. Archaeologists found a homo sapiens\u00a0\u00a0 cranium from Apidima cave in Greece which dates\u00a0\nto around 230,000 years ago. Homo sapiens teeth\u00a0\u00a0 have been found in China. Their dates are between\u00a0\n80 and 113,000 years ago. We were in Sumatra by\u00a0\u00a0 70,000 years ago and the north coast of Australia\u00a0\nby 65,000 years ago. Those last two are within the\u00a0\u00a0 sort of window of out of Africa suggested by our\u00a0\ngenetics but they're right at the top end of it,\u00a0\u00a0 we really would have had to have dashed along the\u00a0\nsouth coast of Asia to get there by those times,\u00a0\u00a0 which is possible but still we have those remains\u00a0\nin Greece, we have those remains in China,\u00a0\u00a0 we have a lot of hominin tools in India\u00a0\nthat we haven't been able to pin on someone.\u00a0\u00a0 So how do we reconcile the tension between the\u00a0\ngenetic evidence and the archaeological evidence? The first possibility is that we have missed the\u00a0\ngenetic signals of these earlier migrations. In\u00a0\u00a0 2016 geneticists reported a previously undetected\u00a0\ngenetic signal in the genes of people in\u00a0\u00a0 Papua New Guinea that suggested that they had a\u00a0\ncontribution to their DNA of homo sapiens around\u00a0\u00a0 120,000 years ago. It was just a tiny fraction of\u00a0\ntheir DNA, around 2%, so they are certainly still\u00a0\u00a0 predominantly relatives of that later migration\u00a0\nout of Africa, but it is possible that we\u00a0\u00a0 we have missed these earlier genetic signals\u00a0\nof an earlier migration. However other studies\u00a0\u00a0 knowing that geneticists had come to this result\u00a0\ntried to to replicate it and and so far have been\u00a0\u00a0 unsuccessful. So at the minute it's really\u00a0\nup for up for debate, it hasn't been proved\u00a0\u00a0 at the minute that we have this genetic signal uh\u00a0\nwithin us from an earlier migration out of Africa. The other explanation therefore is that\u00a0\nthese earlier migrations of homo sapiens\u00a0\u00a0 out of Africa have not left a lasting genetic\u00a0\nlegacy, they weren't really our direct ancestors,\u00a0\u00a0 they weren't ultimately successful you could say.\u00a0\nThis raises a lot of questions. If homo sapiens\u00a0\u00a0 expanded out of Africa, but died out before this\u00a0\nlater migration at 65,000 years ago, why did they\u00a0\u00a0 die out and other archaic humans like neanderthals\u00a0\nand denisovans survived? If these communities\u00a0\u00a0 of homo sapiens survived until this later\u00a0\nmigration, then why don't we see more evidence of\u00a0\u00a0 interbreeding between these two lineages of ours?\u00a0\nEspecially considering the abundant evidence we\u00a0\u00a0 have for interbreeding with other archaic humans?\u00a0\nThat does raise questions, if they survived until\u00a0\u00a0 that point that is an interesting question. We\u00a0\nknow from studying archaic DNA within Europe and\u00a0\u00a0 early European fossils that we are not really\u00a0\na close relative to the first europeans anymore\u00a0\u00a0 that there has been a lot of population turnover.\u00a0\nSo these things are are possible, it is certainly\u00a0\u00a0 possible that these earlier migrations died out.\u00a0\nWhatever caused that expansion of homo sapiens\u00a0\u00a0 between 55 and 70,000 years ago to be successful\u00a0\nit's clear we absolutely burst onto the scene\u00a0\u00a0 we we kicked the door in we rampaged\u00a0\naround the world like an invasive species. We reached australia by 65,000 years ago Europe by\u00a0\n47,000 years ago the far northern coast of Eurasia\u00a0\u00a0 by 45,000 years ago, North America by 24,000\u00a0\nyears ago, maybe even earlier, highly debated.\u00a0\u00a0 Everywhere we went populations of large animals\u00a0\nseemed to die out soon after. We absolutely went\u00a0\u00a0 wild, there's no question about it. What gave us\u00a0\nthat killer edge? What allowed us to expand like\u00a0\u00a0 that at the expense of everyone else and to be\u00a0\nso much more successful than any other archaic\u00a0\u00a0 human, any other earlier migration of homo\u00a0\nsapiens? It could have been our technology. \"One reason why humans failed to settle\u00a0\nmore permanently might be competition.\u00a0\u00a0 Perhaps the presence of neanderthals and other\u00a0\nhuman populations in number was a key reason\u00a0\u00a0 behind this? I think this might be one factor,\u00a0\nbut not the single explanation. I think it is\u00a0\u00a0 more likely that before dispersing into the wide\u00a0\nrange of environments in Eurasia, homo sapiens\u00a0\u00a0 had first to develop a gamut of new and improved\u00a0\ntechnologies in order to survive and prosper\". 48,000 years ago in what is now southwest Sri\u00a0\nLanka, a group of homo sapiens called this\u00a0\u00a0 dense rainforest home. The rainforest really\u00a0\nis a is a very different environment to the\u00a0\u00a0 grasslands of Africa that we seemingly\u00a0\nevolved in. Even though it's very green,\u00a0\u00a0 very lush, it's not an easy environment\u00a0\nto survive in. But nevertheless this\u00a0\u00a0 group adapted. Archaeologists have found a trove\u00a0\nof arrows made from the bones of monkeys that\u00a0\u00a0 these prehistoric homo sapiens left behind. One\u00a0\nof the arrows even has lines engraved on it which\u00a0\u00a0 ethnographically other hunter-gatherers have used\u00a0\nto attach poisons to arrows. It's possible that\u00a0\u00a0 that some of these other bones were used as darts,\u00a0\nthat's another possibility. Technology like the\u00a0\u00a0 bow and arrow must have been a very important part\u00a0\nof their survival strategy, it's very hard to hunt\u00a0\u00a0 the small and agile game that live in the the rain\u00a0\nforest, live in the canopy of the jungle, without\u00a0\u00a0 these quick, fast weapons. The earliest evidence\u00a0\nwe see of bows and arrows in the archaeological\u00a0\u00a0 record come from Africa interestingly between\u00a0\n60 and 70,000 years ago, right on the cusp of\u00a0\u00a0 our migration. It's fascinating to me that this\u00a0\ncommunity of hunter-gatherers in the rainforest,\u00a0\u00a0 hunting monkeys with their bows and arrows, were\u00a0\ncontemporaries of the humans that were living in\u00a0\u00a0 the far north of Siberia, the far north of Eurasia\u00a0\nwho were hunting mammoths and huge game like that,\u00a0\u00a0 and living in a wildly different environment.\u00a0\nThese two groups of homo sapiens were closely\u00a0\u00a0 related, their ancestors had left Africa maybe\u00a0\nonly 15,000 years before. Yet one group went north\u00a0\u00a0 and adapted to the cold, one group hugged the\u00a0\nsouth coast of Asia, adapted to the rainforest.\u00a0\u00a0 This level of flexibility is only seen in\u00a0\nmodern humans, not in any other archaic human,\u00a0\u00a0 not in archaic homo sapiens, not in neanderthals,\u00a0\nnot in denisovans. They adapted by following\u00a0\u00a0 their preferred environment as the climate changed\u00a0\naround them, this later migration of homo sapiens\u00a0\u00a0 was able to adapt by changing their lifestyle.\u00a0\nIn times of climatic variability, we were still\u00a0\u00a0 able to expand, they contracted. We don't see any\u00a0\nevidence of neanderthals or anyone else producing\u00a0\u00a0 technology like bows and arrows, atl-atls, blow\u00a0\nguns they just seemingly did not produce them. This is honestly my seventh or\u00a0\neighth attempt at ending this video,\u00a0\u00a0 because I feel like I should say something\u00a0\nprofound about our evolutionary journey but\u00a0\u00a0 I just, I just don't know what to say.\u00a0\nI don't know what profound thing to say.\u00a0\u00a0 It's so hard because the point we're at in\u00a0\nthis video where i'm sat on this log right here\u00a0\u00a0 is about 30,000 years ago. Humans, homo sapiens,\u00a0\nhave spread across the entire planet. All our\u00a0\u00a0 archaic cousins have either been absorbed into\u00a0\nour communities or are dead. After 30,000 years\u00a0\u00a0 ago it just seems like they're no more and yet\u00a0\neven though we've been on this journey for a\u00a0\u00a0 million years by this point, this is the start\u00a0\nof human history, what we consider like the\u00a0\u00a0 upper paleolithic, the mesolithic, neolithic,\u00a0\non and on and on through time. The video ends\u00a0\u00a0 at the point where all of human history kind of\u00a0\nstarts. So I just uh i don't know what to say,\u00a0\u00a0 i don't know what profound thing to say so\u00a0\nI'm going to steal that quote from Winston\u00a0\u00a0 Churchill. This is not the end, it's not even\u00a0\nthe beginning of the end, but it is the end\u00a0\u00a0 of the beginning. Thanks for watching guys loads\u00a0\nmore videos on human evolution, pre-history,\u00a0\u00a0 our story to come there's so much more\u00a0\nto say and uh i appreciate you watching. Boop! "
