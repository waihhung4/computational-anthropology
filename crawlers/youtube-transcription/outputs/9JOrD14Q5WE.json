"the year is roughly 2700 BC around that time the Egyptians were building some big triangles in the sand the people of Britain were building whatever this is and in the East a new civilization was beginning to form one that would shape our world's history and one that continues to affect us to this very day no not that one oh my God I can't believe this blasphemy this is so stupid the Chia Dynasty wasn't even real it clearly says it on Wikipedia you are lying to your view of this I am about to go post this on our slash bad history you are a filthy CCP spy and this propaganda will not stand technically he's correct the existence of the Shia Dynasty and subsequently everything before them is at best debatable and quite likely to be a myth our only proof of this period existing is a historical record written in about 100 BC and something called the bamboo a these things nevertheless the story goes that around 2700 BC a man by the name of huangdi aka the yellow Emperor basically invented everything including but not limited to writing taoism wooden houses boats calendars bows and arrows carts and Chinese civilization he United his local tribes and formed the first ancient Chinese State fast forward a few hundred years and Emperor Yao was in charge of this state and he was facing a problem you see the ancient Chinese much like other ancient civilizations situated themselves along the best Rivers they could find for agriculture in this case the Yellow River and the Yellow River had a bad habit of flooding constantly and destroying everything so Yao decided to appoint a guy called goon to fix the problem after nine years of trying to build up dams to stop the river goon ultimately failed and somewhere between those nine years Yao gave the throne to a new emperor called shun what Shawn did to goon after his failure is not entirely known some sources claim goon was imprisoned for Life others say Sean executed him and others say goon offed himself by jumping off a cliff regardless goon was now out of the picture and it was his son's job called you to fix the problem with the river and you had a different approach from his father instead of building dams he dug canals along the river to gather the excess water and dump it into farmland and it worked so well that Emperor shun gave you his title instead of giving it to his own son dude uncool and so you the great established the first dynasty in Chinese history the Shah Dynasty and his first act as Emperor was to divide the known Chinese world into nine provinces around that time the concept of the Mandate of Heaven would become quite important the Mandate of Heaven is the idea that the rule of China is given to a dynasty by Heaven if it is deemed fitting to rule and taken away by Heaven if it is deemed unworthy a few hundred years passed during which the dynasty went through 15 different rulers all of whom achieved a grand total of zero remarkable things but the 16th guy who was called Emperor G was different he was a little [\u00a0__\u00a0] he would spend more and more money into ensuring a more lavish lifestyle for himself and his wife until it all culminated to him ordering a lake of alcohol being built in which they both sailed around in and calling for three thousand men to drink all of it only to laugh when they drowned in it I'm not joking look it up the people seeing all of this began to think that heaven didn't really fancy GE anymore so one of the vassals of the Sia Dynasty the Shang which was led by a man called Tang launched a rebellion against G with support from basically everyone and after whooping his ass in the Battle of Ming tiao Gia was deposed and with him the Sia Dynasty fell after 400 years of ruling China leading to the rise of a new Dynasty the Shang Dynasty that's enough for today see you soon "
