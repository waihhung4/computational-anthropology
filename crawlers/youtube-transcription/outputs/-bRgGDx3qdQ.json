" The Gilgamesh epic ranks with the Babylonian myth of creation as one of the greatest literary productions of ancient Babylonia. The main element in its composition is a conglomeration of mythic matter, drawn from various sources, with perhaps a substratum of historic fact, the whole being woven into a continuous narrative around the central figure of Gilgamesh, Prince of Eric. It is not possible that present to fix the date when the epic was first written. Our knowledge of it is gleaned chiefly from mutilated fragments belonging to the library of Asur-Bani Paul. And from internal and other evidence we gather that some at least of the traditions embodied in the epic are of much greater antiquity than his reign. Thus a tablet dated 2100 BC contains a variant of the delusory inserted in the 11th tablet of the Gilgamesh epic. Probably this and other portions of the epic existed in oral tradition before they were committed to writing, that is, in the remote Samarion period. Asur-Bani Paul was an enthusiastic practical patron of literature. In his great library at Nineveh, the nucleus of which had been taken from Kala by Senakarib, he had gathered a vast collections of volumes, clay tablets and papyrae, most of which had been carried as spoil from conquered lands. He also employed scribes to copy older texts, and this is evidently how the existing addition of the Gilgamesh epic came to be written. From the fragments now in the British Museum, it would seem that at least four copies of the poem were made in the time of Asur-Bani Paul. There were not long permitted to remain undisturbed. The great Asurian Empire was already declining. Long Nineveh was captured and its library scattered, while plundering hordes burnt the precious rolls of papyrus and buried the clay tablets in the debris of the palace which had sheltered them. There were destined to lie for over 2,000 years, till the excavations of Sir A. H. Layer George Smith and others brought them to light. It is true that the 12 tablets of the Gilgamesh epic, or rather the fragments of them, which are so far been discovered, are much defaced, frequently the entire sense of a passage is obscured by a gap in the text. And this, when nice mythological elucidation are in question, is no light matter. Yet to such, an extent has the science of comparative religion progressed in recent years, that we are probably better able to read the true mythological significance of the epic. Even where the ancient Babylonians themselves, who saw it merely as an account of wanderings and exploits of a national hero. The epic which shenners around the ancient city of Eric relates the adventures of a half human, half divine hero, Gilgamesh by name, who is King over Eric. Two other characters figure prominently in the narrative. Eveny, who evidently typifies primitive man, and at nappishdom, the hero of the Babylonian deluge myth. Each of three would seem to have been originally the hero of a separate group of traditions, which in time became incorporated, much more less naturally, with the other two. The first and most important of the trio, the hero Gilgamesh, may have been at one time a real personage, though nothing is known of him historically. Possibly the exploits of some ancient king of Eric had furnished a basis for the narrative. His name, for a time provisionally read, Gizhtubar, or Isdubar. But now known to have been pronounced Gilgamesh, suggests that he was not Babylonian, but Elamite, or Casite in origin, and from indications furnished by the poem itself. We learn that he conquered Eric, or relieved the city from a besieging force, at the onset of his adventurous career. It has been suggested also that he was identical with the biblical Nimrod, like him, a hero of ancient Babylon. But there are no other grounds for this suggestion. So much for the historical aspect of Gilgamesh. His mythological character is more easily established. In this regard, he is the personification of the Sun. He represents, in fact, the fusion of a great national hero with a mythical being. Throughout the epic, there are indications that Gilgamesh is partly defined by nature, though nothing specific is said on that head. His identity with the solar god is veiled in the popular narrative. But it is evident that he has some connection with the god Shamaosh, to whom he pays his devotion, and who acts as his patron and protector. The birth of Gilgamesh. Among the traditions concerning his birth is one related by Elian of Gilgamesh, Gilgamesh, the grandson of Sikhoros, Sikhoros, who according to Barosis, was the first king to reign in Babylon after the deluge. Was warned by means of divination that his daughter should bear a son, would deprive him of his throne. He seemed to frustrate the designs of fate, he shut her up in a tower, where she was closely watched. But in time she bore a son, knowing how roth the king would be to learn of the event, flung the child from the tower. But before he reached the ground, an eagle seized him up and bore him off to a certain garden, where he was duly found and cared for by a peasant. And when he grew to manhood, he became king of the Babylonians, having presumably up-served the throne of his grandfather. Here we have a myth obviously of solar significance, conforming in every particular to a definite type of son legend. It cannot have been by chance that it became attached to the person of Gilgamesh. Everything in the epic too is consonant with the belief that Gilgamesh is a son God, is connection with Shamaosh, who may have been his father in the tradition given by Elian, as well as the eagle which shaved him from death. The fact that no mention is made of his father in the poem, though his mother is brought in more than once, and the assumption throughout the epic that he is more than human. Given the key to his mythical character is not hard to perceive in his adventures, the daily or annual course of the sun. Rising to its full strength at noon day or mid-summer and sinking at length to the Western horizon, to return and do time to the abode of men. Like all solar days, like the sun itself, his birth and origin are wrapped in mystery. He is indeed one of the fatal children, like Sargon, Percius, or Arthur. When he first appears in the narrative, he is already a full-grown hero, the ruler and it would seem a presser of Eric. His mother, Rimaat Bellett, is a priestess in the temple of Ishtar, and through her he descended from a nappishdom, a native of Shuripak, and the hero of the Babylonian flood legend. Early in the narrative, he is brought into contact with the wild man, Ebonny, originally designed for his destruction by the gods, but with whom he eventually concludes a firm friendship. The parapersy to do battle with the monster Kumbaba, whom they overcome, as they do also the sacred bull, send against them by Anu. Up to the end of the fifth tablet, their conquering and triumphant career is without interruption. Gilgamesh increases in strength as does the sun approaching the zenith. At the seventh tablet, however, his good fortune begins to wane. A bani dies slained outless by the wrath of Ishtar, whose love Gilgamesh has rejected with scorn, and the hero mourning the death of his friend, and smitten with fear that he himself would perish in like manner, decides to go and search of his ancestor, a nappishdom, who, as sole survivor of the deluge, has received from the gods' deification and immortality, and learn of him the secret of eternal life. His further adventures have not the triumphal character of his earlier exploits. Likewise, he journeys to the mountain of the sunset, encounters the scorpion men, and crosses the waters of death. Up nappishdom teaches him the lesson that all men must die. He himself being an exception in an exceptional circumstances, and though he afterwards gives Gilgamesh an opportunity of eating the plan of life, the opportunity is lost. However, up nappishdom cures Gilgamesh of a disease which he has contracted, apparently while crossing the waters of death, and he has finally restored to Eric. In these happenings, we see the gradual sinking of the sun into the underworld, by way of the mountain of the sunset. It is possible for the sun to attain immortality, to remain forever in the land of the living. He must traverse the waters of death, and so journey in the underworld. Yet the return of Gilgamesh to Eric signifies the fresh drawing of the day. It is the eternal struggle of day and night, summer and winter, darkness may conquer light, but light will emerge again victorious. The conquest is unending. Some authorities have seen in the division of the epic into 12 tablets, a connection with the months of the year or the signs of the zodiac. Such a connection probably exists, but when we consider that the artificial division of the epic into tablets, scarcely tallies with the natural divisions of the poem. It seems likely that the astrological significance of the former was given to the epic by the scribes of Nineveh, who were evidently at some pains to compress the matter into 12 tablets. Of the astrological significance of the narrative itself, one of its most important aspects, we shall perhaps be better able to judge when we have considered it in detail. Abony The most important of the various mythological strata underlying the Gilgamesh myth is probably that concerning Abony. This has been said, as a type of primitive man, living among the beasts of the field as one of themselves. But he is also, according to certain authorities, a form of the sun god, even as Gilgamesh himself. Like the hero of Eric, he rises to the zenith of his powers in a triumphal progress then descends into the underworld. He is not lost sight of, however, but lives in the memory of his friend Gilgamesh. And in the eleventh tablet, he is temporarily brought forth from the underworld that is his ghost or utuku, which is a dim and shadowy fashion may typify the daily restorations of the sun. Another important strata of myth is that which concerns up Nappishdom, the Babylonian Noah, but whereas the myths of Abony and Gilgamesh, though still distinguishable, have become thoroughly fused. The delusory of Up Nappishdom is the hero has been inserted bodily into the eleventh tablet of the epic, being related to Gilgamesh by Up Nappishdom himself. When he first appears in the narrative, he has the attributes and powers of a god, having received these for his fidelity to the gods during the flood. From those waters, he alone of all mankind escaped. The objective of his narrative in the Gilgamesh epic seems to be to point out to the hero that only the most exceptional circumstances, unique circumstances, indeed can save man from his doom. Other distinct portions of the epic are the battle with the monster Kumbaba. The episodes of Ishtar's love for Gilgamesh, the fight with the sacred bowl of Anu, and the search for the plant of life. These, whatever their origin had become naturally incorporated with the story of Gilgamesh. But besides the various historical and mythical elements here in presented, there is also a certain amount of Babylonian religious doctrine, evident to some extent in the eleventh tablet, which points the moral that all men must die, but doobly in the twelfth tablet, or in the shade of Abenia, appears to Gilgamesh, relates to the misfortune of the unbearing dead, where of those uncared for after death, and inculcates care for the deceased, as the only means whereby they may evade the grievous woes, which threaten them in the underworld. Let us examine and detail the Gilgamesh epic, as we have seen in the broken fragments which remain to us. The first and second tablet are much mutilated, a number of fragments are extent which belong to one another of these two, but it is not easy to say where the first ends and the second begins. One fragment would seem to contain the very beginning of the first tablet, or sort of general preface to the epic. A compromising list of the advantages to be derived from reading it. After this comes a fragment whose title to inclusion in the epic is doubtful. It describes a siege of the city of Eric, but makes no mention of Gilgamesh. The wulfill condition of Eric under the siege is thus picture-resquely detailed. She assesses, tread down, their young, cow, turn upon their calves, men cry aloud like beasts, and maidens mourn like doves. The gods of strong-walled Eric are changed to flies, and buzz about the streets. The spirits of strong-walled Eric are changed to serpents, and glide into holes. For three years the enemy besieged Eric, and the doors were barred, and the bolts were shot, and it starred did not raise her head against the foe. If this fragment be indeed a portion of the Gilgamesh epic, we have no means of asserting whether Gilgamesh was the besieger, or the riser of the siege, or whether he was concerned in the affair after all. Gilgamesh as tyrant. Now we have come to the real commencement of the poem, inscribed on a fragment which some authorities assigned to the beginning of the second tablet, but which more probably forms a part of the first. In this portion we find Gilgamesh filling the double roll of a ruler and a presser of Eric. The latter evidently not inconsistent with the character of a hero. There is no mention here of a siege, nor is there any record of the coming of Gilgamesh. Though as been indicated, he probably came as a conqueror. His intolerable tyranny towards the people of Eric lends color to this view. He presses the young man into his service in the building of a great wall, and carries off the fairest maidens to his court. He, Hathna left the son to his father, nor the maid to the hero, nor the wife to her husband. Finally, his harshness constrained the people to appeal to the gods, and they prey to the goddess Arurro to create a mighty hero who would champion their cause, and though fear of whom Gilgamesh should be forced to temper his severity, the gods themselves added their prayers to those of oppressed people, and Arurro at length agreed to create a champion against Gilgamesh. Upon hearing these words, so runs the narrative, Arurro conceived a man in the image of a new in her mind. Arurro washed her hands, she broke off a piece of clay, she cast it on the ground. Thus she created Abony, the hero. When the creation of this champion was finished, his appearance was that of a wild man of the mountains. The whole of his body was covered with hair. He was clothed with long hair like a woman. His hair was luxurved like that of the corn god. He knew not the land and the inhabitants they are of. He was clothed with garments of the god of the field. With the gazelles he ate herbs, with the beast he slaked his thirst, with the creatures of the water, his heart rejoiced. His pictorial representations on cylinder seals and elsewhere abanies depicted as a sort of sater, with the head, arms and body of a man, and the horns, ears and legs of a beast. As we have seen, he is a type of beast man, a sort of caliban, ranging with the beasts of the field, utterly ignorant of the things of civilization. The beguiling of Abony, the poem goes on to introduce a new character, to say to the hunter, apparently designed by the gods to bring about the meeting of Gilgamesh and Abony. How he first encounters Abony is not quite clear from the mutilated text. One reading has it that the king of eric, learning the plan of the gods for his overthrow, meant to sido into the mountains in search of Abony, with instructions to entrap him by whatever means and bring him to eric. Another reading describes the encounter as purely accidental. However, this may be to sido returned to eric and related to Gilgamesh the story of his encounter, telling him of the strength and sweetness of the wild man, and his exceeding shyness at the sight of a human being. By this, it is evident that Gilgamesh knows no conjectures. The purpose of which Abony is designed and intends to frustrate the divine plans by anticipating the meaning between himself and the wild man. Accordingly, he bids to sido return to the mountains, taking with him a cut, one of the sacred women of the temple of Ishtar. His plan is that a cut with her while's shall persuade Abony to return with her to eric. Thus the hunter and the girl set out. They took the straight road, and on the third day reached the usual drinking place of Abony. In tysado and the woman placed themselves in hiding, for one day, for two days, they lurk by the drinking place, with the beast Abony slaked his thirst. With the creatures of the water, his heart rejoiced. Then Abony approached, the scene which follows is described at some length. A cut had no difficulty in enthralling Abony with the snares of her beauty. For six days and seven nights, he remembered nothing because of his love for her. On that length, he befought him of his gazelles, his flocks and herds. He found that he would no longer follow him as before, so he sat at the feet of a cut while she told him of Eric in its king. Valar handsome, O'Abeny, Valar like a god. Why does Val traverse the plane with the beast? Come, I will take thee this strong-walled Eric. To the bright place, the dwelling of Anu and Ishtar. To the palace of Gilgamesh, the perfect in strength, who, like a mountain bull, wielded power over man. Abony found the prospect delightful. He longed for the friendship of Gilgamesh and declared himself willing to follow the woman to the city of Eric. And so, a cut, Abony, and to Sadot set out on their journey. Gilgamesh meets Abony. The feast of Ishtar was in progress when they reached Eric. Abony had conceived the idea that he must do battle with Gilgamesh before he could claim that hero as a friend. But being warned, whether in a dream or by a cut is not clear. That Gilgamesh was stronger than he and with all of favorit of the gods. He wisely reframed from combat. Meanwhile Gilgamesh also dreamed a dream which interpreted by his mother, Ramanth Billid, for told coming of Abony. That part of the poem which deals with the meaning of Gilgamesh and Abony is unfortunately no longer extent, but for the fragments which take up the broken narrative, we gather that they met and became friends. The portions of the next epic in order appeared to belong to the second tablet. In these we find Abony, lamenting the loss of his former freedom and shawering maladdictions on the temple maiden was Lord and Thither. However, Shamaash, the Sun got intervened, perhaps in another dream or vision. These play a prominent part in the narrative and showing him the benefit he has derived from his sojourn and the haunts of civilization, endevers with various promises and inducements to make him stay in Eric. Now Gilgamesh, thy friend and brother shall give thee a great couch to sleep on. She'll give the couch carefully prepared. She'll give thee a seat at his left hand and the king of the earth shall kiss thy feet. With this, apparently Abony is satisfied. He ceases to bewale his position at Eric and accepts his destiny with calmness. In the remaining fragments of the tablet, we find him concerned about another dream or vision. And before this portion of the epic closes, the heroes have planned an expedition against the monster Kumbaba, guardian of the abode of the goddess Arnina, a form of Ishtar, in the forest of the Seaters. In the very mutilated third tablet, the two heroes go to consult the priestess, Rematt Bellit, the mother of Gilgamesh. And through her they ask protection from Shamaash in the forthcoming expedition. Gilgamesh advises her son and his friend how to proceed. And after they have gone, we see her alone in the temple. Her hands raised to the sun God, invoking his blessing on Gilgamesh. Why has Thou troubled the heart of my son Gilgamesh? Thou has laid hand upon him, and he go with the way, on a far journey to the dwelling of Kumbaba. He entereth a combat, whose issue he knoweth not. He followeth the road unknown to him, till he arrive, until he return. Gilgamesh reached the forest of Seaters, till he had slain the terrible Kumbaba and rid the land of the evil that Thou had tost till the day of his return. Let Aya thy betroth thy splendor recall him today. With this dignified and beautiful appeal, the tablet comes to an end. The monster Kumbaba. The fourth tablet is concerned with a description of the monster, with whom the heroes are about to do battle. Kumbaba whom Bell had appointed to guard the Seater, the one particular which appears to be of greater height and sanctity than the others, is a creature of most terrifying aspect. The very presence of whom in the forest makes Thou's who entereth grow weak and impotent. As the heroes draw near, himbani complains that his hands are feeble, and his arms without strength. But Gilgamesh speaks words of encouragement to him. It may be noted, in passing, that the word Kumbaba is of Elamite origin, a fact which has led certain authorities to identify the monster, with an Elamite dynasty which anciently dominated Eric, and which came to grief about 2250 BC. It is difficult if not impossible to establish the connection between the mythical encounter and a definite historical event. But it may at least be presumed that the bestowal of an Elamite designation on the monster argues a certain amenity between Elam and Babylon. The next fragments bring us into the fifth tablet. The heroes have reached a verdant mountain, pause to survey the forest of Seaters. When they enter the forest, the death of Kumbaba was foretold to one or other, or both of them, in a dream, and they hasten forward to the combat. Unfortunately, the text of the actual encounter has not been preserved, but we learn from the context that the heroes were successful in slaying Kumbaba. Ish Tars love for Gilgamesh. The sixth tablet which relates the story of Ish Tars love for Gilgamesh, and the slaying of the sacred bull. Victory again waits the arms of the heroes. But here nevertheless, we have the key to the misfortunes which later befall them. On his return to Eric after the destruction of Kumbaba, Gilgamesh was loudly acclaimed. Dolfing the soiled and bloodstained garments, he had worn during the battle. He robbed himself as befitted, a monarch in a conqueror. Ish Tars beheld the kings in his regal splendor. The flowers of victory still fresh on his brow, and her heart went out to him in love. In moving an seductive terms, she besought him to her bride's group, promising that if he would enter her house in the gloom of the cedar, all manner of good gifts shall be his. His flocks and herds would increase. His horses and oxen will be without rival. The river you fraties would kiss his feet, and the kings and princes would bring tribute to him. But Gilgamesh knowing something of the past history of this capricious goddess, rejected her advances with scorn, and began to revile her. He taunted her too, with her treatment of former lovers of Tumuz, the bride's groom of her youth, to whom she clung weepingly year after year, of a Lulu the eagle, of a lion perfect in might and a horse glorious in battle, of the shepherd of Tabulu and of Isolano, the gardener of her father. All these she had mocked and ill-treated in cruel fashion, and Gilgamesh perceived that like treatment would be met at out to him soon, should he accept the prophet love of the goddess. The deity was greatly enraged at the repulse and mounted up to heaven. Moreover, Ishtar went before a new, her father, before a new she went and said, oh my father, Gilgamesh has kept watch on me. Gilgamesh has counted my garlands, my garlands and my girdles. Underlying the story of Ishtar's love for Gilgamesh, there is evidently a nature myth of some sort. Perhaps a spring-tied myth. Gilgamesh, the sun god or a hero would have taken over his attributes, is wood by Ishtar. The goddess of fertility, the great goddess mother who presides over spring vegetation. In the recital of her former love of affairs, we find mention of the Tumuz myth, in which Ishtar slew her consort to moves, and other mythological fragments. It is possible also that there is an astrological significance in this part of the narrative."
