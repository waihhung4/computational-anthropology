"says christopher are the origins of the sumerians part one the origins of the sumerians can be best explained in two forms let's start on who the sumerians were and why do we care the sumerians a culture and society shrouded in mystery and speculation however the question that must be asked why do we care and why do we care about the mystery of their origins the world's first form of writing is origins and the reason why it came about is the main thing we have to ask today writing an achievement that we take for granted in a modern day society but why and how did it start modern day iraq is home to some of the most ancient civilizations with sumer and the albide tribe being the oldest this pragmatic and gifted culture must be explored further in order to understand why this happened in this presentation we'll be also be exploring the sumerian educational system as this gives a glimpse into the mindset of this ancient race in a modern middle school we are taught the basics of the sumerians however from that time we are given no other information in order to pursue this avenue however even this basic information lacks the reason and their ideas of why the sumerians came about and how they developed writing in the first instance we shall endeavor to explain how writing was developed and the reasons behind it and then once we have established that we will have some softer understanding and will then explain the possible origins of the summers from the viewpoint of an amateur sumerologist the sumerians who what and where in the first instance what we call the sumerians and the lands of sumer is not the original name of the people and of the region of southern iraq spanning from the most northern city that have owed him to the most not southern point of a redo however we simply know the former city of or pronounced as uh however this is the semitic name of the city which literally means dog with the original sumerian name of that city being odim please see the tablets ironically named of unamu aye lugao kish the actual word suma was an assyrian name given to the peoples of southern iraq where the true name of this land referred by the inhabitants of sumer as kieringer the land of the lords in addition the sumers referred to themselves as the blackheads possible for the reason that they were darkhead much like iraqis are today however the reason for this is still yet to be proven but for the sake of clarity we shall henceforth refer to the inhabitants of this region as sumerian the ubide period at around 5600 to 4500 bce the original hub inhabitants of the region of the southern regions of iraq where the ubaid tribe as far as where we are aware of which are named after the local mound tel abide where the culture was first discovered this society had basic pottery and developed the potter's wheel even though this is often incorrectly attributed to the sumerians this tribe lived in crude villages comparison to sumerian standards and were often subject to the flooding in the of the marshes and of the tigers rivers during the winter with a drought during the summer arable farmland was scarce at this time and population growth was very limited in addition to the development of pottery for this reason the first sumerian cities in 4500 bce everything changed with the entrance of the sumerian tribe their original origins have been postulated of which we will explore later but in truth their true beginnings are currently unknown when we refer to the year 4000 bce we know that this is the time the ubaid tribe was eventually supplanted and pushed to a more northerly region with the descendants of the ubaid civilization known as the marsh ours today at this time we see the formation of the first cities with eredo being the first however in truth the beginnings of the first city that being of the aforementioned irido being of abiding in origin as even sumers themselves were of the opinion that the city's origins began around 5600 bce with necessity being the mother of invention an explosion of ideas occurred at this time and the first cities began by one simple idea and that was to protect arable farmland from rival villages and townships to protect the aforementioned farmland crude walls were built around these protocities the time of irrigation farming moving on to the year 3800 bce irrigation farming was discovered by the use of canals dubbed from the indigna and the branagno rivers these are the original sumerian names of their tigers and referred his rivers i repeat that the indigna and the burrano and was looked after by the inhabitants these were such a central part of their culture that the king lugal the literal translation means big or great man or even the nc lord priest of the city often worked as part of the community in order to clear the black silt and moss from the canals now the silts we talked about we're talking about um floral spa and quartz an explanation this with this will be further explored in a further presentation at this time not only barley and dates were cultivated but most shocking of all poppies and their their seeds were first originally cultivated in ancient suma most think they originally came from china however this would be inaccurate as they were first grown in the ancient suma a much later sent on the seabourn trade route to china the forerunner to opium was also used in the land of sumer and was referred to as hull gill in other words joy plant or flower of joy it was used for their many of their religious ceremonies with the most notable being they beat akitsu festival at the same time as a formation of irrigation farming alcohol was first fermented and the use of barley bread known as bappia was first used this crude form of alcohol was made by crumbling pieces of papia into water to form the first form of beer for this was the common staple diet for the common man uh in ancient suma and it was so much so important part of their lives they had a gossip of brewing called nincasi literally translated as the lady who fills the mouth however later the summers would develop a much more potent version of alcohol by the use of bappia mixed with the juice of dates clay tokens are the commenting with all these new developments one needed a system of accounting of who owned what of which product and how many clay tokens were used though there is some evidence that the first use of these were much earlier with the impression of the product essentially an image for each item was stamped on a clear coin and impressed for example an impression of a sheep was used on a clay token to signify that this person owned one sheep and this token was kept in a clay wallet called a bula this was a great way of keeping track of who owned what however it was not very good at how many the reason for this is if one had 500 sheep 50 pots of beer and 30 cows then it starts to reason that one could not walk around with all these tokens especially if you lose one of them and with the addition of all that sheer weight of all that clay later a system of showing who owned what and how many was used essentially a way of impressing the same image putting shorthand so to speak by the use of a wedge however instead of making the sign of a sheep three times to represent three items the scribes used to sign for a sheep which eventually became just a wedge to denote quantity a wedge came to represent one and a circle to denote 10 so to write five sheep scribe impresses a wedge five times and then makes the sign for a sheep however we are only at the basic beginnings of the sumerian form of writing and that that was around about 3500 bce things started to change for the better so understand the sumerian language and its writing system will must understand the mind of the sumerian and how they saw the world the sumerian mindset and their views on life to understand the early cuneiform one had as i previously explained to think like sumerian for example the sumer sumerian sign for the concept kua was originally an image for a mountain however it also meant whole land with the addition that it was the same sign for the never world the afterlife or as a more modern individual see it as the underworld it was also the sign and name for the east wind at first glance one would not be able to famine why the same sign could mean have so many differing concepts however if one understands a sumerian mind then a connection becomes apparent between modern days iraq [Music] suma and iran elam are the zagros mountains the elamites from iran used to attack the plains of suma through these mountains so much so that the mountains became associated naturally with death and danger and the afterlife as well as the concept of land and mounting to emphasize this to emphasize this viewpoint the sumerians had a goddess called ninkarasag meaning lady mounted head later the name was changed slightly to ninh herzeg and the other few examples of this trailer thought would be the sign from monas or woman was literally a loose drawing of the female genitalia area that is a triangle with its apex pointing down and a line drawn to the center from the triangle from the apex another would be the concept of god god's heaven the gods of heaven the heavens and this concept is easy to understand and its connections the sign for this is the asterisk or the eight red star in sumerian this concept is called dinger later in sumer two dialects would involve in regards to the female and male dialects this is around the time of 2500 bce when the influence of the canyons in in the north became more apparent for example if a sumerian male scholar wrote about a goddess then he would change from the male into the female dialect even though the writer was male further information that is not tutored in an american junior high school is that sumerian writing was heavily enforced in sumerian schools each student had to labor in their work from sunrise to sunset and mistakes were not tolerated in the least whilst good work was actively praised poor work was punished severely sumerian scribe had to prepare the clear tablet to the correct consistency beforehand and to exactly copy the text that was prepared for them by the teacher called the school father failure to do so merited a beating by the class monitor then by the teacher and then finally by the principle of the whole sumerian school a sumerian school life was a hard one however this was justified by the fact that these scribes were entrusted with high offices later in life now that we've discussed who the sumerians were and why should we care about them that is we care because of their achievements that still stand and are largely relevant even today however let us first explore the possible origins of the sumerian peoples you "
