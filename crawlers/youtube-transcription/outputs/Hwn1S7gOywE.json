"what's the oldest dog breed that is actually a very complicated question and let me answer that with some anthropology so the earliest genetic solid evidence for domestication is about 20 000 years ago in siberia i think it was going on way before that but we know dogs exist 20 thousand years ago for most of that time we are hunting and gathering with dogs for another 10 000 years but uh around the end of the ice age when people start farming in mass agriculture ensues uh the division of labor completely changes for humans now you're not just hunting and gathering you are farming so you're plowing fields you're making farming tools you have sheep you have goats you have all these different things that require different jobs and people still have to make clothes people still have to make you know pottery and baskets and things like that and palisades and houses you can see in this illustration so it's not too far to stretch to say that people probably had kennel masters or dog breeders at this point this is where dog breeds start you need dogs for hunting herding protection probably for racing for gambling in some places definitely for their furs in a lot of places and in most places an emergency and cultural food source "
