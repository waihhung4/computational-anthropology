"[Music] anthropology in general is the scientific study of humans human behavior and societies in the past and present social anthropology is the branch that studies patterns of behavior cultural anthropology focuses on cultural meaning and physical anthropology examines the biological development of humans and the segment that has experienced the most dramatic changes of the past decade with advances in genomics and the sequencing of not only modern genomes but unlocking the secrets of ancient DNA as well we're in the not-so-distant past anthropologist historians and religious scholars would have heated debates over the ethnic origins of humanity's earliest civilizations we can now thanks to genetic analysis come to a definitive consensus over the identities of our ancient forefathers with the same degree of certainty used in court providing paternity tests or forensic evidence used in convicting someone of a crime that said scientists have been publishing their findings concerning some of the most exciting eras of history from the identity of ancient Egyptian mummies to unlocking the details concerning biblical stories known by billions of people worldwide [Music] the tombs of ancient Egypt have yielded golden callers in ivory bracelets but another treasure human DNA has proved elusive now scientists have captured sweeping genomic information from Egyptian mummies it reveals that mummies were closely related to ancient Middle Easterners hinting that northern Africans might have different genetic roots from the peoples south of the Sahara Desert the study published on 30 may in Nature communications includes data from 90 mummies buried between 13 80 BC during Egypt's new kingdom and ad 425 in the Roman era the findings show that the mummies closest kin were ancient farmers from a region that includes present-day Israel and Jordan modern Egyptians by contrast have inherited more of their DNA from central Africans archaeological discoveries and historical documents suggest close ties between Egypt and the Middle East but it is very nice that this study has now provided empirical evidence for this at the genetic level says evolutionary through Paula gist Omar cockman of the State University of New York at Buffalo the latest analysis succeeded by bypassing soft tissue often abundant in Egyptian mummies to seek DNA from bone and teeth researchers carefully screened the DNA to rule out contamination from anyone who had handled the mummies since the excavation a century ago in the ancient town of abu ser el malik more than half of the mummies we studied had pretty decent DNA preservation says co-author Johannes Krauss a paleo geneticist at the Max Planck Institute for the science of human history in Jena Germany the team succeeds where previous studies on Egyptian mummies have failed or fallen short says Hans Schroeder a paleo geneticist at the University of Copenhagen now researchers can hope to answer questions such as whether immigration drove ancient Egyptian population growth at sonya sacral skee a bio archaeologist at the University of Southampton UK the scientists obtained information about variations in mitochondrial DNA which is passed from mother to child from 90 mummies because of contamination the team was able to acquire detailed nuclear DNA which is inherited from both parents from only three mummies both types of genomic materials showed that ancient Egyptians shared little DNA with modern sub-saharan Africans instead the closest relatives were people living during the neolithic and bronze ages and the area known as the Levant strikingly the mummies were more closely related to ancient Europeans and Anatolians than to modern Egyptians the researchers say that there was probably a pulse of sub-saharan African DNA into Egypt roughly 700 years ago the mixing of ancient Egyptians and Africans from further south means that modern Egyptians can trace 8% more of their ancestry to sub-saharan Africans than can the mummies from abu ser el Malik the new data can explain why the ancient Egyptians were so tightly aligned with people from the Middle East was it the results of migration or were the Stone Age hunter gatherers of northern Africa genetically similar to those of the Levant it's too early to tell crowd said but there's a better chance now of getting answers this is the first glimpse of the genetic history of Egypt he says but it's really just the start [Music] so the DNA confirms that the ancient Egyptians shared genetic affinities with Europeans Anatolians and fair-skinned people of the ancient Middle East that would make sense as not only are the ancient Egyptian mummies blonde or red-haired the ancient Egyptian statues of their pharaohs and nobility have blue eyes the same deep blue eyes we find in ancient Sumerian statues of their gods and nobility more validation comes again by way of genetics by recent published studies carried out by an international team of researchers led by scientists from the Sackler Faculty of Medicine in Tel Aviv University the Institute for Galilean archaeology chimeric College the Israeli Antiquities Authority and Harvard University blue-eyed fair-skinned settlers inhabited the Levant some 6500 years ago according to an international interdisciplinary team of scientists an article released Monday in the peer-reviewed journal Nature communications solves the mystery of how Chalcolithic culture got to the Galilee via population migration when they mapped the genomes of bones from 22 of the 600 individual skeletons discovered in a massive necropolis near pecking in north of the country the scientists found a genetic mix quite unlike that of previous and successive settlers to the region in the article ancient DNA from chaco lytic Israel reveals the role of population mixture and cultural transformation the scientists concluded that the homogeneous community found in the cave could source 57% of its ancestry from groups related to those of the local Levant neolithic 26% from groups related to those of the anatolian neolithic and 17% from groups related to those of the Iran Chalcolithic the genetic analysis provided an answer to the central question we set out to address said Harvard's Reich it showed that the pecking people had substantial ancestry from northerners similar to those living in Iran and Turkey that was not present in earlier Levantine farmers the child coletek era also dubbed the Copper Age follows the Stone Age and precedes the Bronze Age there are already several DNA analysis for Bronze Age settlement in the Levant including last summer's publication of research from Bronze Age burials that shows that 93% of the ancestry of modern Lebanese ancestry comes from the Canaanites now the new pecking genome mapping fills in a void of 3,000 years of DNA analysis with the new studies conclusion that some half of the indigenous chocolate ik people's genomes derived from ancient Turkey and Iran it appears that these artifacts may have arrived during migration and were not merely as the byproducts of a trade route as previously suggested the scientists uncovered some recessive genetic traits not usually expected in human remains from the Levant certain characteristics such as blue eye color were not seen in the DNA test results of earlier Levantine human remains said may the blue-eyed fair-skinned community didn't continue but at least now researchers have an idea why these findings suggest that the rise and fall of the Chalcolithic culture are probably due to demographic changes in the region said me [Music] as I've covered in my previous videos the four thousand-year-old mummified remains found in China of six foot six inch tall blonde Aryan looking people near those massive pyramids that the Chinese government still tries to conceal from satellite imagery by planting trees on top of them are also from Iran not Ireland not Germany it's the other way around they are Aryans from Iran that entered into Europe the same way they entered India entered Egypt and even entered Ethiopia as Herodotus tells us the ancient Ethiopians were the fairest of all men it is clear that the demographics that populate the world today in most cases are very different than what it was thousands of years ago and the

see you again soon around 500 BC ancient Greece was comprised of two primary city-states that could be considered superpowers of their day Athens and Sparta the Athenians enjoyed a period of naval supremacy in the Mediterranean Sea and was a place where democracy art and philosophy flourished the Spartans on the other hand were a militaristic society considered by historians to be among the most elite land-based fighting armies at their prime around 480 BC these two rivals joined forces and teamed up to defend Greece from a common enemy the invading Persian Empire while the Spartans fought valiantly as documented in movies such as 300 and the Athenians one decisive naval battles the mighty Persian army still managed to burn down the sacred temples to the gods on the Athenian Acropolis the Persians were eventually forced to abandon their invasion and what followed was the Golden Age of classical Greece which lasted for about 50 years before Greece fell back into internal wars between the Greek city-states after about a century of fighting ancient Greece became depleted and vulnerable this time to a new rising power to the north the Macedonians [Music] under king philip ii macedonia emerged as a formidable military force due in large part to being well-trained but also introducing a new type of weapon to the battlefield an 18 foot long pike called a sarisa twice the length of a normal Greek spear that proved to give a definitive advantage over the standard failings the name given to the most common military formation at the time in 338 BC King Philip's army crushed the joint army of Thebes and Athens uniting Greece except for Sparta under what became known as the Hellenic League King Philip was assassinated by his own bodyguard and was succeeded by his 20 year-old son Alexander who was tutored by none other than Aristotle himself and already experienced in the art of war Alexander consolidated power by crushing his rivals and proceeded to invade Persia by 334 BC with an army of about 40,000 [Applause] victoriously penetrating into Asia Minor finally confronting King Darius king of kings himself whose army outnumbered Alexander's to the one despite the numbers Alexander achieved a stunning victory massacring the Persian army with King Darius fleeing and retreat but Alexander capturing the king's wife mother and three children Alexander went on to conquer the Phoenician coastal cities continuing to Egypt conquering everything in his path and declared Pharaoh by the priests of Memphis he then founded a new city named it Alexandria and eventually went on to establish another dozen cities all bearing his name Alexander marched eastward conquering territory that extended to the ends of the known world at the time but while there's a lot more to the story I would like to now read a letter from Alexander the Great - Darius king of Persia and I quote your ancestors invaded macedonia and the rest of Greece and did us harm although we had not done you any previous injury I've been appointed commander-in-chief of the Greeks and it is with the aim of punishing the Persians that I have crossed into Asia since you are the aggressors you gave support to the people of parenthesis sent a force to Thrace which was under our rule my father died at the hand of conspirators instigated by you as you yourself boasted to everybody in your letters you killed our Sassuolo gasps and gained your throne through unjust means in defiance of Persian custom and doing wrong to the Persians you sent unfriendly letters to the Greeks about me to push them to war against me and send money to the Spartans and some other Greeks which none of the other cities would accept apart from the Spartans your envoys corrupted my friends and sought to destroy the peace which I established among the Greeks I therefore led an expedition against you and you started the choral but now I have defeated in battle first your generals and now you in person and your army and by the grace of the gods I controlled the country all those who fought on your side and did not die in battle that came over to me I hold myself responsible for them they are not on my side under duress but are taking part in expedition of their own free will approach me therefore as the Lord of all Asia if you are afraid of suffering harm at my hands by coming in person send some of your friends to receive proper assurances come to me and ask and receive your mother your wife your children and anything else you wish whatever you can persuade me to give shall be yours in future whenever you communicate with me send to me as king of Asia do not write to me as an equal but state your demands to the master of all your possessions if not I shall deal with you as a wrongdoer if you wish to lay claim to the title of King then stand your ground and fight for it do not take flight as I shall pursue you wherever you may be end quote [Music] [Music] my name is Robert

inspired Hesiod to write the 800 line epic poem called works and days in it Hesiod tells a Greek creation story that traces the lineage of mankind through five successive ages or races the most ancient is the golden age the only age that falls within the rule of Chronos it is said that it was a time when people lived among the gods and freely mingled with them peace and harmony prevailed during this age humans did not have to work to feed themselves for the earth provided food in abundance they lived to a very old age but with the youthful appearance and eventually died peacefully their spirits lived on as Guardians Plato recounts the golden race of men who came first and he clarifies that Hesiod did not mean men were literally made of gold but were good and Noble and held integrity and virtue in high regard he describes these men as demons upon the earth demons in this context comes from an ancient Greek sense meaning knowing or wise or divine principle they are beneficent preventing ills and guardians of mortal men so please don't confuse the meaning with more modern negative connotations [Music] the next stage is called the Silver Age the Silver Age and every age that follows fall within the rule of Chronos is successor and son Zeus men in the Silver Age lived for 100 years under the dominion of their mothers they lived only a short time as grown adults and spent that time in strife with one another during this age men refused to worship the gods and Zeus destroyed them for their impiety after death humans of this age became blessed spirits of the underworld next is the Bronze Age men of the Bronze Age were hard war was their purpose and passion not only arms and tools but they're very homes were forged of bronze the men of this age were undone by their own violent ways and left no-name spirits but dwell in the dank house of Hades it came to an end with the massive flood now you'll notice that each age gets progressively worse to this point lifespans are shorter and life itself is more difficult or challenging so we started with gold then silver then bronze and we'll eventually get to the iron age but not yet in between the Bronze Age and the Iron Age is what is called the heroic age [Music] the heroic age is the one age that does not correspond with any metal it is also the only age that improves upon the age it follows in this period men lived with noble demigods and heroes it was the heroes of this age who fought at Thebes and Troy this race of humans died and went to Elysium Elysium would also be known as the fortunate aisles or islands of the blest located in the western ocean at the end of the earth and now we finally get to the Iron Age Hesiod finds himself in the Iron Age and during this age humans lived to an existence of toil and misery children dishonor their parents brother fights with brother and the social contract between guests and hosts is forgotten during this age might makes right and bad men use lies to be thought of as good at the height of this age humans no longer feel shame or indignation at wrongdoing and the gods will have completely forsaken humanity and I quote there will be no help against evil and quote for those who have followed my work I placed their arrival or sudden appearance of cro-magnon as the time of the heroic age which I've said is the only age that improves upon the age of follows so each age follows a sort of devolution or degradation until the Heroic Age and anthropologically speaking is with cro-magnon that we see a sudden leap in tool technology or animal domestication and everything else we associate with civilization compared to other hominids of the Pleistocene my name is Robert separ I'm an anthropologist I want to thank all my

taught at an early age that Thomas Edison was probably the greatest inventor who ever lived there is no argument that he created some of the most spectacular technology the world has ever seen he certainly did hold more than 1,000 patents however it appears that he may have gone to any lengths to claim credit for inventions of other people's work and creativity Edison gets credit for the fluoroscope this was a device which first made x-rays possible and also added Edison's growing wealth the problem is that the actual inventor of a device to see the bones of a human was a German scientist named William rantin who took an x-ray of his wife's hand several years prior to Edison's fluoroscope Edison was more than happy not to correct the error another concept Edison is given credit for is creating devices for recording speech and other forms of sound a French printer and bookseller named Edward leon scott de martinville created his fond autograph more than fifteen years before Edison's 1877 invention of the phonograph again Thomas Edison made no mention of Martinville when marketing his own device many people regard Edison as the father of motion pictures however there's fairly solid argument that Louise a prince created a working motion picture before Edison but when traveling to America its patented he got on a train and nobody saw him again his son continued with the patent request and eventually testified against Edison but someone shot him so Edison got the lucrative patent there's no doubt however that Edison was a great businessman and knew how to manipulate the press in his favor you probably heard about the famous rivalry between Nikola Tesla and Thomas Edison where Edison electrocuted cats dogs and even an elephant to make Tesla's AC DC technology seem more dangerous than his own direct current technology what most people are not aware of however is that Edison was very interested in the afterlife entranced with it in fact and in his eyes life after death was not the way perhaps many envision it his theory was that there was basically a set amount of life in the universe and it could not be created or destroyed much like the conservation of energy or mass law in thermodynamics this life he surmised came in the form of my reads of infinitesimal entities each a separate consciousness which acted much like atoms do with matter forming the smallest building blocks of life as we know it according to him the individual consciousnesses in each person were made up of unique patterns of these tiny entities which grouped together in swarms within the brain to form our soul he believed that death came when these tiny entities disagreed and that they could go on into existence beyond the physical body in Edison's own words and I quote I believe that life like matter is indestructible there has always been a certain amount of life in this world and there will always be the same amount you cannot create life you cannot destroy life you cannot multiply life I believe our bodies are composed of my reeds and my reeds of entities each in itself a unit of life which band together to build a man in our bodies these entities constantly rebuild our tissues to replace those which are constantly wearing out they watch after functions of the various organs just as the engineers in a powerhouse see that the machine is kept in perfect order once conditions and the body become unsatisfactory in the body either through a fatal sickness fatal accident or old age the entities simply depart from the body and leave little more than an empty structure behind being diligent workers they naturally seek something else to do they either enter into the body of another man or even start to work on some other form of life at any rate there's a fixed amount of these and it is the same entity that I've served over and over again they fight out their differences and then the stronger group takes charge if the minority is willing to be disciplined and to conform there's harmony but minority sometimes say to hell with this place let's get out of it they refuse to do their appointed work in the man's body he sickens and dies and they are all free to seek out new experiences somewhere else when we die these swarms of Units like a swarm of bees so to speak we take themself elsewhere and wants functioning in some other form or environment there are many indications that we human beings act as a community rather than as units that is why I believe that each of us comprises millions upon millions of entities and that our body and our mind represent the vote or voice whichever you wish to call it of our entities the entities live forever death is simply the departure of the entities from our body if the units of life which compose an individual's memory hold together after death is it not within range of possibility to say the least that these memory swarms could retain the powers they formerly possessed and thus retained what we called the individuals personality after dissolution of the body I'm hopeful that by providing the right kind of instrument to be operated by this personality we can receive intelligent messages from it and it's changed habitation or environment end quote Edison surmised that if these particles of consciousness could be arranged back in their prior harmony then that dead person's consciousness would be essentially resurrected it was his guess that some sort of photographic plate could be used to record the precise layout of these entities and serve as a sort of snapshot to the personality that had passed on allowing them to be put back together again Edison apparently spent a lot of effort trying to prove that these theoretical particles existed gathering a team of scientists to test out a machine that could detect them and trying to craft a device that could be used to communicate with personalities that had passed from the world of the living he would in October of 1920 give a rather spectacular announcement to the media saying that he had been working on an apparatus that would be able to contact the dead which would go on to be called the spirit phone it is unknown just how far along Edison was on an actual device to talk to spirits but Nikola Tesla was also developing a similar device at the same time both men were racing to create a something that picked up on the frequencies of discarnate spirits what today is called EVP or electronic voice phenomenon Nikola Tesla thought that the universe was composed of an infinite variety of sound and electromagnetic waves and that if you could zero in on the right ones you could hear the voices of the departed my name is Robert supper I'm an anthropologist you can find my published work on Amazon please don't forget to subscribe hit like share and leave your thoughts in the comment section thank you for listening and I hope to see you again soon whenever I feel like just getting away whether to think about something specific or to just reflect on life itself I often find myself coming back to the beach there's just something about the fresh air and looking out across the endless blue ocean that expands my mind and helps me to open up to new possibilities that just seem more difficult to do when I'm cooped up indoors staring at four walls and on this sunny day in California I started wondering about what happens after we die [Music] where do we go somewhere specific nowhere at all a heaven or hell or maybe reincarnation although I've come across many theories I can't say for sure and I'm not sure that anyone else living knows with absolute certainty either that said mr. alan watts offers an interesting concept for us to ponder let's have a listen just in the same way as you don't focus your attention on how you make your thyroid gland function so in the same way you don't have any attention focused on how you shine the Sun so then let me connect this with the problem of birth and death which puzzles people enormous Lee of course because in order to understand what what the self is you have to remember that it doesn't need to remember anything just like you don't need to know how you work your thyroid gland so then when you die you're not going to have to put up with everlasting non-existence because that's not an experience a lot of people are afraid that when they die they're going to be locked up in a darkroom forever and it and sort of undergo that but one of the most interesting things in the world this is a yoga this is a way of realization try and imagine what it will be like to go to sleep and never wake up think about that children think about it it's one of the great wonders of life what will it be like to go to sleep and never wake up and if you think long enough about that something will happen to you you will find out among other things that it'll pose the next question to you what was it like to wake up after having never gone to sleep that was when you were born you see you you can't have an experience of nothing nature abhors a vacuum so after you are dead the only thing that can happen is the same experience or the same sort of experience as when you were born in other words we all know very well that after people die other people are born and they're all you only you can only experience it one at a time everybody is I you all know you are you and wheresoever beings exist throughout all galaxies it doesn't make any difference you are all of them and when they come into being that's you coming into being you know that very well only you don't have to remember the past in the same way you don't have to think about how you work your thyroid gland or whatever else it is in your organism you don't have to know how to shine the Sun you just do it like you breathe isn't there doesn't it really astonish you that you are this fantastically complex thing and that you're doing all of this and you never had any education in how to do it you never learn the picture this miracle well the point is that from a strictly physical scientific standpoint this organism is a continuous energy with everything else that's going on and if I am my foot I am the son [Music] it's a very deep concept hard to totally get my mind around if true it would mean that every amazing experience every lottery winner every first date or wedding and likewise every case of suffering and illness and even murder all those experiences we would all experience and the next thought is how it gives a literal interpretation of karma since everything you put out is literally an ultimately directly experience by another version of self let's consider the implications a little further let's suppose that you were able every night to dream any dream you wanted to dream and that you could for example have the power within one night to dream 75 years of time or any length of time you wanted to have and you would naturally as you began on this adventure of Dreams you would fulfill all your wishes you would have every kind of pleasure who could conceive and after several nights of 75 years of total pleasure each you would say well that was pretty great but now let's um let's have a surprise let's have a dream which isn't under control where something is going to happen to me that I don't know what its gonna be and you you would dig that and come out of that and say wow that was a close shave wasn't it and then you would get more and more adventurous and you would make further and further out Gamble's as to what you would dream and finally you would dream where you are now you would dream the dream of living the life that you were actually living today that would be within the infinite multiplicity of choices you would have of playing that you weren't God because the whole nature of the Godhead according to this idea is to play that he's not the first thing he says to himself his man get lost because he gives himself away the nature of love is self-abandonment not clinging to oneself throwing yourself out as in for example in basketball you're always getting rid of the ball you say to the other fellow have a ball see and that keeps things moving that's the nature of life so in this idea then everybody is fundamentally the ultimate reality not God in a politically kingly sense but God in the sense of being the self the deep down basic whatever there is and you're all that only you're pretending you're not [Music] my name is Robert separ I'm an anthropologist you can
