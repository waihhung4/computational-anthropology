"Did you know the world's first civilization\u00a0\non earth post-great flood was the Sumerian\u00a0\u00a0 Mesopotamian civilization? Anthropological and\u00a0\narchaeological evidence discovered in the past\u00a0\u00a0 100 years suggests that this civilization\u00a0\nis the origin of all modern humans,\u00a0\u00a0 known as Homo sapiens. Every human has some\u00a0\nform of ancestry connected to Sumerian society,\u00a0\u00a0 as each continent has aboriginal tribes\u00a0\noriginating from East Africa. Recently,\u00a0\u00a0 archaeologists discovered the biblical\u00a0\nGarden of Eden nestled between the Tigris\u00a0\u00a0 and Euphrates rivers in modern-day Iraq,\u00a0\nwithin the Middle Eastern region of Africa. The Sumerians, the first modern\u00a0\nhuman civilization post-flood,\u00a0\u00a0 laid the foundation for human progress. They\u00a0\ninvented cuneiform writing, one of the earliest\u00a0\u00a0 forms of writing. Their technological advancements\u00a0\nincluded the wheel, plow, irrigation systems,\u00a0\u00a0 and sailboats. They constructed towering\u00a0\nziggurats and developed complex legal\u00a0\u00a0 and administrative systems. They also brewed\u00a0\nbeer and excelled in metallurgy and textiles. The Sumerians believed in mysterious\u00a0\ngiant beings called the Anunnaki,\u00a0\u00a0 meaning \"Those who came from heaven,\" whom\u00a0\nthey worshiped as gods. These beings became\u00a0\u00a0 the subjects of the first written\u00a0\nmythological stories on earth. The\u00a0\u00a0 mythologist Joseph Campbell in his book \"the\u00a0\npower of myth\" mentions finding that every\u00a0\u00a0 ancient culture universally shared similar\u00a0\norigin and mythological stories of the same\u00a0\u00a0 gods in every continent and the connections\u00a0\nlead back to the most ancient civilization. Known as the \"black-headed people,\" the Sumerians\u00a0\nwere referred to as the \"sun people\" or \"Adamites\"\u00a0\u00a0 in various ancient texts. Step back in time to\u00a0\nhumanity's ancient ancestors in the fertile plains\u00a0\u00a0 of ancient Mesopotamia and Sumer, where\u00a0\nlush greenery and agricultural abundance\u00a0\u00a0 flourished. Immerse yourself in\u00a0\nthe rich Sumerian arts, sciences,\u00a0\u00a0 and culture of an advanced society\u00a0\nthat predates ancient Egypt and Greece. Picture the symmetrically structured city-states\u00a0\nof Ur... Uruk... and Eridu... each a testament\u00a0\u00a0 to the Sumerians' unique ingenuity. Imagine the\u00a0\nfirst civilization of mankind being established\u00a0\u00a0 after the biblical great flood transformed mud\u00a0\nand clay into architectural marvels, erecting\u00a0\u00a0 ziggurats that reached towards the heavens. In\u00a0\nits heyday, The skyline of the Sumerian cities\u00a0\u00a0 was punctuated by colossal temples nestled in the\u00a0\nheart, where priests communed with the gods, and\u00a0\u00a0 scholars transcribed the first written language,\u00a0\ncuneiform, onto clay tablets. The Sumerians'\u00a0\u00a0 intricate cuneiform writing system, emerged around\u00a0\n3500 BCE. It involved pressing a wedge-shaped\u00a0\u00a0 stylus into clay tablets, creating wedge-like\u00a0\nimpressions. Scribes Initially, cuneiform served\u00a0\u00a0 as a system of accounting for trade transactions.\u00a0\nOver time, it evolved into a versatile script\u00a0\u00a0 encompassing a wide range of subjects. Sumerians\u00a0\nrecorded religious hymns for the gods, laws,\u00a0\u00a0 and history of their civilization including the\u00a0\nEpic of Gilgamesh and administrative documents\u00a0\u00a0 including the Sumerian king list. The script's\u00a0\nadaptability contributed to its longevity,\u00a0\u00a0 as it persisted through various Mesopotamian and\u00a0\nSumerian cultures for centuries all the way to\u00a0\u00a0 current day. Oxford Institute reported as of\u00a0\n2020 that are 700 tablets that have not been\u00a0\u00a0 translated or read, majority of these tablets that\u00a0\nare on public and translated are on display in\u00a0\u00a0 England however most of the 700 tablets are with\u00a0\nthe Vatican, in the underground archives.\n \n \n  Ur was the legendary home of Abraham, the\u00a0\n\u201cfather\u201d of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.\u00a0\u00a0 He and his caravan carried the stories of their\u00a0\nancestors with them as they traveled from southern\u00a0\u00a0 to northern Iraq, through Syria and into Egypt\u00a0\nbefore settling in the land of Canaan, which is\u00a0\u00a0 modern-day Israel. About 200 years ago, European\u00a0\narchaeologists were digging in what is now the\u00a0\u00a0 Middle East, mainly in Egypt located in north\u00a0\nAfrica and southern Mesopotamia which is located\u00a0\u00a0 in the country and territory of modern-day Iraq.\u00a0\nThey were searching for places mentioned in the\u00a0\u00a0 Bible, works by Greek authors like Herodotus and\u00a0\nStrabo, and journals of medieval and Renaissance\u00a0\u00a0 travelers like Benjamin of Tudela and Pietro de\u00a0\nla Valle. Names like Babylon, Nineveh, and Ur were\u00a0\u00a0 known, but their exact locations were unclear. By\u00a0\nthe early 1800s, archaeologists made significant\u00a0\u00a0 discoveries. Englishman Claudius James Rich mapped\u00a0\nthe ruins of Babylon and Nineveh, finding bricks,\u00a0\u00a0 tablets, clay cylinders, and boundary stones with\u00a0\nmysterious markings. These were also found in Iran\u00a0\u00a0 at sites like Persepolis and Bahistun. Scholars\u00a0\nrealized these markings were scripts of unknown\u00a0\u00a0 languages. Deciphering one set, Old Persian,\u00a0\nhelped unlock the others. The script found in\u00a0\u00a0 Babylon and Nineveh was Akkadian, then called\u00a0\nBabylonian, and the third script was Elamite. Akkadian, a Semitic language like Hebrew and\u00a0\nArabic, became well understood. In the mid-19th\u00a0\u00a0 century, scholars suspected cuneiform, the\u00a0\nwritten form of Akkadian, was not developed by the\u00a0\u00a0 Babylonians and Assyrians but by another people\u00a0\nbefore them. Inscriptions mentioned \"Sumer and\u00a0\u00a0 Akkad,\" indicating another place and people: the\u00a0\nSumerians. Early archaeologists had unknowingly\u00a0\u00a0 discovered what is now considered the mother\u00a0\ncivilization of the Babylonians and Assyrians. Around 7000 to 6000 BC, people moved south\u00a0\nalong the Tigris and Euphrates rivers to\u00a0\u00a0 the fertile floodplains of Mesopotamia,\u00a0\nnow Iraq and northern Syria. Mesopotamia,\u00a0\u00a0 meaning \"land between rivers,\" was ideal for\u00a0\nlarge-scale farming due to its rich, fertile\u00a0\u00a0 soil from river flooding. Farming had already\u00a0\nbegun thousands of years earlier in the Near East,\u00a0\u00a0 in the Fertile Crescent, a region of productive\u00a0\nland stretching from the eastern Mediterranean,\u00a0\u00a0 through Turkey and northern Iraq, to the Persian\u00a0\nGulf. One of the early farming communities in\u00a0\u00a0 central Mesopotamia was the Samarra culture, named\u00a0\nafter the site where it was first discovered. This\u00a0\u00a0 culture dates back to between 6500 and 5500\u00a0\nBC. Samarra pottery has a distinctive style,\u00a0\u00a0 often decorated with geometric images\u00a0\nrepresenting natural phenomena. The early\u00a0\u00a0 farmers of this culture dug irrigation\u00a0\ncanals to control rivers and streams. Another widespread culture was the\u00a0\nHalaf culture, active between 6500 and\u00a0\u00a0 5500 BC, with some estimates narrowing\u00a0\nit to 5700 to 5000 BC. Like the Samarra,\u00a0\u00a0 the Halaf culture produced distinctive and\u00a0\nbeautiful pottery that was widely traded\u00a0\u00a0 throughout the Fertile Crescent. In return, the\u00a0\nHalaf people received goods such as obsidian,\u00a0\u00a0 bitumen, and seashells. They also created\u00a0\nsome of the earliest examples of stamp seals. After 6000 BC in southern Mesopotamia, changes\u00a0\nbegan that set the stage for civilization. This\u00a0\u00a0 started with the Ubaid culture, named after the\u00a0\nsite of Tell al-Ubaid, near the future Sumerian\u00a0\u00a0 city of Ur, which began as an Ubaid settlement.\u00a0\nThe Ubaid culture dates from 5500 to 4000 BC. The\u00a0\u00a0 exact origins of the Ubaid people are unknown,\u00a0\nbut they likely migrated from other parts of the\u00a0\u00a0 Fertile Crescent. Most Ubaid sites were small\u00a0\nvillages, but by the late 5th to early 4th\u00a0\u00a0 millennium BC, some settlements grew into towns\u00a0\nwith nearly 5000 residents. They grew wheat,\u00a0\u00a0 barley, and lentils, and raised livestock\u00a0\nincluding cattle, goats, and sheep. Typical Ubaid\u00a0\u00a0 villages had several one-story houses and larger\u00a0\nstorage facilities. Most Ubaid sites had a central\u00a0\u00a0 earthen mound with a small building, believed to\u00a0\nbe an early temple and precursor to the ziggurat. The Ubaid also traded their unique hand-painted\u00a0\npottery and crafts such as figurines. Ubaid\u00a0\u00a0 pottery was highly prized and found at multiple\u00a0\nsites throughout the Middle East, including\u00a0\u00a0 Turkey, Iran, Syria, and the southeastern\u00a0\nArabian Peninsula. Much of what we know about\u00a0\u00a0 Ubaid culture comes from the ruins of Eridu, a\u00a0\ncity famous in Sumerian mythology as the home of\u00a0\u00a0 the celestial water god Enki. Eridu was believed\u00a0\nto be very ancient. According to the Sumerian\u00a0\u00a0 King List, it was the first city where kingship\u00a0\nwas established. Archaeologists have determined\u00a0\u00a0 that Eridu may have been inhabited as far back as\u00a0\n8000 BC, over 10,000 years ago. During the Ubaid\u00a0\u00a0 period, Eridu was an ideal place to settle.\u00a0\nIt had plenty of fertile land for farming\u00a0\u00a0 and abundant fish from nearby marshes close to\u00a0\nthe Gulf. Back then, the Persian Gulf's shores\u00a0\u00a0 were much further inland, making the area seem\u00a0\nlike a paradise in the otherwise harsh desert. At first, Eridu was a small village with a modest\u00a0\nshrine to the water god Enki. Excavations show\u00a0\u00a0 that Enki's sanctuary started as a small\u00a0\nbrick room less than eight square meters,\u00a0\u00a0 with an altar and a stand for ritual offerings.\u00a0\nAshes and fish bones found there suggest these\u00a0\u00a0 offerings were part of religious rituals.\u00a0\nArchaeologists believe the people of\u00a0\u00a0 Eridu held communal feasts with prayers,\u00a0\nsinging, and music to honor Enki. Out of all\u00a0\u00a0 the male gods, Enki was the most loved\u00a0\nby the Sumerians. It is said that Enki,\u00a0\u00a0 the water god, engineered the black-headed\u00a0\npeople of modern-day India and Africa,\u00a0\u00a0 who are considered the closest ancestors\u00a0\nto the Sumerians, alongside the Ethiopians. As the village of Eridu grew, so did the\u00a0\ntemple. By 4500 BC, the temple stood on\u00a0\u00a0 a platform about a meter high and continued\u00a0\nto expand over the centuries into a ziggurat,\u00a0\u00a0 a step-like pyramid. Prosperous towns like Eridu\u00a0\nattracted travelers and merchants who visited\u00a0\u00a0 its temples, such as those dedicated to Enki, to\u00a0\nmake offerings. They brought items from their own\u00a0\u00a0 villages to donate or trade for local goods like\u00a0\nbarley, sheep, or Eridu's distinctive pottery. An example of international trade in Eridu was\u00a0\ncopper. Copper, a valuable metal not found in\u00a0\u00a0 southern Mesopotamia, had to be imported\u00a0\nfrom places like modern Oman or Turkey.\u00a0\u00a0 Remarkably, Ubaid period artisans\u00a0\nin Eridu were already forging basic\u00a0\u00a0 copper items. Another imported item\u00a0\nwas obsidian, likely from Turkey. Most early settlements were small, with a\u00a0\nfew hundred people. Exceptions like Eridu and\u00a0\u00a0 Tell Zeidan in Syria had populations of around\u00a0\n3,000. However, less than a millennium later,\u00a0\u00a0 ancient Mesopotamia saw cities with\u00a0\npopulations in the tens of thousands.\u00a0\u00a0 One such city was Uruk, located less\u00a0\nthan 200 kilometers northwest of Eridu. Zechariah Sitchin, a prominent Sumerian researcher\u00a0\nand author once ridiculed for his views,\u00a0\u00a0 presents an intriguing theory in his first book\u00a0\nof the Earth Chronicles series, *Twelfth Planet*.\u00a0\u00a0 Sitchin proposes that the Anunnaki, whom the\u00a0\nSumerians referred to as \"gods,\" were not mythical\u00a0\u00a0 beings but advanced extraterrestrial humanoids.\u00a0\nAccording to his translations of the Sumerian text\u00a0\u00a0 \"The Seven Tablets of Creation,\" which he claims\u00a0\nis the template for the modern Bible, the Anunnaki\u00a0\u00a0 came from a red planet in dire need of saving.\u00a0\nThis planet, which Sitchin refers to as the 12th\u00a0\u00a0 celestial body of our galaxy, allegedly passes\u00a0\nnear Earth every 3,000 years, or 1 shar. \n \n \n  Sitchin suggests that the Anunnaki were not just\u00a0\ncreators of humanity but genetic engineers who\u00a0\u00a0 modified primates in Africa 250,000 years ago,\u00a0\nsetting the course for modern human evolution.\u00a0\u00a0 Though his beliefs in the ancient alien theory\u00a0\nwere widely ridiculed during his lifetime,\u00a0\u00a0 recent discoveries have led some in the scientific\u00a0\nand historical communities to re-examine his work. In Zechariah Sitchin's *Earth\u00a0\nChronicles*, he mentions that\u00a0\u00a0 the Anunnaki shared their technology with\u00a0\nthe Sumerians. Standing tall and powerful,\u00a0\u00a0 their godlike intelligence and similar\u00a0\nappearance awed the ancient Sumerians.\u00a0\u00a0 Before the Anunnaki spread across Earth\u00a0\nto create new civilizations, they first\u00a0\u00a0 taught the Sumerians advanced skills, fueling\u00a0\ntechnological growth and cultural exchange. Skilled artisans crafted pottery and sculptures,\u00a0\nreflecting their advanced society and reverence\u00a0\u00a0 for their extraterrestrial mentors. A thriving\u00a0\neconomy, a society with such extensive material\u00a0\u00a0 enterprises, could not have developed without an\u00a0\nefficient system of transportation. The Sumerians\u00a0\u00a0 used their two great rivers and the artificial\u00a0\nnetwork of canals for waterborne transportation\u00a0\u00a0 of people, goods, and cattle. Some of the\u00a0\nearliest depictions show what were undoubtedly\u00a0\u00a0 the world's first boats. In many early texts, it\u00a0\nis stated that the Sumerians engaged in deep water\u00a0\u00a0 seafaring, using a variety of ships to reach\u00a0\nfaraway lands in search of metals, rare woods,\u00a0\u00a0 stones, and other materials unobtainable in Sumer\u00a0\nproper. An Akkadian dictionary of the Sumerian\u00a0\u00a0 language was found to contain a section\u00a0\non shipping listing 105 Sumerian terms for\u00a0\u00a0 various ships by their size and purpose.\u00a0\nIn 1956, Professor Samuel Kramer, one of\u00a0\u00a0 the great Sumerologists of our time, reviewed the\u00a0\nliterary legacy found beneath the mounds of Sumer. The table of contents of *From\u00a0\nthe Tablets of Sumer* is a gem\u00a0\u00a0 in itself, for each one of the\u00a0\ntwenty-five chapters described a\u00a0\u00a0 Sumerian \"first,\" including the first schools,\u00a0\nthe first bicameral congress, the first historian,\u00a0\u00a0 the first pharmacopeia, the first \"farmer's\u00a0\nalmanac,\" the first cosmogony and cosmology,\u00a0\u00a0 the first \"job,\" the first proverbs and\u00a0\nsayings, the first literary debates,\u00a0\u00a0 the first \"Noah,\" the first library catalogue, and\u00a0\nman's first heroic age, his first law codes and\u00a0\u00a0 social reforms, his medicine, agriculture,\u00a0\nand search for world peace and harmony. Mesopotamian gods were worshipped\u00a0\nin \"Temple Towns\" as patron deities,\u00a0\u00a0 each town having a temple with a statue of\u00a0\ntheir patron god who resided within. Nannar,\u00a0\u00a0 the patron deity of Ur in modern southern Iraq,\u00a0\nwas revered as the father of Utu and Inanna,\u00a0\u00a0 known as the \"Timekeeper.\" Enlil, the feared\u00a0\ngod of the air and father of Nannar, held the\u00a0\u00a0 title of Yahweh in the Seven Tablets of Creation\u00a0\nand the Epic of Atrahasis. Enlil was the leader\u00a0\u00a0 of the gods on Earth for a time in the Sumerian\u00a0\npantheon, alongside his older half-brother Enki.. The first prestigious schools were established in\u00a0\nSumer as a direct outgrowth of the invention and\u00a0\u00a0 introduction of writing. The archaeological\u00a0\nevidence is actual school buildings and also\u00a0\u00a0 shows indications of a formal system of\u00a0\neducation by the beginning of the third\u00a0\u00a0 millennium B.C. There were literally thousands\u00a0\nof scribes in Sumer, ranging from junior scribes\u00a0\u00a0 to high scribes. Discipline was strict; one\u00a0\nschool alumnus describes on a clay tablet\u00a0\u00a0 how he had been flogged for missing school,\u00a0\nfor insufficient neatness, for loitering,\u00a0\u00a0 for not keeping silent, for misbehaving, and\u00a0\neven for not having appealing handwriting. Eventually, the Sumerians began assigning\u00a0\n\u201cAnnunaki gods\u201d to specific planets in\u00a0\u00a0 the solar system, based on their\u00a0\ncharacteristics and qualities. This\u00a0\u00a0 can elude to the fact that if the\u00a0\nancient alien theory is incorrect,\u00a0\u00a0 then how is it possible that the Sumerians were so\u00a0\naccurate about the planets and the solar system? In the early years of Sumeria..... the Sun is\u00a0\nrepresented by Utu. The Moon is associated with\u00a0\u00a0 Nannar..... Mars is known as Gugulanna, the\u00a0\nBull of Heaven. Mercury is identified with\u00a0\u00a0 Enki....... Jupiter corresponds to Enlil......\u00a0\nand Venus is represented by Inanna. Saturn is\u00a0\u00a0 associated with Ninurta, the Shepherd\u00a0\nand Farmer. The Sumerians created their\u00a0\u00a0 calendar based on a sexagesimal base 60\u00a0\nnumeral system. They defined a circle as\u00a0\u00a0 360 degrees. A lunar year consists of 12 moon\u00a0\ncycles, each 30 days long, totaling 360 days. A celestial year is divided into 12 aspects of\u00a0\nthe night sky, each 30 degrees, also totaling\u00a0\u00a0 360 degrees. A solar year comprises 360 days, each\u00a0\nwith 24 hours, plus five additional days. An hour\u00a0\u00a0 is divided into 60 minutes, and a minute into\u00a0\n60 seconds. The number 360 is divisible by every\u00a0\u00a0 number from 1 to 10, except for 7. Consequently,\u00a0\nseven was regarded as a mysterious number that\u00a0\u00a0 symbolized both chaos and order. They created\u00a0\na 7-day week, based on the 4 phases of the\u00a0\u00a0 moon. The first day of each month began when the\u00a0\ncrescent moon appeared at sunset. The 7th, 14th,\u00a0\u00a0 and 21st were considered auspicious days,\u00a0\nwhere anything could happen. The 28th day\u00a0\u00a0 was a day of rest until another new crescent moon\u00a0\nappeared, which was seen as a sign from the gods. The Sumerians are also credited with the creation\u00a0\nof the first astronomical grid that defined the\u00a0\u00a0 12 aspects of the Zodiac. The stars and\u00a0\nplanets were seen as messengers who held\u00a0\u00a0 vast amounts of information. They were consulted\u00a0\non a continual basis. Twelve signs of the Zodiac. To date, Babylonian astrology was first recorded\u00a0\non 70 cuneiform tablets containing 7,000 messages,\u00a0\u00a0 called Enuma Elish. Which appointed\u00a0\nscribes to record daily tasks,\u00a0\u00a0 and eventually the history of the\u00a0\nSumerians and the Anunnaki ancient aliens. The Fall Equinox occurred in the\u00a0\nseventh moon of \u201cScales,\u201d which\u00a0\u00a0 was later called Libra or \u201cThe Scales of Justice.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0 The \u201cScales\u201d represented the balance between the\u00a0\nSpring and Fall Equinox, when day and night are\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cEqual.\u201d Based on the precession of the equinoxes,\u00a0\nthe autumnal equinox now occurs in Virgo \u201cVirgin.\u201d Amidst the hustle and bustle of urban\u00a0\nlife, the Sumerians revered the Annunaki,\u00a0\u00a0 extraterrestrial deities bearing\u00a0\nhuman-like features and emotions,\u00a0\u00a0 yet tinged with divine complexity, with some\u00a0\nexhibiting traits akin to godly arrogance. The\u00a0\u00a0 Sumerian pantheon boasted a rich tapestry\u00a0\nof gods and goddesses, each with a unique\u00a0\u00a0 domain and rule over the people and cities.\u00a0\nTemples were not merely architectural wonders\u00a0\u00a0 but gateways to the celestial realms, connecting\u00a0\nthe mortal humans to the Annunaki alien rulers\u00a0\u00a0 and kings. Rituals and ceremonies permeated\u00a0\ndaily life, with the ziggurats standing as\u00a0\u00a0 conduits for worship and praise between the\u00a0\nearthly and the Annunaki extraterrestrials. The third region of Sumer was called Ur, which is\u00a0\nthe Akkadian name for Urim; the rulers of Sumer\u00a0\u00a0 and Akkad when the nuclear calamity happened\u00a0\nare known as kings of the Third Dynasty of Ur;\u00a0\u00a0 the biblical \"Ur of the Chaldees\" from which\u00a0\nbiblical Abraham migrated to Harran into the\u00a0\u00a0 land of Canaan, which is modern-day Israel. The\u00a0\ncaananites were the first group of Europeans who\u00a0\u00a0 are also connected to the Hittites, the ancestral\u00a0\nbrothers of the later kingdom of Egypt. Early\u00a0\u00a0 archeologists have found many similarities\u00a0\nbetween Canaanites gods and egyptian gods. The first written histories were written\u00a0\nas epic tales and later evolved into myths,\u00a0\u00a0 the first being called the Epic of Gilgamesh,\u00a0\u00a0 composed in Sumerian around 2100 BCE,\u00a0\nis a literary masterpiece. It narrates\u00a0\u00a0 the adventures of Gilgamesh, a king seeking\u00a0\nimmortality, exploring themes of friendship,\u00a0\u00a0 mortality, and the human condition. The epic is\u00a0\na significant cultural and literary contribution,\u00a0\u00a0 providing insights into Sumerian beliefs,\u00a0\nvalues, and storytelling traditions. Later,\u00a0\u00a0 as the first civilization flourished, the Annunaki\u00a0\nbegan to appoint humans to rule as kings for them,\u00a0\u00a0 which would one day lead to the ideas of pharaohs\u00a0\nin Egypt, communicators to the gods and many times\u00a0\u00a0 their own kin. In their theological pursuits,\u00a0\nthey codified the earliest known legal system,\u00a0\u00a0 the Code of Ur-Nammu, ushering in an\u00a0\nera of societal order and justice. The Sumerians documented advanced\u00a0\nmedical knowledge on clay tablets,\u00a0\u00a0 revealing a sophisticated understanding of\u00a0\ndiseases and treatments. The Diagnostic Handbook,\u00a0\u00a0 a compendium of symptoms and treatments, showcases\u00a0\ntheir medical expertise. Surgical instruments,\u00a0\u00a0 such as bronze lancets, were used in\u00a0\nmedical procedures. The Sumerians'\u00a0\u00a0 medical knowledge laid the foundation\u00a0\nfor future advancements in the field. Sumer's economy thrived on agriculture, supported\u00a0\nby an advanced irrigation system. The fertile soil\u00a0\u00a0 yielded crops like barley and wheat. The\u00a0\nsurplus allowed for trade with neighboring\u00a0\u00a0 regions, fostering economic prosperity.\u00a0\nSumerians engaged in barter and trade,\u00a0\u00a0 exchanging goods such as textiles, metals,\u00a0\nand agricultural products. This economic\u00a0\u00a0 foundation facilitated the\u00a0\ngrowth of urban centers. Their society was structured hierarchically. At\u00a0\nthe top were priests and kings, followed by free\u00a0\u00a0 citizens, and then slaves. The city-states had\u00a0\nadministrative structures overseeing taxation,\u00a0\u00a0 justice, and defense. Labor specialization was\u00a0\na hallmark, with individuals mastering specific\u00a0\u00a0 trades, from metalworking and pottery to\u00a0\nfarming and writing. This specialization\u00a0\u00a0 contributed to the economic and technological\u00a0\nadvancements of Sumer. In ancient civilizations,\u00a0\u00a0 it is believed that much of the Sumerians'\u00a0\nknowledge was imparted to the Annunaki as\u00a0\u00a0 well. The Sumerian pantheon of gods, who were\u00a0\nrecognized as myths but are now believed to be\u00a0\u00a0 interdimensional extraterrestrials, consists\u00a0\nof the basis of all religions and mythologies\u00a0\u00a0 on the planet. The holy father and king\u00a0\nof all gods is King Anu of Nibiru. Enki,\u00a0\u00a0 also known as Ea, was the god of water and\u00a0\nearth, which was named after him. Enlil,\u00a0\u00a0 his youngest, was given rulership of all earth\u00a0\nand the early cities of Sumer and Babylon. During this time, the gods and men lived among\u00a0\neach other. The Annunaki made the earthlings\u00a0\u00a0 worship them in song. They constructed temples\u00a0\nfor food offerings and praising concerts, even\u00a0\u00a0 the king of the cosmos King Anu had a temple built\u00a0\nin his name when he descended from the heavenly\u00a0\u00a0 motherships. The praising and worship would give\u00a0\nenergy and power to them, especially in song and\u00a0\u00a0 poem. It is believed by this time, the worship\u00a0\ngene was implanted in the Human DNA chromosomes. According to Zacharia Sitchin's excerptions, The\u00a0\nSumerians were the world's most ancient earliest\u00a0\u00a0 multicultural inhabitants of Mesopotamia\u00a0\nbefore the great flood. All of humanity was\u00a0\u00a0 mostly dark-melanated until the birth of Zisdura,\u00a0\nbiblical Noah. The Sumerians primarily had dark\u00a0\u00a0 and brown skin, brown hair, and some Sumerian\u00a0\nroyals had blonde hair, blue or green eyes,\u00a0\u00a0 with dark or light skin. The Sumerian people were\u00a0\nreferred to as the \"Adamites\" by the Igigi watcher\u00a0\u00a0 Anunnaki. They were credited with remarkable\u00a0\ningenuity by these extraterrestrial beings,\u00a0\u00a0 often likened to dark North African peoples\u00a0\nlike Ethiopians and dark and light melanated\u00a0\u00a0 African Asiatic and Israelian peoples, believed\u00a0\nto be the common ancestors of all modern humans,\u00a0\u00a0 with the oldest hominid skeleton to date being\u00a0\nfound in East Africa by anthropologists. The\u00a0\u00a0 Sumerians were known for stylizing their hair\u00a0\nto resemble the styles of the warrior gods;\u00a0\u00a0 this was the style of braiding or dreading\u00a0\nin ancient indigenous, African, and Nordic\u00a0\u00a0 cultures. According to ancient texts, the\u00a0\nskin of earthlings was genetically marked\u00a0\u00a0 into 48 shades of the Mesopotamian genomes,\u00a0\nand the biblical Noah, known as Zisudra,\u00a0\u00a0 was a giant man with albinism and a king of\u00a0\na region of Sumer. His line is where many of\u00a0\u00a0 Indo-European and Asiatic descent originate,\u00a0\nalongside biblical Cain. References in ancient\u00a0\u00a0 texts such as the Egyptian Book of the Dead and\u00a0\nSitchin's *Lost Book of Enki* depict the \"black\"\u00a0\u00a0 lands of the Sumerians, governed by Dumuzi, Enki's\u00a0\nyoungest Anunnaki son and the god of water. Enki,\u00a0\u00a0 the prince of Earth and Nibiru, is known for being\u00a0\ndark violet-skinned or sometimes shades of blue,\u00a0\u00a0 green, or gold. In the Vedic texts of the\u00a0\n*Mahabharata*, Krishna, who is the equivalent\u00a0\u00a0 of Enki, was mentioned as \u201cNeela megha shyama,\u201d\u00a0\nwhich means dark blue as rain-filled clouds. The Vedic texts describe gods bearing children\u00a0\nwith humans, resulting in offspring with varying\u00a0\u00a0 skin tones and features, from extremely bright\u00a0\nwith little melanin to extremely dark with\u00a0\u00a0 harsh melanin, including blonde hair and various\u00a0\neye colors. Both the Sumerians and Vedic texts\u00a0\u00a0 mention that without dark colors, there would\u00a0\nbe no shades of lighter colors in skin tones. An ancient Sumerian psalm venerates Enlil, the\u00a0\nalien god of Sumer: \"Lord who knows the destiny\u00a0\u00a0 of the land. Trustworthy in his calling: Enlil\u00a0\nwho knows the destiny of Sumer, Trustworthy in his\u00a0\u00a0 calling, Father Enlil, Lord of all the lands, Lord\u00a0\nof the rightful commands, Father Enlil, Shepherd\u00a0\u00a0 of the black and brown-headed ones, we shall never\u00a0\nleave the dark lands of the sun. From the mountain\u00a0\u00a0 of Sunrise to the mountain of sunset. There is\u00a0\nno other lord in the land, you alone are king.\" The Sumerians revered Enlil out of\u00a0\nboth fear and gratitude. Enlil and\u00a0\u00a0 his offspring later became gods of the\u00a0\nIndo-European Hittites and Canaanites,\u00a0\u00a0 during the beginnings of Babylon and Assyria. In\u00a0\nBiblical texts, Enlil and his son Ninurta take\u00a0\u00a0 on the title of Yahweh. Enlil\u2019s brother, Enki,\u00a0\nreferred to as a snake, revealed the truth of\u00a0\u00a0 good and evil to Adamu and Eve and ruled for\u00a0\nthousands of years before the great flood. The Seven tablets of creation describe\u00a0\nEarth being divided into regions by the\u00a0\u00a0 royal family of Anu. The first region,\u00a0\nKemet, was inhabited by Sumerians,\u00a0\u00a0 who later migrated to become the original\u00a0\nEgyptians under Thoth, the god of Israel,\u00a0\u00a0 and later Amun Ra, the son of Enki. The second\u00a0\nregion, Sumer, was allotted to Enlil's sons,\u00a0\u00a0 who became the gods of Israel. The third region\u00a0\nwas given to Utu and Zisudra...biblical Noah,\u00a0\u00a0 who was albino and his descendants. Sumerian\u00a0\ngenetic markers, influenced by Ninurta and\u00a0\u00a0 Nannar, led to the emergence of light and\u00a0\nbrown-skinned Asiatic Indo-European people,\u00a0\u00a0 descendants of Noah and Cain. These people,\u00a0\nrelocated by the annunaki goddess Inanna,\u00a0\u00a0 spread across Asia Minor, the Aryan Caucasus\u00a0\nMountains, the Aegean Sea, and modern-day\u00a0\u00a0 Israel formerly Canaan. Ninurta genetically\u00a0\nmodified them to adapt to harsh, colder climates,\u00a0\u00a0 establishing multiple cultures and languages. To\u00a0\nkeep track of the God's activities on earth, it\u00a0\u00a0 is theorized the Annunaki and temple bureaucrats\u00a0\ndeveloped an early writing system around 3300 BC,\u00a0\u00a0 using small clay tablets. This first writing,\u00a0\ncalled proto-cuneiform, used pictographs to record\u00a0\u00a0 the origin story of humans, the history of the\u00a0\nAnnunaki, the transfer of commodities like grain,\u00a0\u00a0 beer, and livestock. It had over 700 signs and\u00a0\nlikely evolved from a more primitive system. The\u00a0\u00a0 pictographs were simple, such as a bull's head for\u00a0\ncattle or a barley stalk for barley. Some symbols'\u00a0\u00a0 meanings were clearer when paired with others,\u00a0\nlike a bowl and a human head to mean \"eat.\" \n \n \n  Over time, these signs evolved into cuneiform,\u00a0\nwhich used wedge-shaped impressions made with a\u00a0\u00a0 reed stylus on clay tablets. These tablets were\u00a0\nthen dried in the sun to make the impressions\u00a0\u00a0 permanent. Cuneiform was suitable for the\u00a0\nSumerian language because most Sumerian words\u00a0\u00a0 were monosyllabic, allowing nearly every word to\u00a0\nbe represented by a single symbol. Discoveries\u00a0\u00a0 and translations of cuneiform documents give\u00a0\nus insights into ancient Mesopotamian life.\u00a0\u00a0 Cylinder seals were another communication\u00a0\ntool. Made from materials like stone, clay,\u00a0\u00a0 metal, bone, or ivory, they had designs carved\u00a0\ninto them. Rolling a cylinder seal across wet\u00a0\u00a0 clay produced a continuous impression,\u00a0\nused to seal storeroom locks, goods,\u00a0\u00a0 and important documents, often confirming\u00a0\nthe sender's identity or authority. \n \n \n  The influence of the Uruk culture spread\u00a0\nthroughout the ancient Near East between the 4th\u00a0\u00a0 and 3rd centuries BC. Archaeologists have found\u00a0\nUruk-style pottery and architecture in Syria,\u00a0\u00a0 Iran, and Turkey, brought by trading colonies that\u00a0\nsought raw materials like copper, obsidian, lead,\u00a0\u00a0 gold, silver, wood, and stone. Eventually, they\u00a0\neven imported tin for bronze-making. Before kings\u00a0\u00a0 appeared in Mesopotamia, high-ranking priests\u00a0\nheld power. They organized the population,\u00a0\u00a0 collected taxes, and distributed goods and\u00a0\nservices, believed to directly represent\u00a0\u00a0 the gods or understand their desires. Divine\u00a0\nintervention alone couldn\u2019t protect people from\u00a0\u00a0 foreign enemies. Priests and priestesses,\u00a0\nthough pious, were not necessarily good\u00a0\u00a0 warriors or military strategists. As cities grew,\u00a0\ncompetition for resources and farmland increased,\u00a0\u00a0 leading to conflicts between city-states. Strong\u00a0\nleaders were needed to lead men into battle,\u00a0\u00a0 likely giving rise to the first kings\u00a0\nin ancient Mesopotamia. Initially,\u00a0\u00a0 kings might have been temporary war leaders,\u00a0\nbut by 2900 BC, kingship became hereditary,\u00a0\u00a0 marking the start of the Early Dynastic\u00a0\nPeriod, which lasted nearly 600 years. \n \n \n  Rulers had titles like \"en\" meaning lord, \"ensi\"\u00a0\nmeaning governor or local king and \"lugal\"\u00a0\u00a0 meaning great king. A lugal might rule over\u00a0\nmultiple cities, with several ensi's governing\u00a0\u00a0 on his behalf. Cities were often surrounded by\u00a0\nhigh walls to protect temples, administrative\u00a0\u00a0 buildings, palaces, houses, and residents.\u00a0\nThe most important structure was the ziggurat,\u00a0\u00a0 a large, step-pyramid temple, considered the\u00a0\nearthly home of the city's patron god. It\u00a0\u00a0 was run by priests and was the city's chief\u00a0\nlandowner and wealthiest institution. \n \n \n  Sumerian gods, like later Greek and Roman\u00a0\nones, took human form and behaved like people,\u00a0\u00a0 with emotions and occasional interference in\u00a0\nhuman affairs. There were gods for various\u00a0\u00a0 aspects of life and nature, such as the sky, sun,\u00a0\nmoon, plow, bricks, and writing. An, the sky god,\u00a0\u00a0 had his main temple in Uruk, but the city\u2019s\u00a0\npatron deity was Inanna, the goddess of love\u00a0\u00a0 and war. By the Early Dynastic Period, Enlil,\u00a0\nthe god of air, was considered the most powerful,\u00a0\u00a0 with his sanctuary in Nippur. Enki, the\u00a0\ngod of fresh water and patron of Eridu,\u00a0\u00a0 Utu, the sun god associated with justice\u00a0\nand patron of Sippar and Larsa, and Nanna,\u00a0\u00a0 the moon god and patron of Ur, were also\u00a0\nimportant deities. Ningirsu, associated\u00a0\u00a0 with farming and war, was the patron deity of\u00a0\nLagash, with his main temple in Girsu. \n \n \n  By 2500 BC, royal inscriptions and portraits\u00a0\nof individual kings appeared, helping us\u00a0\u00a0 understand Sumer\u2019s political history. One early\u00a0\ninscription depicts Ur-Nanshe, ruler of Lagash,\u00a0\u00a0 who reigned around 2494 to 2465 BC. One famous\u00a0\ndepiction of him is a limestone relief. The king,\u00a0\u00a0 depicted with a basket of clay bricks on his\u00a0\nhead, is currently in the Louvre. This relief\u00a0\u00a0 shows him performing one of his key religious\u00a0\nduties: caring for his kingdom's temples,\u00a0\u00a0 especially those dedicated to Ningirsu, Lagash's\u00a0\npatron deity. Ur-Nanshe also served as Lagash's\u00a0\u00a0 military leader, engaging in wars with\u00a0\nneighboring city-states like Ur and Umma. In the 24th century BC, Lagash, once strong\u00a0\nunder kings like Ur-Nanshe, fell under priestly\u00a0\u00a0 control. The priests, including ruler Lugalanda,\u00a0\nimposed heavy taxes, leading to widespread debt\u00a0\u00a0 and corruption. This hardship caused parents to\u00a0\nsell their children into slavery to pay debts. After six years, Urukagina overthrew Lugalanda,\u00a0\nreformed Lagash, and possibly introduced the\u00a0\u00a0 first written code of laws. These reforms aimed to\u00a0\nprotect common people from exploitation. However,\u00a0\u00a0 Lagash's weakness invited attack. In 2341\u00a0\nBC, Lugalzagesi of Umma conquered Lagash,\u00a0\u00a0 destroying its capital and temples,\u00a0\nincluding Ningirsu's. A scribe from\u00a0\u00a0 Lagash cursed Lugalzagesi for the\u00a0\ndestruction, lamenting the city's fate. Lugalzagesi claimed to control all of Sumer,\u00a0\nboasting an empire from the Persian Gulf to\u00a0\u00a0 the Mediterranean. However, modern scholars\u00a0\ndoubt he truly ruled all the lands he claimed. Sargon of Akkad, also known as Sargon the\u00a0\nGreat, was a seminal figure in ancient\u00a0\u00a0 Mesopotamian history. Born around 2334 BCE,\u00a0\nSargon rose from humble origins to establish\u00a0\u00a0 the Akkadian Empire, becoming one of history\u2019s\u00a0\nfirst great conquerors. According to legend,\u00a0\u00a0 Sargon was born to a lowly family and cast\u00a0\nadrift in a basket on the Euphrates River,\u00a0\u00a0 where he was found and raised by a gardener. He\u00a0\neventually became the cup-bearer to Ur-Zababa, the\u00a0\u00a0 king of Kish, a position of considerable influence\u00a0\nthat set the stage for his rise to power. Sargon\u2019s rise to prominence began with his\u00a0\ndefeat of Lugalzagesi, the ruler of Umma,\u00a0\u00a0 who had united much of Sumer under his control.\u00a0\nWith Lugalzagesi\u2019s defeat, Sargon established the\u00a0\u00a0 Akkadian Empire, the first empire in history to\u00a0\nencompass multiple city-states and regions. His\u00a0\u00a0 empire extended across Mesopotamia and into\u00a0\nneighboring territories, marking the first\u00a0\u00a0 time a single ruler controlled such a vast\u00a0\nexpanse. Sargon\u2019s administrative reforms,\u00a0\u00a0 including the establishment of Akkadian as the\u00a0\nofficial language and the centralization of power,\u00a0\u00a0 laid the groundwork for a new era of\u00a0\nimperial rule in the ancient Middle East. In addition to his military and administrative\u00a0\nachievements, Sargon is believed to have had\u00a0\u00a0 a significant personal connection with the\u00a0\ndivine Annunaki. According to some accounts,\u00a0\u00a0 he mated with the warrior goddess Inanna, also\u00a0\nknown as Ishtar. This union supposedly produced\u00a0\u00a0 Enheduanna, a demi-goddess and high priestess\u00a0\nwho would leave an indelible mark on history. Enheduanna, born around 2285 BCE, was an ancient\u00a0\nMesopotamian high priestess and the worlds first\u00a0\u00a0 known poet. She is recognized as the earliest\u00a0\nknown female author in history, credited with\u00a0\u00a0 composing hymns and poems dedicated to the goddess\u00a0\nInanna. Enheduanna\u2019s literary works, known as the\u00a0\u00a0 \"Sumerian Temple Hymns\" and \"The Exaltation of\u00a0\nInanna,\" are notable for their deep religious and\u00a0\u00a0 emotional themes, providing a profound insight\u00a0\ninto Sumerian spirituality and culture. As\u00a0\u00a0 the high priestess of the moon god Nanna in the\u00a0\ncity of Ur, Enheduanna held a position of great\u00a0\u00a0 religious and political influence. Her writings\u00a0\nnot only express her devotion to Inanna but also\u00a0\u00a0 reflect the complex interplay between the divine\u00a0\nand the earthly realms in Sumerian thought. One\u00a0\u00a0 of her most popular hyms and poems is titled \"The\u00a0\nLady Of The Largest Heart\". The poem reads....... \"Lady of all powers In whom light appears....\u00a0\nRadiant one Beloved of Heaven and Earth.....\u00a0\u00a0 Tiara-crowned Priestess of the Highest\u00a0\nGod, My Lady......... you are the guardian\u00a0\u00a0 Of all greatness.

You lift the powers of being,\u00a0\u00a0 You have hung them over your fingers,\u00a0\nYou have gathered the many powers,\u00a0\u00a0 You have clasped them like necklaces onto your\u00a0\nbreast. Like a dragon, You poisoned the land\u00a0\u00a0 when you roared at the earth In your thunder,\u00a0\nNothing green could live. A flood fell from the\u00a0\u00a0 mountain........... You, Inanna, Foremost\u00a0\nin Heaven and Earth. Lady riding a beast,\u00a0\u00a0 You rained fire on the heads of men. Taking\u00a0\nyour power from the Highest..... Following\u00a0\u00a0 the commands of the highest....

Like a\u00a0\ncharging storm....... You charge, Like a roaring\u00a0\u00a0 storm You roar....... You thunder in thunder,\u00a0\nSnort in rampaging winds........ Your feet are\u00a0\u00a0 continually restless. Carrying your harp of sighs,\u00a0\nYou breathe out the music of mourning.........\u00a0\u00a0 It was in your service That I first entered\u00a0\nThe holy temple, I, Enheduanna, The highest\u00a0\u00a0 priestess. I carried the ritual basket, I chanted\u00a0\nyour praise....... Now I have been cast out To the\u00a0\u00a0 place of lepers. Day comes..... And the brightness\u00a0\nIs hidden around me. Shadows cover the light.....\u00a0\u00a0 Drape it in sandstorms...... My beautiful mouth\u00a0\nknows only confusion. Even my sex is dust....\" The Sumerians being the templates for humanity\u00a0\nwe know today is still a new discovery,\u00a0\u00a0 but once many learn about this ancient society\u00a0\nand see how every human person derives from\u00a0\u00a0 this civilization based upon the archaeological,\u00a0\nanthropological, and genetic genealogy discoveries\u00a0\u00a0 in the past 150 years. This history reveals a\u00a0\nnew engineered humanoid species taught great\u00a0\u00a0 power and technology but led astray by false\u00a0\ngods who were ancient aliens with advanced\u00a0\u00a0 technology and possibly the great mythological\u00a0\nsunken city of Atlantis and Lemuria. However,\u00a0\u00a0 it also suggests that humans have the\u00a0\npotential to surpass not only advanced\u00a0\u00a0 extraterrestrials technologically but also\u00a0\nspiritually. Understanding humanity's first\u00a0\u00a0 civilization and past can help us resist\u00a0\nelite manipulation and stay on the path of\u00a0\u00a0 light in the universe, as all beings are\u00a0\nconnected and come from the same source.\u00a0\u00a0 The power to shape reality lies within\u00a0\nhumanity, gifted by the creator of all.
