"welcome to the channel today we're going to talk about something very very old very ancient and very mysterious our topic for today is the religion of Mesopotamia that land in modern day Iraq shrouded in mystery I invite you to make yourself comfortable perhaps get yourself a little drink or if you do so feel inclined to close your eyes and Drift Off to Sleep as you listen to the story that I will tell you and so now let's begin as we delve into Mesopotamian religion mesop amian religion the spiritual framework of ancient Mesopotamia span the cultural epics of Sumer akad Assyria and Babylonia flourishing from around 6,000 BC to 400 ad notably resiliant Mesopotamian religious Traditions displayed coherence and adaptability over the Millennia the earliest inklings of Mesopotamian religious thought emerged in the sixth millennium BC coinciding with the religion's transition to permanent settlement the Advent of writing in the mid4 millennium BC signaled the Inception of Mesopotamian religious records centered on venerating natural forces as vital bestowers of sustance these early beliefs were grounded in an animistic worldview attributing spiritual significance to elements of the natural world by the third millennium BC there was a notable Evolution as abstract forces transformed into a diverse Pantheon of personified deities each associated ated with specific functions and aspects of life this period saw the development of city states each with its Patron god or goddess reflecting the sociopolitical landscape of the time these subsequent stages of Mesopotamian polytheism spanning the second and first Millennia BC witnessed a nuanced shift the religious Focus shifted towards more personal forms of worship and the gods were organized into hierarchical structure with a national God assuming a prominent role at the head of the pantheon this period also saw the development of elaborate myths rituals and the construction of impressive ziggurats as sacred precincts however the decline of Mesopotamian religion was imminent with the Advent of external influences during the ayid Empire the spread of Iranian religions exerted a transformative impact on Mesopotamian religious practices subsequently the christianization of Mesopotamia further contributed to the decline of the ancient religious Traditions that had held for a millennia despite its decline the legacy of Mesopotamian religion continues to be a subject of scholarly study and Fascination providing insights into the cultural and spiritual fabric of one of the world's earliest civilizations the earliest roots of Mesopotamian religious thought are traced back to the first half of the sixth millennium BC coinciding with the period when people began settling permanently in Mesopotamia due to the improved irrigation practices unfortunately the specifics of these early religious developments are as till now UPN un unknown as they predate the invention of writing so we must take some things with a grain of salt and perhaps use our imagination the inhabitants of Mesopotamia consisted of two primary linguistic groups the East semetic speakers of Acadian and the samarians who spoke Samarian A Lang language isolate the samarians credited with founding the ubed civilization During the ubid period 65 BC to 3800 BC left the first written records over time they migrated to southern Mesopotamia known as smar and exerted significant influence on the Acadian speakers Acadian speakers are believed to have entered the region between 3500 BC and 3,000 BC as evidenced by Acadian names appearing in the Regal lists of Mesopotamian states around the 29th Century BC the samarians were a highly Advanced civilization at least for the time credited with numerous achievements such as inventing writing early forms of mathematics wheel Vehicles astronomy astrology a written code of law organized medicine Advanced Agriculture and many architectural Innovations they established the first city States including Burak Ur lagash isin Kish sear napur and many more each ruled by their local King called an NC the samarians maintained dominance until the rise of the Acadian empire under Saron ofad one of early history's greatest conquerors around 2335 BC unifying all of Mesopotamia under a single ruler as cultural interactions intensified syncretism between Sumerian and Acadian cultures and deities became more pronounced the acadians while favoring a smaller Pantheon elev ated their deities to Greater positions of power in this syncretic religious landscape the religious beliefs of the Assyrians played a significant role in shaping their political structure particularly in the early stages of Assyria history unlike a traditional monarchy Assyria initially functioned as an oligarchy with authority distributed among three main centers of Power number one being the Assembly of Elders which consisted of influential Elders who collectively held Authority decision-making processes and governance were carried out within this assembly hereditary ruler the ruler dis despite having hereditary status did not bear the title of King sarum instead the ruler was referred to as the steward of assur the term King was reserved for the city's Patron deity ashure of whom the ruler also held the position of high priest so every city had its own Patron God and that Patron God was the ruler of the city the human ruler that living breathing element was only the messenger and for the name the steward and last being the eponym the eponym annually elected by lot played a crucial role in in economic Administration this official was responsible for administering the city's economy including the power to detain individuals and even confiscate people's property I'm sure he was very popular the ruler's designation as the steward of assur and the role of the eponym persisted as s monial vestiges throughout the history of the Assyrian monarchy the use of the term King exclusively for the city's Patron deity ashure underscored the close connection between religious and political Authority this early political structure reflected the influence of religious beliefs on the distribution of Power with within ass Syrian Society in the Neo Assyrian Empire religion played a central role and the Assyrian King's Authority was intricately linked to the concept of divine mandate while the Assyrian King was not considered a God himself he was recognized as the chief servant of the chief God ashur the belief granted the king absolute Authority contingent on the high priest assuring the people that the gods or in the case of henotheistic Assyrians the god asure were pleased with the current ruler so some somewhat like the Mandate of Heaven system in China if the gods were angry at you you know you would have things like droughts and plagues and locusts flying around everywhere all those horrible things that we have to put up in terms of natural disasters it would be a signal for the people to uh get a new ruler and perhaps it was indicative of you not doing your job correctly whether that was true or not remains to be seen now for the Assyrians residing in assur and surrounding areas assur being a province this religious and political system was completely normal for them and had been for so many years however for the conquered peoples he a newly conquered people of Saron bakad who had just joined into this new Empire especially those from smaller city states it represented a new and very strange form of governance over time asure transitioned from being the local deity of assur to the overlord of the expansive Assyrian domain stretching from the caucuses and Armenia into the north of Egypt Nubia and even out to the Arabian peninsula in the South the Empire also extended from Cyprus and the Eastern Mediterranean Sea in the west to Central Iran in the East the patron deity of assur ashur so the God is called ashur the place is called assur little confusing I know engaged in constant rivalry with the patron deity of Babylon Marduk worshiped in ashur's name was conducted across the lands dominated by the Assyrians the widespread veneration of ashur across the fertile cresant allowed the Assyrian King to command the Loyalty of his subjects as they were considered fellow Servants of Aur this religious framework reinforced the king's Authority and Justified his rule throughout the vast Assyrian Empire Mesopotamian religious cosmology lacks specific written records however modern Scholars have attempted to reconstruct a plausible depiction based on various counts one significant source is the Epic of creation and it dates all the way back to 1200 BC so more than 3,000 years ago aren't we so lucky that we still have access to some of these documents according to this epic the god maduk defeated the mother goddess Tiamat using her body to create the Earth the Heavenly Paradise of Samu and the Nether world of iitu so we can see from here that the tradition of having the world being created by God and having a upper world and a lower world one being the paradise and one being the uh the hellish punishment it's a long tradition goes back many many years really makes you think huh so in this cosmological framework the universe was perceived as a spheroid during a similar period with the three levels of Samu where the gods resided and the Stars existed beneath these Heavenly Realms were three levels of the earth while the specific ific details might vary these accounts offer insights into Mesopotamian beliefs about the structure of the cosmos and the Divine forces that shaped it Mesopotamian religion was both polytheistic and henotheistic acknowledging the existence of new numerous deities which certain Gods considered Superior by specific devotees devotees often Associated themselves with a particular City or city state that revered a specific tuary deity for example enki was linked to the city of eridu Asher with assur and Assyria and enil with ishar with arella and Muk with Babylon he was that one where they were always talking badly about yeah they didn't like Marduk very much I have seen them in concert three times though I will add they're a band I dug ass while the exact number of gods and goddesses in Mesopotamia remains unknown Scholars of estimate around 2,400 of them existed most of whom had Samarian names this is an amount of gods that does not rival groups like Shintoism but is certainly up there with the some Hindu Traditions they seem to keep expanding the list certainly makes things interesting so in the Sumerian language which I obviously cannot pronounce very well and I challenge you to do any better gods were called dingar and in Acadian they were referred to as ilu syncretism between the gods woried by these groups led to the adoption of each other's deities kind of in the same way that the Romans and Greeks got along Mesopotamian gods were anthropomorph sharing similarities with humans such as the need for food drink and even experiencing the effects of alcohol however they were considered more powerful allseeing all knowing and most importantly Immortal the gods were often depicted as having a terrifying brightness inspiring a and reverence among humans these deities formed family relations a common trait in polytheistic religions while the Mesopotamian gods were not viewed mystically they were seen as authoritative figures to be obeyed and feared rather than adored despite this many Mesopotamians across various social classes often had names dedicated to specific deities a practice that emerged among the samarians in the third millennium BC and continued among the acadians Assyrians and the Babylonians in the early stages of Mesopotamian religion the pantheon lacked a specific order but later theologians in roduced the concept of ranking deities based on their importance a Sumerian List dating to around 2600 BC discovered at farm and Tel Abu salabi ranks approximately 560 deities and emphasize the five primary deities of that region enlil a significantly early Mesopotamian deity was actually initially a Sumerian god regarded as the king of the Gods and controller of the world he was later adopted by the acadians another crucial deity was the Samaran God an later known as Anu among the cadians serving a role that was similar to enlil the Samarian God enki associated with wisdom and water was also adopted by the acadians as a that's the spelling E A the Samaran Moon god Nana became the aradian sin and the sun god utu became the aradian shamash inana a prominent Sumerian goddess associated with sex and War was also noteworthy with the rise of the Babylonians in the 18th century BC King hamurabi elevated the previously less significant deity Muk to a position of Supremacy alongside Anu and enlil in southern Mesopotamia now perhaps you recognize the name hamurabi he was the king in the ancient times that wrote the first written laws put that all in so it was very clear for everybody the Epic of Gilgamesh which I'm sure you've heard of the as well a significant Legend from Mesopotamian religion it recounts the tale of King gilgamesh's quest for immortality and his relationship with the gods this epic contains the earliest reference to the great flood now the flood uh I suppose we can't really call it a myth this proved that a flood had happened but um drastically blown out of proportions in Many religious texts and uh mythologized but uh you will find the flood in most if not all of those old texts at the time they will all make reference to it so the Acadian religion occasionally Drew inspiration from influential Samarian religious leaders and beliefs deifying Samaran Kings at certain points in its development and back to some modernday discoveries actually in the very recent March of 2020 where archaeologists made a noteworthy Discovery at the site of gearu they actually managed to unveil a 5,000 year old cultic area containing over 300 broken ceremonial ceramic cups bowls jws animal bones and even evidence of ritual processions dedicated to the God niru Among the artifacts was a duck-shaped bronze figurine with eyes made from bark believed to be a dedication to the goddess nanha this find provides valuable insights into the religious practices and rituals of ancient Mesopotamians the cultic practices in Mesopotamia were closely tied to the concept of each City having its own Patron deity prominent deities served as patrons for specific cities and temples constructed in the form of ziggurats that was kind of like a big stepped pyramid were dedicated to these Gods so these ziggurats rising in a series of stepped stages and Terror es held a significant symbolism often considered a means for the god to descend from and Ascend to the heavens the heavens of course being the paradise where the gods were some theories even suggest that the entire Temple especially the upper part may have been regarded as a colossal Altar for cultic practices could be the Temple of eni in eridu is an example of a Mesopotamian Temple containing a holy tree within a sacred grove this tree and Grove were Central to various rights performed by the king who played a role of a Master Gardener the ziggurats were a Monumental structure and their construction and symbolism have sparked extensive discussions among Scholars originally Mesopotamian temples were constructed as Dwelling Places for the gods symbolized by an image of the deity placed in a separate room the presence of the God within the image was considered concrete and rituals were conducted to concentrate the idols nocturnal rituals involving giving life to the idols opening their mouths and washing them if the deity approved it was believed to inhabit the image these temples were equipped to serve the gods featuring households with kitchens sleeping rooms and side rooms for the dei's family additionally there were Courtyards with basins for cleansing visitors and stables for the gods Chariot and draft animals the arrangements of these facilities reflected the belief that the gods physically resided in the temple and the temple staff attended to their needs the well-being of Mesopotamian Gods was maintained through various services and rites rituals performed in the temples regular Banquets offered twice a day were prepared for the dei's image the exact manner in which the gods were thought to consume the food is to this point unknown but a curtain was drawn before the table similar to how the king concealed himself from the public while eating incense was burned before the image as it was believed that the gods actually enjoyed the fragrance of it sacrificial meals were also common practice with animals offered as substitutes for humans this substitution was seen as redirecting the anger of the gods or demons towards the sacrificial animal addition addtionally specific days required extra sacrifices and ceremonies dedicated to particular Gods each day though was considered sacred to a specific deity so maybe one month you would have a day to enlil another month you would have a day to sin or Nana or one of these other gods in theory the king heled the role of the religious leader of the cult the king performed various duties within the temple overseeing a team of Specialists who meditated mediated rather between humans and gods these Specialists included a supervisor a priest and other priests for individual purification against demons and magicians too they would also have different priests there that were solely in charge of purifying the temple it also have female singers and musicians along with male singers too Craftsmen swords bearers masters of divination and all sorts of other people each had a specific role in maintaining the sacred rituals and services within the temple in addition to public rituals dedicated to the gods individuals in Mesopotamia also engaged in personal worship of a deity personal Gods often changing over time were rarely named or described in early practices by the mid third millennium BC some rulers considered specific Gods their personal protectors kind of like a guardian angel in the second millennium BC personal Gods played a more significant role for the Common People fostering a close personal relationship maintained through prayer and the care of the God's statue surviving written prayers from ancient Mesopotamia exalt specific Gods above others reflecting extreme reverence profound devotion and deep emotional connections to the supernatural while these prayers convey a sense of fear toward the gods they were believed to bring good luck success and protection from disease and demons and individuals place and success in society were thought to depend on their personal deity who influence their talents and personalities Mesopotamians also strongly believed in demons and individuals like Temple priests participated in incantations to Ward them off demons were considered harmful and dangerous forces providing an explanation for the existence of evil in the world the spirits of the Dead were also believed to hang around and cause Mischief amulets special priests or exorcists incantations and ceremonies were employed to combat demonic activity and cured diseases associated with it divination was widespread among private individuals who believe that the gods had predetermined humans destinies observing Omens casting lots interpreting dreams and various other forms of divination such as Lancy which is kind of Dripping oil into water and looking at the shap Extasy which is reading the sacrificial animal entrails you might have seen it in some movies like year one right aury which is observing bird Behavior and astrology which is of course as we all know looking at the stars uh all these methods were used to ascertain the future and try and make sense of things different classes of priests including askers observers and ecstatic Sears were involved in interpreting these signs and communicating the God's will in Mesopotamian religious beliefs while ancient paganism emphasized Duty and ritual over morality certain moral virtues can be inferred from surviving prayers and myths man was thought to have originated as a Divine creation and the gods were considered the source of Life holding power over sickness Health and Human Destinies personal names for reflected the idea that each child was a gift from the Divine humans were believed to have been created to serve the gods emphasizing their roles of fear and appropriate attitudes towards a Divine duties were primarily of a cultic and ritual nature and prayers Som times expressed positive psychological relationships or conversion experiences with Gods the reward for mankind was generally described as success and long life individuals also had moral duties toward fellow humans particularly the king's duties to his subjects the gods were believed to Grant power to to the king for the exercise of justice and righteousness characterized as straightness rightness firmness and Truth moral guidelines included avoiding actions that cause dissension promoting Justice freeing innocent prisoners honesty in trade and respecting boundaries and property rights now we have in modern Christian theology if you are so inclined that way the expression of the word sin now of course we have this in Mesopotamian religion as well as was the origin of much of the Christian tradition that we have in our modern day uh along with many other judeo-christian religions that stem from it uh in the Mesopotamian tradition sin was expressed through words like mistake rebellion and curse and was often linked to the idea of rebellion against the divines sin was considered anything that incurred the Wrath of the gods or LED to punishment in the form of sickness and Misfortune punishment was seen as retribution for transgressing divine prohibitions sometimes without knowledge of specific sins Mesopotamian literature often treated war and natural disasters as punishments from the gods with Kings serving as tools for the God's Deliverance Samarian myths hinted at a Prohibition against premarital sex and marriages were typically arranged by parents in advance premarital sex was of course likely common but a very discreet thing the worship of inana or ishar involved wild frenzy dancing and ritual celebrations often challenging social and physical Norms of course when people dance they tend to get close and when people get close the rest rights itself inana or Ishtar was believed to transcend human limitations allowing individuals to enter a trans world of spiritual ecstasy by depicting transgressions of normal societal or gender boundaries the ancient mamans believed in afterlife which was envisioned as a land Bel low our world known by various names like aralu ganzer or ialo the latter meaning the great below this realm was considered the destination for everyone after death regardless of their social status or actions during their lifetime unlike the concept of Christian hell Mesopotamian underworld was not viewed as a place of punishment or reward the condition of the deceased in the Underworld was not regarded as equivalent to the Earthly life they had enjoyed instead they were considered Weak and Powerless ghosts myths such as ishta's descent into the underworld describe the afterlife as a place where the dead consumed dust and Clay as their nourishment Living In Perpetual Darkness without seeing any light narratives like the adapa myth convey the idea that due to a mistake or blunder All Humans must face death and the true everlasting life is reserved solely for the gods so while there was an idea of a underworld and an Overworld it's different to our modern interpretations or interpretations in judeo-christian theologies the afterlife in Mesopotamian belief was characterized by a resigned acceptance of the inevitable fate of mortality there aren't any known Mesopotamian Tales specifically detailing the end of the world or an apocalypse like we have in Revelations and other religions however there is a speculation about their beliefs regarding the eventual end of the world berosus a helenistic era Babylonian writer um that is his Greek Name by the way he would have had his own Babylonian name which is perhaps lost at time he mentioned that the Mesopotamians believed that the world would last last 12 * 12 SARS now given that a sar was considered to be 3,600 years this would suggest that some Mesopotamians believed the Earth had a lifespan of 518,000 400 years which is oddly precise unfortunately this berosus this helenistic a Babylonian writer didn't really provide any information on what was believed to follow this extended period leaving the fate of the world after this duration uncertain in Mesopotamian beliefs and now as for the Reconstruction of this Mesopotamian religion now Mesopotamian religion existing between between approximately 6,000 BCE and around 400 CE was a polytheistic belief system practiced in civilizations such as Sumer accad Assyria and Babylonia two main groups the East Semitic acadians and the samarians initially dominated the region samarians credited with the early advancements like writing m mathematics and city states held influence until the rise of the acadians around 2335 BC the Assyrian political structure started as an oligarchy with religious ties the ruler known as the steward of assur LED alongside an assembly of Elders and an eponym religious beliefs in in the Neo Assyrian Empire centered on the King as a chief servant of the god ashur linking kingship closely with the Divine mandate Mesopotamian religion featured a Pantheon of anthropomorphic deities around 2400 in number early Gods like enlil and Anu gained importance while Marduk Rose to prominence during babylon's ascendency the Epic of Gilgamesh and a Cadian influences are significant aspects and I do advise that you go read the Epic of gilgames perhaps I'll do a reading on it at a later date recent discoveries such as the cultic area at geu shed light on religious practices Mesopotamian temples constructed as ziggurats served as Dwelling Places for gods and rituals maintained the God's well-being the king played a crucial role as a religious leader individuals practiced personal worship and moral virtues emphasized Duty and ritual sin those transgressions were viewed as Rebellion against the god and Punishment often came through sickness or Misfortune the afterlife however was simply portrayed as a land below with no real reward or punishment was actually a equally Bleak place for anyone if you were going to suffer the God would make you suffer immediately while there is no explicit mopan tale about the World's End its belief believe that the Earth's duration was considered limited over 2100 deities were worshiped influencing the subsequent religions worldwide despite the decline of this Mesopotamian religion its influence persists in Judaism Christianity Islam and modern neopagan groups archaeology literary sources and artifacts have all been crucial Parts in reconstructing and understanding this ancient belief system are you still there we've arrived at the end of our talk for today and what an interesting topic to take you back 8,000 years in our history and walk you through the Mesopotamian gods of that old old world and while that world is so mysterious piece by piece we can perhaps put it back together and while we might not be able to fully understand it cannot reach our hands out to those people of the old times we can perhaps get a few hints on what life would have been like and how they went about their day-to-day activities but once again it remains a mystery but like many Mysteries it's extremely fascinating so as we get to the end of our video I'll leave you with some atmosphere to relax and if you've not yet closed your eyes and drifted off to sleep or if you're just relaxing and enjoying your evening morning I will make the Bold assertion that it is indeed evening somewhere in the world so I may wish you good night and sweet dreams hello everyone and welcome back I am the ASMR historian I want to talk to you today about Saron of aard one of the great rulers of the ancient world maybe you've heard of him maybe you have not but in either case I'm going to tell you everything that you need to know and a lot of things that you probably could have done without knowing so without further Ado I hope you found yourself somewhere comfortable I certainly have and we can now begin Saron of accard also known as sagon the great was the anoral ruler of the Acadian Empire during the 24th to the 23rd centuries BC renowned for his conquests of Samarian city states he is often regarded as the first historical figure to govern an Empire Saron founded the saronic or old Acadian Dynasty which persisted for approximately a century until the guian conquest of suur now all these names suar akad I want you to think of it in Modern Day Iran Iraq this sort of area the birth of our first civil izations centered around the tigis and Euphrates rivers according to the Samaran King list sagon served as the cup Bearer to King IR zababa of Kish his Empire is believed to have spanned most of Mesopotamia that is the land between the Tigris and Euphrates River extending into regions of the Levant the Levant being our modern-day Palestine additionally Saron conducted incursions into territories occupied by the hurrians and elamites the capital of his Empire accad has yet to be conclusively identified through archaeological evidence it's still out there waiting to be discovered who knows maybe you'll be the person who discovers it sagon is featured as a legendary figure in Neo Assyrian literature dating from the 8th to 7th centuries BC with fragments of sargon's birth Legend discovered in the library of Asher banipal the Acadian name can be normalized as either saru ukin or saru Ken and its kuna form spelling varies kuna form being the style of writing etched onto clay tablets that the samarians Babylonians and much of the Bronze Age societies had adopted so its conform spelling varieties would include Lugal ukin SAR rugen sariin and sarum keyin in the old Babylonian tablet recounting zon's Legends the name is transcribed as saru so a little bit of differences between the regional dialects and uh it also uh would depend on how they would use the specific cona form written language would be different to spoken language depending on the constraints of the con form that was being used in the late Assyrian references the name is is predominantly spelled as Lugal gin or Lugal gin identical to the name of the Neo Assyrian King sagon II the spelling sagon is derived from its sole mention in the Hebrew Bible specifically in Isaiah 21 in reference to sagon II so of course Saron II is not the sagon we are talking about that was the successor we are talking about the first Sargon however when they referred to Saron II and we look at uh Hebrew sources for it that's the best that we have to go upon much like uh many translations of biblical names old testament names especially Babylonians Samarian Kings and and whatnot have been adopted into our modern language through biblical transliterations the first component of the name saru is the Acadian term for King and that's similar to the Hebrew s the second element is derived from the verb kinon which meant to confirm or establish so it's like saying the confirmed king or the king is confirmed the king is established much like how Egyptian names were thinking of Egyptian names like uh tutank Amun aanon nepati they all meant certain things uh uh aranan from memory meaning the tin is pleased or something along those lines the reading aruin however could potentially been interpreted as the King has established stability or he the God has established the king so once again we have references to the divine right of kings even so early as 4,000 5,000 years ago however such a name would be unconventional as other names in ukin typically involve both a subject and an object as seen in examples like amama umin meaning shamash has established an heir there is ongoing debate about whether the name was an adop Ed regnal name or simply birth name another reading aru Ken has been interpreted adjectively signifying the king is established or legitimate and is expanded as a phrase arum enum now do keep in mind that I obviously do not see speak or do not have the ability to read any of the uh K form or understand much of it so um please take my pronunciation with a very large grain of salt if anybody does have the ability to read Cana form or pronounce it correctly please comment below and while you're listening I will remind you that if you're enjoying these videos I would certainly appreciate if you liked And subscribe to the channel which will give me further motivation apart from my own personal research and interest in doing these videos to uh make some more for the audience that is slowly building and now let's continue the terms pre sargonic and post sargonic were a initially used in assyriology relying on nabonidus Chron chronologies chronologies rather before the historical existence of Saron ofad was confirmed kind of like how we have our modern dating conventions between uh BC and AD so before Christ after death if you are so inclined to use those dating conventions Sargon coming into the world was such a big event such a changing point in society that they had something along those same lines too as what we can understand as AD and BC pre sargonic post sargonic the form aru ukin became known from the Assyrian sagon Legend discovered in 1867 in the library of Ash banipal at nineve a contemporaneous reference to sagon was thought to be found on the cylinder seal of I sharu a high ranking official serving under sagon in 1877 Jim manant described this seal reading the king's name as shagan shl without yet I identifying it as Sargon the Elder who was associated with the old Assyrian King Saron I the British museum acquired the mace head of Shar ganish Shari in 1883 a votive gift deposited at the Temple of shamash in sear initially identified as Shani Shere with sagon this identification was later recognized as mistaken in the 1910s however sorry to ruin your fun British museum sharani Shari is in fact sargon's great grandson and the successor of naram sin that's another main character of uh the old acadians there is some uncertainty regarding whether the Neo Assyrian King Saron II was directly named after Saron of aard as there is Ambu in rendering his name as aruin or aru kin there are a few primary sources directly related to sagon and the most notable near contemporary reference not contemporary but near contemporary comes from the various versions of the Sumerian Kings list this was a list where they wrote down the reain dates of all of the kings of suur to a decently accurate information as accurate as they could get it but going back in time uh relying on accounts based on memory must always be taken with a little bit of skepticism however according to these sources sagon is described as the son of a gardener and the former cupbearer of UR zababa of Kish he seized the kingship from Lugal zag sea of urk that was another city quite powerful one and established his rule in the city of akad the wedner chronicle dated to the early second millennium BC presents Sargon as the immediate successor to IR zababa without mentioning at all Lugal zagi different copies of the Kings list provide varying rain lengths of Sargon ranging from 40 to 54 or 56 years once again we got to take it with a grain of salt when you're going off memory while only a limited number of contemporary inscriptions about sagon exist there are several texts from the old Babylonian period that claim to be copies of earlier inscriptions related to Saron in terms of absolute years zon's Reign is estimated to have occurred around 2334 to 2279 BC according to the middle chronology his successors up until the guian conquest of su are collectively referred to as the sargonic dynasty defining the sargonic period in Mesopotamian history there has been a debate around the duration of sargon's reign as we had just previously mentioned while some interpretations suggest a 55e rule others have argued that this was likely a corruption of an earlier reading that only indicates 37 years an earlier version of the king's list mentions sargon's Reign lasting for 40 years however but the king's list wasn't just one document there were several of them floating around and they were always revised Thor killed Jacobson an archaeologist has expressed expressed uncertainty about the Clause mentioning sargon's father as a Garder and he knows his stuff so we better listen to him and he marks it as a Luna in the historical record and indicating ambiguity about his meaning this is one of these problems with very very old languages words like this can be misinterpreted mistranslated there could also be slang terms there's many different interpretations of that a famous interpretation is that um well let's look at the founding of Rome for example Romulus and Remis being raised by wolves or a wolf um now a lot of people may argue that well at that time in the at truscan cultures uh a wolf would was a nickname for a prostitute so it could have been that they were referring to them being taken into a house or by women of ill repute at the time however uh this does not make it a very Noble founding story so people generally tend to go with the more sanitary and Noble option so back to sagon the the assertion that sagon was the original founder of a card has also faced challenges due to the discovery of an inscription mentioning the place and data to the first year of and I'm going to Booker this en shushana who likely preceded him once again pardon my pronunciation you've got a you've got to bear with me once again from the Widener Chronicle and it suggests that it was sagon who built Babylon in front of aad now this throws a lot of timelines out of whack but let's continue similarly the chronicle of early Kings very early document states that late in his Reign Sargon dug up the soil of the pit of Babylon and made a counterpart of Babylon next to agade some Scholars like Van deup Mark vup Writing very many books on the subject one that I do have on my shelf and I read during university has proposed that these Chronicles may actually refer to the much later Assyrian King Sargon II of the Neo Assyrian Empire rather than Saron of aad two different guys although different versions of the Samaran kings's list and the later Babylonian Chronicles attribute varying rain lengths to Saron ranging from 34 to 56 years the available data documents provide information on only four distinct year names from his actual Reign the years are associated with his military campaigns against Elum Mari simum and Rua in Western Elum so it was much more often in those days if you want to know what year it was you would say oh the year when Saron reigned or the year when Saron was crowned or the year of the Great Famine the great flood whatever great event was the defining part of the year so those four years that were mentioned were as follows the first one the year in which Saron went to simum the year in which Saron destroyed uroa the year in which Sargon destroyed Elum and the year in which Mari was destroyed those are our known regnal year names of Sargon and now let's talk about the conquest of Sumer in the inscription Saron refers to himself as Saron king of aard overseer of inana king of Kish anointed of Anu King of the land of Mesopotamia and governor of enil this inscription commemorates sag's Triumph in the conquest of Uruk to defeat lagu zagi if you want to see this inscription I have a link in the description sagon claims to have successfully captured the city of Uruk demolished its walls and emerged victorious in battle notably he took lagal zazi the king of UR captive during the conflict and paraded him to the gate of enlil wearing a collar woof woof sagon king of aad overseer of inana king of Kish appointed of Anu King of the land governor of enlil defeated the city of urk and tore down its walls in the Battle of UR he won took lagal zazi king of urak in the course of the battle and led him by a color into the gate of enil that is direct quote from the inscription of Saron an old Babylonian tablet from nepur so Sargon wasn't finished with the fun after that has to keep going he then conquered Ur and nmar and laid waste to the territory from lagash to the Sea going on to conquer and Destroy Umar and here's another passage from that same inscription Saron king of agard was Victorious over ER in battle conquered the city and destroyed its wall he conquered enar destroyed its walls and conquered the district as lagash as far as the sea he washed his weapons in the sea and he was Victorious over Umar in battle conquered the city destroyed its walls the lord of the land at the God envil gave no rival the God enlil gave to him the upper Sea and the lower sea seems like he was doing very very well but I know you want more conquests so now Saron faced his attention to Upper Mesopotamia and as far as the Mediterranean Sea submitting himself to the levantin god Dagan Sargon conquered the territories of upper Mesopotamia and the Levant including Mari yuti and IO up to the cedar forest and up to the Sila Mountain ruling from the upper sea to the lower sea now the upper sea is is referring to the Mediterranean the lower sea is referring to the Persian Gulf and so now to the conquest of Elum and marashi sagon also claims in his inscriptions that he is Saron King of the World Conqueror of Elum and param the two major polies of the east of Samaria he also names various rulers of the East whom he vanquished such as Lan son of huishi King of Elum or sidal general of parum who later also appears in an inscription by rush sagon triumphed over 34 cities in total ships from malua Magan and dilmun rode at anchor in his capital of bakad he entertained a court of standing army of 5,400 men whom he apparently ate bread with every day it's good to see him getting along with the boys a set of four Babylonian texts commonly referred to as sagon epos portrays Sargon as a military leader seeking counsel from various advisors before embarking on campaigns The Narrative of the text unfolds at sargon's court during a time of crisis in this context Sargon addresses his Warriors extoling the virtues of heroism the story also includes a lecture by a courtier praising the glory achieved by a champion of the army a narrative detailing sargon's campaign into the distant land of utar rashim which involves an account of the darkening of the sun and the conquest of the land of simum perhaps it was a solar eclipse the king of battle narrative another source recounts sargon's Expedition against the Anatolian city of poranda undertaken to safeguard his Merchants as they were under attack this story exists in versions written in both hittite and Acadian the Hittites were a group in modern-day turkey the hitti version survives in six fragments while the Acadian version is preserved in manuscripts found at Amman Asura and nineve notably The Narrative is anachronistic displaying Sargon in a 19th century setting in this account zaragon is mentioned to have crossed the Sea of the West which is a reference to the Mediterranean Sea and arrived at Kara a term that some Scholars have interpreted as the Acadian design Nation for keu an ancient region often associated with creit or Cyprus famine and War threatened sargon's Empire during the later years of his Reign the chronicle of early Kings reports that revolts broke out throughout the area under the last years of his lordship afterwards in sargon's old age all the lands revolted against him and they besieged him in a card and Sargon went onward to battle and actually defeated them he accomplished their overthrow and their widespread hosting he destroyed afterwards he attacked the land of Subaru in his might and they submitted to his arms and Saron settled that Revolt defeating them he accomplished their overthrow and their wides spreading host he destroyed and he brought their possessions back to aard the soil From The Trenches of Babylon he removed and the boundaries of aard he made like those of Babylon but because of the evil which he had committed the great Lord Marduk was angry and he destroyed his people by famine from the Rising Sun unto the Setting Sun they opposed him and gave him no rest and that was a reading from a old Samarian tablet and now we move on to the chronicle of early Kings shortly after securing Sumer Saron embarked on a series of campaigns to subjugate the entire Fertile Crescent according to the chronicle of early Kings a later Babylonian historiographical text and I will now read from that sagon had neither rival nor equal his Splendor over the lands it diffused he crossed the sea in the east in the 11th year he he conquered the western land to its farthest point he bought it under one Authority he set up his statues there and fed the West's booty across on bares he stationed his court officials at intervals of five double hours and ruled in unity the tribes of the lands he marched on to kazal and turned kazal into a ruined Heap so that there was not even a perch for a bird left and now let's talk about some origin Legends of sagon a figure like this certainly would have a very interesting origin story one that is most likely very made up but let's have a look at the Legends anyway CU it's always a bit of fun sagon story evolved into legendary narratives detailing his Ascent from humble beginnings and his conquest of Mesopotamia in later Assyrian and Babylonian literature in addition to these secondary and partly legendary accounts there are numerous inscriptions attributed to sagon himself however the majority of these inscriptions are known only from much later copies the Lu houses fragments of of two saronic Victory stells recovered from Susa with the presumption that they were transported from Mesopotamia in the 12th century BC the Samarian language sagon Legend contains a legendary account of sargon's rise to power it is an older version of the previously known Assyrian Legend discovered in 197 4 in nepur and first edited in 1983 subsequent scholarship questioned if the two fragments were actually a join or were even from two entirely different texts the initial translation has also been questioned the existing versions of the sagon legend are incomplete but the two surviving fragments mentioned sagon father as La ium after a gap in the text it resumes With Ur zababa the king of Kish Awakening after an undisclosed dream for reasons not provided in the preserved portion of the tablet zababa appoints Saron as his cup Bearer subsequently zababa summons Saron to discuss a dream of sargon's involving the goddess in Nan favoring him and the drowning of zababa by the goddess in river of blood deeply alarmed zababa order sagon assassination the one to do the dirty deed was the chief Smith by the name of belly tial however inana intervenes instructing Saron to stop at the gates due to his being polluted with blood when sagon returns to uraba the king becomes frightened once again and decides to send Saron to King Lugal zagi of Uruk with a message on a clay tablet asking him to kill Saron the legend concludes at this point and the missing sections likely narrate how Saron ascended to the king ship and now for his birth Legends let's have a look at that the Neo Assyrian text from the 7th Century BC reporting to be sargon's autobiography asserts that the great king was the illegitimate son of a priestess only the the beginning of the texts the first two columns that is are known from fragments of three manuscripts the first fragments were discovered as early as 1850 in that golden age of archaeology sargon's birth and his early childhood are discussed thus and I quote my mother was a high priestess my father I know not the brothers of my father love the hills and the mountains my city is Azu panu which is situated on the banks of the Euphrates my high priestess mother conceived me in secret she bore me she set me in a basket of rushes with bitchman she sealed my lid she cast me into the river which arose over me the river bore me up and carried me to Aki the drawer of water Aki the drawer of water took me as his son and raised me Aki the drawer of water appointed me as his Gardener while I was a gardener Ishtar granted me her love and for four years I exercised kinship now it cuts out a little bit there four and a certain amount of years unfortunately we don't know the exact amount similarities between the sagon birth Legend and other infant birth exposures in ancient literature including Moses Cara Oedipus were of course noted by psychoanalyst Otto rank in his 1909 book The Myth of the birth of the hero the legend was also studied in detail by Brian Lewis and compared with many different examples of the infant birth exposure motive found in Eurasian faot Tales he discusses a possible archetype form giving particular attention to the SAG on Legend and the account of the birth of Moses Joseph Campbell has also made such comparisons sagon is one of the many suggestions for the Identity or inspiration for the biblical Nimrod Ying William suggested that Sargon based on his unification of the Babylonians and the Neo Assyrian birth Legend and for sag's family Sagan's main wife was named Queen Tash lulum and the names of several of his children are known notably his daughters and huana served as a high priestess of the Moon God in Ur and compos ritual hymns including the famous hymn exaltation of inana which remained in use for centuries zagon was succeeded by his son Rush followed by another son Manish tushu who later passed the throne to his own son naram sin additional Sons named shu enlil and ilaba is takal are also recorded while sagon is sometimes identified as the first historical figure to rule over an Empire earlier Sumerian rulers like luga zagi could also make similar claims sargon's Reign marks the beginning of the citic empires in the ancient near East lasting for nearly the 15th centuries until the ayate conquest after the 539 Battle of Opus Saron continued to be revered as a model by Mesopotamian Kings for approximately 2,000 years after his death Assyrian and Babylonian rulers who established their empires in Mesopotamia viewed themselves as success accessors to sag's Legacy sagon may have played a role in introducing the concept of an Empire as later understood during the Neo Assyrian period the Neo Assyrian sagon text written in the first person features sagon challenging subsequent rulers to govern the indigenous population of Mesopotamia as he did oral traditions in in the later Bronze Age as evidenced by a middle hittite record from the 15th century BC depicts sagon and his immediate successors as deified kings emphasizing their heroic status zon's name was carried by two later Mesopotamian Kings sagon I first a king of the old Assyrian period likely adopted his name in homage to Saron ofad Saron II as we've mentioned a few times a Neo Assyrian King also took his name from sagon of aard and it is this king who was referred to as sagon in the Hebrew Bible in Isaiah 21 the Neo Babylonian King nebon demonstrated a keen interest in the history of the Sargon Dynasty and even he went as far to conduct excavations of sargon's palaces and those of his successors emphasizing the enduring historical significance of the sanid lineage and this is where we end for today now if that Neo Babylonian King nabonidus can conduct excavations and find interesting things that would perhaps teach us something and maybe one day we will be able to find that lost city of a card oh and I hope that when we do it'll be filled with all sorts of Juicy clay tablets for us to F over and translate over the next few decades you'll be surprised how many of those clay tablets are stuck in some basement of a museum somewhere in the middle of nowhere in some Warehouse although I will be fair most of them are simply just trade receipts especially the very early ones but if you find that sort of stuff interesting maybe you can visit the British museum or the Lou where all of those artifacts are H perhaps they should or should not be there but at least we know they're safe for the time being and that's all I have to say for this topic I hope you've enjoyed it a little bit of a strange topic to talk about very old very ancient but always worthwhile to learn I am the ASMR historian and I hope you've enjoyed being with me tonight I'm going to leave the fireplace sounds on so you can go and have a nice dream and so with that I will say good night and sweet dreams hello and welcome back I'm the ASMR historian and today we're going to talk about the ancient city of Babylon from the early Beginnings all the way up to its preservation in modern times so find somewhere comfortable because it's going to be a long video Babylon situated on the lower Euphrates river in modern day Iraq played a pivotal role in ancient Mesopotamia it served as the cultural and political heart of Babylonia witnessing the rise and fall of significant Empires the city's prominence began as a Rel religious and Cultural Center during the aradian Empire following the aradian Empire's collapse Babylon thrived under the old Babylonian Empire established by hamurabi in the 19th century BC hamurabi elevated Babylon into a major city and it became the capital of Babylonia surpassing another great City nepur in significance the Empire's influence waned Over time however facing Domination by Assyrians cites and elamites Babylon saw a Revival under the Neo Babylonian Empire from 609 to roughly 539 BC during which the Hanging Gardens one of the Seven Ancient Wonders of the World world became renowned subsequently the city changed hands under the rule of the ayid salid parean Roman sassanid and later on Muslim empires at its Zenith Babylon was likely the world's largest city around 1770 to 1670 BC and later during its Revival from 612 to 320 BC potentially boasting a population exceeding 200,000 huge for that time the city's remains now in hila Iraq provide insight into its Grandeur though deciphering its complete history remains challenging due to incomplete and sometimes conflicting sources you recognized Babylon as a world heritage site in 2019 it draws numerous visitors primarily local Iraqis however rapid construction and modernization of Iraq threatens the preservation of these ancient ruins but what is the name Babylon where does this come from and what does it really mean mean well the name Babylon Finds Its origin in the Latin representation of the Greek Babylon derived from the Native Babylonian term babym and that word babym meant the Gate of the Gods so the name of Babylon meant the Gate of the Gods the kuna form spelling was the writing that they used in Babylon given to them by the acadians was K digir raki and it corresponds to the Samarian phrase kak which is what they referred to when they were speaking of Babylon it involves the logogram for car which meant gate and dear for God and raah representing the coder of the word dear followed by the genitive suffix AK the final key functions as a determinative indicating a place name so it was essentially a literal translation from the word babym in Babylonian uh to um Acadian and Samarian writings initially the setic name was considered a lone translation of the original Sumerian name but the Gate of God interpretation is now viewed as a citic folk atmology to explain unknown original non-semitic place name the original name was proposed to be babila transforming into Acadian babym the Samarian name kandak was seen as a latter lone translation of the catic folk atmology the earliest mention of the city might be from early dynastic period inscription referring to an unknown Lord as the governor NC it was what they called their Governors and this governor's name was barar possibly that indicates Babylonian Roots name's original form could mean shining or glowing or white the Samarian phonetic spelling Baum and the cite period spellings pumalo and Babalu provide insight into its evolving forms so as language was always changing so was the way that we were referring to Babylon in different texts through different periods and different regions alternate spellings for Babylon include tin and E attested in various periods in the Hebrew Bible it appears as Babel interpreted to mean confusion the name is also found in Pali and Sanskrit literature it's all the way in India and it's called bavu in their tongue ancient records sometimes use Babylon for other cities within its influence like Boral and even nineve for a brief period after the Assyrian sack of Babylon now Babylon was situated along the Euphrates River it featured steep embankments to manage seasonal floods as well present day hilah babil government in uh govern it rather in Iraq preserves remnant of the ancient City and it's about 85 kilm south of Baghdad the S spans approximately 2 km by 1 km with Mounds aligned north to south along the river key features of this site include the palace or the castle the central location housing the Neo Babylonian zigurat amran ibin Ali the highest mound to the South which reaches 25 M it was the site of esagila a Temple dedicated to Marduk a and Nabu those were just three of the Gods in the pantheon Homa a reddish Mound on the west side hold holding the most helenistic remains that means Greek all the Greek stuff was over there we'll get to uh the Greek period of of uh of time in Babylonia later and finally the fourth of the key features is babil a 22 M Mound at the Northern end and that featured a palace constructed by none other than nebuch Nezar he was one of the ones from the Old Testament if you're familiar with Old Testament uh theology then I'm sure you recognize the name excavations have exposed only a small portion of the city with artifacts mainly from the Neo Babylonian era Rising water tables and rebuilding projects by later occupants have obscured a lot of the earlier records Babylon faced pillaging by various powers and that includes the Hittites the elamites and the Neo Assyrian Empire and don't forget the ayid Empire much of the western part of the city is submerged and some areas were mined for building materials the the cold away Expedition however recovered many artifacts and useful ones at that including 967 clay tablets from the old Babylonian period providing insights into Samarian literature and language now a quick word on these Babylonian tablets Samarian tablets a Cadian tablets it's very rare that you are going to pull a can formed tablet out of the ground and find some beautiful poem or some description of some normal person's daily life or some epic story very rare what you would most likely find would be trade receipts you know 50 goats or however many bolts of wool or copper or iron whatever it was that they were buying especially if we're talking about earlier period weird can form tablets as that was essentially their only use it was only until much later that they figured out that we could write other things within an expand K form script but I digress nearby settlements like Kish bipa dbat Kusa marad and SAR contribute to the historical context of the region of course we can't talk about Babylon as just the one city as the capital but we can't forget that the Babylonians controlled a very large portion of modern day Iraq and uh much of the Fertile Crescent at some point stretching all the way from the uh the North to the south of the region and from both the tigis and Euphrates rivers so there are other cities that we can use to gain more insight on the Babylonians in general so how do we understand these various sources well there are several main ways that we can piece together the history of Babylon the first being excavation of the actual site now due to a lot of restrictions from local governments and modern conflicts all this sorts of thing where somewhat Limited in the excavation that we can do um we also don't want to destroy anything that is left for us in our search for artifacts but the insights that we have gotten from The Limited excavations we have have been very useful much of these insights of course has come from cadaa form texts many of them as I mentioned found from other Mesopotamian locations as as well other large cities as Uruk the aformentioned nepur sarari Harum contribute to a lot of the historical knowledge that we have on this another thing is classical writing if we want to piece together a story about Babylon we can always ask the classical authors at the time many of whom would come from Greece and travel and write down their observation so we have things from Herodotus which many people don't take as gospel but we'll get to that later tesus quintus cus Rufus drabo clarus you many of them described or possibly even visited Babylon depending on the interpretation of the texts now a lot of them may vary in accuracy and because they are not Babylonians must remember that they are probably somewhat politically biased depending on the time in which they were writing um but nonetheless they offer valuable information and finally we have biblical references to Old Testament and which is littered with mentions of Babylon uh which provide an additional perspective into the city's history once again grains of consult with Biblical references but the Old Testament generally is more of a cultural reading so if we do take that as not too serious then we can gain a little bit of a better picture on Babylon so these diverse sources despite presenting challenges due to potential inaccuracies biases as I've mentioned um really help us to get some sort of a clue of what's going on much of which we look at at the peak of Babylonian civilization the Neo Babylonian Empire around the 6th Century BC when we mentioned before that uh the city was at its height of population once again around an estimated 200,000 which would have been larger than other large cities in the world at the time like Alexandria Egypt so so let's think now about some early references to Babylon I'm talking very very early at the time of sagon of aad the Acadian Empire that i' mentioned in my video several days ago that you may want to go and listen to uh so let's talk about the Acadian Empire time the first mention that we have of Babylon as a small town as all big cities start off as comes from a clay tablet during the reign of sh khish Shari who reigned from 2217 to around 2193 BC and that was a king of the Acadian Empire that same one that sagon of aard had so greatly expanded Acadian and Samarian literature from the late 3D millennium BC also read references the city so we're talking 4,000 years ago it was still around 4,000 years if you don't think that that's completely amazing then go and watch another video okay so let's go and look at the foundations by sarisari there is a tablet describing the Acadian King King is laying foundations for new temples in Babylon so this King we just mentioned he was at least taking credit for laying these temples and building up this new small town that would become a great City administrative records of the third dynasty of UR another very powerful City at the same SES as nepur and Uruk mention Babylon in tax collection and the appoint appointment of a local Governor so we have systems of tax collections going on administered by a complex form of government which is indeed if not a civilization the very egg in which a civilization hatches from now concerning some classical dating of babylon's foundation tesas cited by diodorus sicilus and calus claimed that access to Babylonian archives dating to the city's founding in 2286 BC under the reign of its first king Bello so they had access to all the old clean tablets and old for 2286 BC so they were having history before history was even a thing berosus as mentioned by plen stated that the astronomical observations in Babylon began 490 years before the Greek era of fenus and that indicates a year of around 2243 BC stefanus of Byzantium wrote that Babylon was built 1,2 years before the siege of Troy now if we look at the date of the siege of Troy which escapes me at the moment it dates its foundation to around 2231 BC so these classical accounts placed babylon's foundation in the 23rd Century BC however no corresponding caniform records have been found to validate these post Cana form dating claims the Amorite rule in Babylon is documented to have begun around the 19th or 18th century BC with sumu abum who declared independent from the neighboring city state of kazal sumu el possibly a contemporary of suu abum is often considered the founder of the first Babylonian Dynasty both rulers are credited with constructing babylon's walls and Samu Lael expanded babylon's influence through military successes initially a minor City State babylon's first four Amorite rulers did not assume the title of King however under hamurabi rule that being from 1792 to 1750 BC Babylon Rose to even greater prominence hamurabi known for codifying the laws into the famous code of hamurabi conquered various cities and city states in southern Mesopotamia unifying them into a single Kingdom this included isin Larsa Ur Uruk nepur lagash IDU Kish adab Asuna asak and many more all notable cities and great trade cities hamurabi also expanded his Empire by invading ilam to the East and the territories to the Northwest after hamurabi Reign Babylonia became the term for the entirety of southern Mesopotamia the Sealand dasty emerged in the far south elamites seized Eastern territories and the cites took control of Babylon in 1595 renaming it konash a great break from tradition the cite Dynasty endured for 435 years until 1160 BC Babylon weakened during the cite era paid tribute to the Egyptian pharaoh tmas III the cide period saw Babylon becoming subject to the middle Assyrian Empire to the north and ilum to the east by 1155 BC Assyrian and ilite attacks led to the downfall of the cite allowing an Acadian South Mesopotamian Dynasty to finally take rule despite the change Babylon remained vulnerable facing Domination by Assyria in the 11th century BC the arameans and suan from the Levant and later the Chans in the 9th century BC entered and appropriated areas of of Babylonia further challenging babylon's stability the arameans briefly governed Babylon until the late 11th century BC during the Neo Assyrian Empire Babylonia experienced constant Assyrian dominance or Direct Control the reign of sarib Saw repeated Babylonian revolts led by by chieftain merodac baladan in Alliance with the elamites to suppress these revolts sinur destroyed Babylon in 689 BC raising its walls temples and its palaces the religious Center's destruction shocked many and sarb's Murder by his own sons while he was praying was seen as atonement his successor Asar hadon quickly rebuilt Babylon making it his residence after assar haddon's death his son shamash shumin initiated a civil war against his brother Asher banipal the ruler of nineve Babylon was then bes eged and Asher banipal appointed as an Assyrian Governor to rule the city this governor's name was named calano under the new ruler naop piser Babylon gained independence from Assyria and the M Babylonian forces between 626 BC and 609 BC ultimately toppled the Assyrian Empire Babylon became the capital of the Neo Babylonian or as it is also called the Chalan Empire the era of architectural activity blossomed especially during Nebuchadnezzar II's Reign Nebuchadnezzar ordered extensive reconstruction including the etani zigurat and the ishar gate the Hanging Gardens of Babylon were also accredited to Nebuchadnezzar however they're somewhat debated among historians with conflicting opinions on their locations and some even saying that they never really existed or were greatly blown out of proportion Nebuchadnezzar is also so linked to the Babylonian exile of the Jews employing a strategy of mass deportation to Babylon as a method of pacification he is also asso with Associated rather with the destruction of Solomon's Temple and the Babylonian Chronicles record the defeat of the Jews the Hebrew Bible recounts the Babylonian exile as a significant event in Jewish history and if you're still watching I'd like to remind you that if you are enjoying the content you may consider liking and subscribing to the channel so that in the future you may enjoy more and so that I can feel a little bit better about myself of course no pressure in any case just enjoy the video in 539 BC the Neo Babylonian Empire succumbed to Cyrus the Great of Persia marked by the Battle of Opus babylon's formidable walls seemed impregnable and if you've seen the pictures they certainly look rather intimidating and the entry inside was only possible directly through the gates or the Euphrates River the river's flow through the city was controlled by underwater metal grates very Advanced system for the time cus devised a cunning plan during a Babylonian National Feast his troops diverted the Euphrates Upstream lowering the water level that's why they called him Cyrus the Great seizing the opportunities Persians soldiers entered the city covertly conquering its outskirts While most Babylonians in the city center were completely unaware of what was happening now this account is detailed by one Herodotus but it's also found in parts of the Hebrew Bible Herodotus described Babylon as having a moat a Col wall made of bitchman buildings on top and aund Gates he mentioned Babylonians wearing turbans using perfume burying their dead in Honey practicing ritual prostitution and noted that some tribes exclusively ate fish the term for this is pescatarian Pesca being the Greek word word or the Latin word I believe for fish pescatarian uh usually in our modern day if we have a vegetarian person who says well I eat fish they're not a vegetarian they're a pescatarian so keep that in mind though initially considered Greek folklore right 100 gate certainly seems quite a lot recent SK have actually urged a reconsider a reconsideration rather of herod's account and they proposed that it may actually contain some authentic information now if we are even considering this then we can certainly say that this was a very very large city according to two Chronicles or rather according to Chronicles 236 in the Hebrew Bible Cyrus after conquering Babylon in 539 BC issued a decree allowing captive peoples including the Jews to return to their homelands the Cyrus cylinder is often considered corroborative evidence of this policy though it's interpretation is disputed due to its amission of specific mention of Jews Jerusalem or Judea under Cyrus and the subsequent Persian king duras I Babylon became the city of the 9th satrapy encompassing Babylonia in the South and athera in the north it also became a center of learning and scientific advancement in the aimed Persia Babylonian art such as astronomy mathematics experience a Revival with Babylonian Scholars producing maps of constellations very Advanced at the time I will say um Persian mathematics and astronomy was extremely Advanced the word that we have in the Hebrew Bible for uh the three wise men that came to visit Jesus in the story of his birth the word actually used were Magi now the Magi were astrologers uh astronomers rather not astrologers astronomers and they were seen as experts and very smart at the time so much that they were considered magical it had to be some kind of out of this world sort of science that they were understanding it couldn't be real far too complicated for a normal person to understand so they were referred to as Magi and this is where we get our modern day word for magic isn't that just lovely so the city served as the administrative capital of the Persian Empire for over two centuries now in terms of religious efforts uh the early efforts of Persian kings to maintain the religious ceremonies of Marduk babylon's main god over Taxation and the strain of multiple Wars unfortunately led to a decline in the city's main shrines and canals the region became destabilized leading to various rebellions as it always does in 522 BC Nebuchadnezzar II and 521 BC Nebuchadnezzar I 4th and 4 82 BC and you going have to bear with me with this one bimani Al shash Sherba native Babylonian Kings briefly regained independence however these uprisings were swiftly suppressed and rather cruy and Babylon remained under Persian Ru until two centuries until one day of very big guy with definite main character Vibes came along to stop the party can you guess who it is in 331 BC it's Alexander the Great and nobody was telling him what to do so in October 3 uh 331 BC Alexander the Great defeated deas II at the Battle of GAA marking the end of the ayid Persian Empire under Alexander's rule Babylon once again became a flourishing center of learning and commers however after Alexander's death in 323 BC his empire was divided among his generals into successor kingdoms and that led to Decades of power struggles and warfare not what he had in mind it's like seeing your children fight over the will after you've died or when you're on the deathbed unfortunately a story all too common in the modern day the constant turmoil of all of this resulted in the depletion of babylon's population many people just got sick of the nonsense and thought let's just move we don't want to be a part of this anymore and they did they left and poor old Babylon went back down to being a smaller City if it could be called a city At All by 275 BC a tablet recorded the babylon's inhabitants were transported to saloia where a palace and a temple were built babylon's significance as a city diminished but sacrifices continued to be performed in its old Sanctuary more than a century later during the paean and assassinate Empires Babylon along with Assyria became a province under Persian rule for nine centuries until around a. 650 trun briefly captured Babylon in ad. 1116 as part of the conquered province of Mesopotamia but his successor hadrien relinquished these Eastern territories thanks Adrien despite all of the foreign conquests Babylon maintained its distinct culture and people speaking very various Aramaic dialects and preserving its identity the Babylonian talmud the Gnostic mandian religion Eastern right Christianity and the teachings of the philosopher Manny are just some of the examples of this cultural continuity Christianity arrived in Mesopotamia in the first and 2nd centuries ad as it was spreading out and Babylon served as the seat of a bishop of the Church of the East well into the Arab and Islamic conquest era coins from the parean cenan and Arabic periods found in Babylon attest to the ongoing settlement and we can always tell what years those are from by the kings that are on there matching them up with their Reigns in the mid 7th Century Mesopotamia underwent islamization as the expanding Muslim Empire conquered and settled in the region Babylon dissolved as a province and Aramaic and the Church of the East Christianity faced marginalization and sometimes outright persecutions medieval Arabic writings described Babylon as a small village no in the visits of Christians and Jews to places like the dungeon of Daniel and the grave Shrine of amran ibin Ali during this period Babylon became a source for bricks extracted for construction across the region from Baghdad to Basra those new cities were just much more popular and much more important Europe Travelers often unable to accurately locate Babylon sometimes mistook fua for the ancient city in the 17th century Petro de laal visited the village of Beil in Babylon observing baked and dried mud bricks cemented with bitan the 18th century saw an increasing flow of travelers to Babylon including ksten Yul and Pierre Joseph deam as well as measurements of its latitude this helped a lot because as we said people were always getting lost on their way to Babylon and it's not the kind of place that you want to get lost and I don't like getting lost by 1905 there were several villagers in Babylon on but before then Bam's Memoir was published in English translation in 1792 and it provoked the British East India Company to direct its agents in Baghdad and Basra to acquire Mesopotamian relics for shipment in London H and if you know anything about the British museum you'll know that if they gave back all of the things they took from other countries they'd be left with the Sutton who helmet in a very small small collection of their own things however if we do want to play Devil's Advocate with the British museum we will say that they are very safely housed in these places away from any modern Wars or any modern psychopathy that may take them away but we hope that one day when situation calms down that all of these relics will be returned to their home countries and we can all have our own nice little museums that tell the stories of our own people so the several villages in Babylon by 1905 were going quite well people were coming back it was a nice little escape to the country a little tree change one of those Villages was one named clesh sorry for my Arabic pronunciation it's obviously is as good as my Babylonian pronunciation and that had about 200 households and it was actually located within the boundaries of the ancient city walls so they were living within the walls of the 4,000 year old city amazing The Village grew though due to the need for Laborers during the German Oriental society excavations and that was going from 1899 to 1917 of course the Germans wouldn't be digging in the dirt themselves they wouldn't be picking a pigx wouldn't you was just the university boys wanting to do the writing and the book work and taking the credit no real muscle on them now as for that excavation and research let's talk a little more about it and let's talk about certain man called Claudius rich now Claudius Rich was working for the British East India Company in Baghdad had excavated Babylon in 1811 and 1812 and then once again in 1817 Captain Ro Robert mnan explored the site briefly in 1827 and 1829 and he even completed a map of Babylon which includes the location of several Villages within it William Loftus visited there in 1849 Austin Henry leard made some soundings during a brief visit in 1850 before abandoning the site so we've had plenty of people going there for various different reasons you must remember that during this time the black market for Antiquities was going very well and much of these clay tablets and all the rest would have most likely been brought back to places like Cairo Alexandria in these port cities perhaps even brought back to Greece and sold off at a good price as a souvenir I'm sure there's many people around that still have them especially the French they were very into it the first systematic archaeological excavations of Babylon were led by Robert CU and his team from the German Oriental society and they spanned from 1899 to 1917 facing challenges like ongoing brick Mining and the imminent threat of British troops in 1917 you must remember that the first world war was going on then CU focused on the Temple of Marduk the processional way and the city wall artifacts including the Ishtar gate fragments and recovered tablets were sent to Germany where Walter Andre reconstructed them for the VES shouts Museum in Berlin let me try the German again just for humor sake VES and beg you pardon but you can't expect me to pronounce these very long German words we'll just call it the Berlin Museum and everybody's happy additional work by the German archaeological Institute in 1956 and 1962 focused on the helenistic theater and the Temple of zigurat respectively subsequent surveys and reviews from 74 to 77 addressed stat graphical concerns and ancient water levels further investigations in 87 and 89 concentrated on the ishara and Nera temples the Iraqi State Organization for Antiquities and Heritage conducted extensive research during restoration efforts yet limited publications of these findings exist how unfortunate and many tablets from Modern excavations remained unpublished now just a note on that you must remember that reading kuna form and translating kuna form is rather a new thing and I'm sure you've seen some of the pictures it is not an easy task it's not just something you can put into Google translate so there are tons and tons of tablets perhaps even the weight of tons I'm sure locked away in some little basement somewhere or several little basements split up between the British Museum and the Lou and in Iraq itself that are just waiting to be translated who knows what we'll find in there even though most of them will just be receipts for buying cattle and Grain and all the rest so since the establishment of the modern Iraqi state in 1921 the site of Babylon has held its significant cultural importance under various Iraqi governments including the Bist regime led by Saddam Hussein efforts were made to protect excavate and restore the ancient city Babylonian images were featured on postcards and stamps and in the 1960s replicas of the ishar gate and the nimac Temple were constructed on site in 1978 Saddam Hussein initiated the archaeological restoration of Babylon project aiming for the Reconstruction key features such as the southern Palace of Nebuchadnezzar the processional way the lion of Babylon and the helenistic era Amphitheater Hussein even minted coins showcasing Babylonian icons what a nice guy annual Babylonian International festivals were held from 1987 to 2002 of course the one in 2003 was unfortunately interrupted Saddam Hussein seeking to associate himself with babylon's Glory inscribed his names on the bricks and placed a portrait of himself alongside Nebuchadnezzar at the entrance of the ruins he removed that AFF forementioned Village of ques in the80s and constructed Sadam Hill a modern place in the zigurat style Palace rather plans for a cable car line over Babylon were halted by the 2003 invasion of Iraq and a cable car going over the entire city of Babylon I really wish we had that you can take up your issues with the American American government as to why we do not have this very fun tourist attraction now following the 2003 invasion of Iraq US troops later replaced by polish forces took control of the Babylon area however their presence led to severe criticism for building the military Camp Alpha on the ancient Babylonian ruins and while the Americans did this they caused irreparable damage to the archaeological site General James T Conway's forces were accused of leveling parts of the site including the famous Ishtar gate so they could build their little military base it's no wonder the locals were somewhat annoyed with this situation the British Museum's near East Department reported significant destruction with 2600 year old brick Pavements crushed archaeological fragments scattered and trenches dug into ancient deposits the head of the Iraqi state board for Heritage and Antiquities criticize the terrible damage caused by polish troops in 2005 the site was handed over to the Iraqi Ministry of culture after a resolution by Poland in 2004 to place the city under Iraqi control well thank you for giving them their City back in April 2006 Colonel John Coleman offered an apology for the damage but claimed the US presence had prevented even greater harm by deterring looters maybe efforts to restore Babylon into a cultural center were discussed but two museums and the library containing replicas of artifacts and local Maps were raided and destroyed during this period what what a shame as of May 2009 the side of Babylon was reopen to tourists by the provincial government of Babel attracting 35,000 visitors in 2017 Babylon was also inscribed as a UNESCO world heritage site on July 5th 2019 the ancient City's outer walls now accommodate modern commun I ities including Zer West sunar Village quesh back from the grave and Al jimjar despite legal restrictions on construction these areas are rapidly expanding from compact settlements to a sprawling Suburbia thousands of residents practicing both Shia and Sunni Islam live within the ancient outer city walls relying on daily wage labor government jobs in Al Hilla and limited agriculture for sustenance modern infrastructure including an oil pipeline also runs through the city walls the State Board of Antiquities and Heritage along with the Antiquity and Heritage police is responsible for site conservation and they're aided by the world monuments fund who do quite good work the provincial inspectorate headquarters is located within the city in a walles as well housing the staff members of these groups and their families in subsidize housing so they may keep a greater watch on what's going on and that brings us all the way from 4,000 years ago to our current day now now if you are not asleep by this time then perhaps you could subscribe to the channel give me that little hit of dopamine you know that little sprinkle of oregano on top of the spaghetti of my life okay A little extra nice thing I hope you've enjoyed the video as much as I enjoy doing the resarch a great topic to talk about if you want more then I'll see you next time but until then you know I have to say it good night and sweet dreams hello everyone welcome to the video I hope hope you're comfortable if not please get yourself into a nice comfortable position and we can begin for today if you're looking for a way to relax and learn something then you are in the right place today we're going to discuss Sumerian religion it's a religion that's been long long forgotten along with much of the Samaran culture but the EOS of it still endure to our modern day so allow me to talk about it extensively today and we can learn something together so let us begin Samarian religion practiced by the people of sumur the first literate civilization in ancient Mesopotamia was characterized by a deep connection between divinities and the natural social orders before the Advent of kingship in Sumer Theocratic priests and religious officials effectively governed the smaller city states though Kings eventually took over priests retained significant influence in Samarian Society initially Samarian Temple were modest one room structures sometimes elevated on platforms as Samaran civilization progressed however these temples evolved into what we know as ziggurats tall pyramid shaped structures that featured sanctuaries at their Summits several of these structures still remain in Modern Day Iran and Iraq definitely worth a look samarians believed in a cosmogeny involving Cosmic births by gods the prime eval Waters namu gave birth to key or Earth and an the sky key and an in turn produced enlil who separated Heaven from Earth and claimed dominion over the Earth humans were thought to be created by Ani or eni the son of an and key so remember that eni can also have the name Anki so don't get confused heaven was reserved exclusively for deities in Samarian belief upon death regardless of their conduct in life all Mortal Spirits were thought to descend from ker to ker a cold dark Cavern deep beneath the Earth ruled by the goddess Ares kagal in ker the only sustenance available was dry dust in later times ereshkigal was believed to rule alongside her husband nural the god of death key deities in the Samaran Pantheon included an the god of the heavens enlil god of wind and storm eni god of water and human culture ninag goddess of fertility in the earth utu God of the Sun and Justice and Nana the god of the moon in the Acadian Empire inana the goddess of sex Beauty and warfare gained widespread veneration across suur featuring prominently in myths like her descent into the underworld Sumerian religious beliefs left a lasting impact on later Mesopotamian cultures influencing the mythologies and religions of the hurrians acadians Babylonians Assyrians and other Middle Eastern groups comparative mythology Scholars have identified parallels between the ancient Sumerian stories and those found in the early sections of the Hebrew Bible quite a coincidence now let's understand some of the primary deities in Greater detail there are way too many to mention at the moment all of the deities of the Samaran Pantheon so let's get the four primary deities out of the way some of which we've already briefly mentioned along with what is known as the three Sky Gods then we will get to some more specifics of how Sumerian religion played out dayto day so we will begin first to talk about the deity Anu Anu originating from the Samarian deity an was the Divine embodiment of the sky reigning as the king of Gods and serving as the ancestor to many ancient Mesopotamian deities associated with both Divine and human kingship Anu often occupied a passive role and was not frequently worshiped some suggest that the aana temple in urak another Samarian city that was quite large at the time was initially dedicated to Anu rather than inan however the evidence for a change in the primary deity is lacking what a shame that the Divine embodiment of the sky did not get the credit that was deserved how s anu's spouse varied across Traditions with key urash and Anu at times equated with each other and all representing the Earth mirroring anu's association with heaven in an alternative tradition the goddess namu was considered anu's wife Anu is mentioned in the Epic of Gilgamesh where his daughter Ishtar convinces him to release the bull of Heaven to attack Gilgamesh resulting in the Bull's death and ishtar's humiliation another myth features Anu summoning the Mortal hero adapa for breaking the wing of the south wind offering him the food and water of immortality both of which gifts adapa declines in other myths such as huran myths particularly in the hiti translations about Kumari Anu was a former ruler of the Gods overthrown by Kamari this event involves the castration and the birth of the weather God tesb possibly inspiring The Narrative of oranos castration in H's the ogyny During the helenistic period helenistic means Greek if you don't know the Greeks call their own country helas anu's potential identification with Zeus has been suggested though this remains uncertain although we can certainly draw many parallels with the Greek pantheon and the Mesopotamian Pantheon that of the Old Testament you will find that much of this Rhymes and early human history tends to give quite a clue to where we got the ideas from Anu meaning sky in Samaran was the Divine embodiment of the sky as we've previously mentioned and was of course acknowledged being because of this as the supreme god in the Mesopotamian religion like so many other religions when we look for the highest upon the high the supremest being we tend to look up at the sky into the Stars the moon or the sun uh particularly the Sun as that is the engine in which life is brought to the Earth it seems to make sense his name is often written as Dan or danum reflected the numeral 60 associated with him he was revered as the king of the Gods and who held an ambiguous and illd defined nature functioning more of a symbolic Figure Head than an actively worshiped God despite his Paramount position enlil and later Marduk played more influential roles in practice for the daily lives of people and whose role shifted and only in urk during the first millennium BCE did theologians reinvent him as an active God astronomically Anu governed the Stars between enlil and E zones known as the ways and in sald times of Uruk he was linked to the entire firmament salusa times don't come until much later as salusa times were're referring to around after the death of Alexander the Great around 300 BC anu's iconography lacked recognizable anthropomorphic features with references to him often including symbols of divine kingship such as a scepter and a ring-shaped object depictions of Anu were rare but his symbol a horned crown on a pedestal appeared on kuduru and on Neo Assyrian reliefs much akin to symbols of enlil and assur and speaking of enlil let us explain enlil a little more also known as El he is a Mesopotamian deity associated with the wind the air the earth and the storms initially the chief deity in the Samarian Pantheon and they'll gained worship among the various situations civilizations rather including the acadians Babylonians Assyrians and the hurrians the central place of his veneration was the UR temple in nepur a city believed to have been constructed by enl himself symbolizing The Mooring rope that connected the heavens and the Earth Eno's prominence sured around the 24th century BC with the ascendancy of nepur described as so holy that even other gods could not bear to gaze upon Him Eno played a crucial role in many Samaran myths for example the Sumerian creation myth he separates Heaven on from the earth key making the world habitable by humans animals and everything in between en is featured prominently in the flood myths rewarding ziusudra with immortality in one version and causing the Deluge himself in another as humans noise Disturbed his rest perhaps it was a Sunday morning the myth of enlil and ninlil recounts enil's serial seduction of the Goddess ninlil leading to the conception of the Moon god Nana as well as the underworld deities nural ninazu and ENB belulu enil is credited as the inventor of the mat and serves as the patron of Agriculture several myths involve his son nerta including Tales like anzu and the tablet of Destinies and Lugal despite his earlier Eminence enil's cult waned after Nipper sack by the elamites in 12:30 BC and he was eventually surpassed by the Babylonian God Marduk in Mesopotamian Pantheon hierarchy enlil the patron God of nepur was revered at the UR Temple symbolizing the connection between Heaven and the Earth the samarians believe their existence serve the gods treating cult statues with reverence and offering constant care enel received worship through food offerings and ritual Feasts s and his priests had a great time attending to his statues needs portray as benevolent fatherly deity enel was seen as glorious and essential for civilization there is no Sumer without enlil epithets like the great mountain and King of the foreign lands served even greater to highlight his Grandeur enlil envisioned as a Creator and supreme Lord held titles such as nanir and was referred to as the East Wind and North Wind and because of this deep reverence that everybody had for him Kings did their best to emulate enil's just rule traveling to nepur for legitimacy even during the Babylonian period King sought recognition from nepur Eno's prominence Rose during the 24th century BC aligning with the decline of an he remained Paramount throughout the Amorite period however yet waned after Hammurabi's Conquest that's hamurabi of Babylon the one who wrote mori's code the Babylonians worshiped enil as El and during the cite period nepur G briefly regained influence around 1300 BC however enil merged with the Assyrian God assur and once again gained prominence in 1230 BC The ilite Invasion led to Nipper's decline and the new God Marduk eventually superseded enil as the head of the pantheon which means we arriv to eni enki the Samarian god of water knowledge crafts and creation was later known as a in the Acadian religion now that's spelled e a L lowercase a I do not know how to pronounce it so please do some research your own if you are that concerned with it but from here we will refer to uh the later name of enki as a originally the patron God of eridu that was another city uh around the same SI as Uruk and neur his influence spread across Mesopotamia Canaanite Hittites and hurrian circles eni was associated with constellations like the stars of a and the field or the square of Pegasus his numeric idiogram 40 became linked to him around the second millennium BC so once again a lot more ancient numerology from the samarians as uh they were quite keen on this practice eni's influence extended from Southern Iraq to the letine coast evident in can form inscriptions from the third millennium all the way to the helenistic period his identification with the planet Mercury later associated with Babylonian nabo persisted in Samarian time myths about eni abound reflecting his enduring prominence in the religion's religious and cultural narratives the primary Temple dedicated to eni was the a abzu meaning the abzu temple or House of subterranean Waters situated as a zigurat temple in the euphrati and marshlands near the ancient Persian Coastline at eridu this Temple known to be the first built in southern Iraq dates back to over 6,500 years to the earliest duad period over the subsequent 4500 years the temple underwent 18 different expansions before being abandoned during the Persian period as much of the old Bronze Age world was ninag that's our next one and this one's quite interesting also transcribed as nag narag or nuraga and known by alternate names damal Nuna or nma ninag was the ancient Samarian mother goddess of the mountains and one of seven Great deities of Samar in her earliest known role she served as a nurturing and fertility goddess often identified as the true and great lady of Heaven according to Temple hymns Kings of lagash were said to have been nourished by Nag's milk emphasizing their protective and nurturing qualities additionally she held the position of a tutelary deity for various Samarian leaders among her notable myths the stories of enki and ninag depict her interactions with Anki often stemming from his romantic Pursuits another well-known myth is enki and nma a creation narrative where the two deities compete in crafting humans ninag also plays a role as the mother of nerta in the anzu Epic and is referenced in many other Samarian myths liner's role in Samarian religion evolved over time of course encompassing various functions reflected in numerous names names epithets and worship areas associated with her cult initially found in smaller towns and Villages she may have been perceived more as a nurturing than a birth godess some theories also suggest an early connection to the birth of animals alongside the goddess Nur her association with child birth seems to have developed later leading her to being hailed as the Midwife who suckled by the kings of flash during the third early dynastic period Niner's epithets increasingly emphasized her as the Supreme mother of the world transcending a purely biological motherhood Concept in the Neo sumarian period she became more closely linked to the the physical process of birth has seen in offerings like umbilical cold Cutters while some propose a decline in her worship during the Babylonian period others argue that her cult remained revent relevant undergoing a shift as she assumed the role of bellet IL ninag played a documented role in the Samarian kingship ideology with votive gifts and dedications attesting to her significance Beyond her connection to the mountains she was seen as a personification of the earth as evidenced in texts describing The Season's creation through her Union with enlil associated with wild animal animal and in particular deer she appeared in the ritual incantations for diverse purposes including protection from demons and assistance in childbirth additionally her role in healing reflected in medical texts aligns with her nurturing aspect and Echoes the myth of eni and ninak and so those are the four main Gods and now we arrive to the three Sky gods that being inana or ishar Nana also known as Sin and utu also known as shamash and so for number one let's first explain in's role in the Pantheon she was the Mesopotamian Goddess that embodied love war and fertility with also deep associations to Beauty sex Divine Law and political power originally worshiped in suur she was also known as Ishtar to the akadian Empire you may remember the name ishar from the modern-day Recreation of the ancient monument in Iraq the ishar gates she was also uh important to the Babylonians the Assyrians and many others around the Mesopotamian region as the patron goddess of the aana temple in Uruk in Anana worship evolved in archaic Uruk and she was venerated in three forms reflecting the phases of Venus key symbols included The Lion and the eight-pointed star and her husband was dumuzid with nin shur as her sugal from the Uruk period onward in an's cult only kept growing and became widespread in the post sargonic area post sargonic area era meaning the time after the death of Sargon ofad the Acadian conqueror and if you are still listening at the moment if you've not drifted off to sleep I will remind you to like the video comment your thoughts down below and if you want more perhaps you would consider subscribing let's continue her influence extended to the Assyrians who elevated her above their National God ashure the cult persisted through the East semetic speaking peoples inor left a mark on the Hebrew Bible influenced goddesses like ashtart and AAR and possibly contributed to the development of Aphrodite in the Greek pantheon despite flourishing for centuries her cult gradually declined and between the first and sixth centuries CE people gradually went over to Christianity the new and cool religion inana featured in numerous myths often asserting dominance over other deities domains she received the mes from eni representing all all aspects of civilization and took control of the aana temple from an the sky God in enforcing Divine Justice with her twin brother utu she displayed her power punishing those who defied her Authority her descent into the underworld ruled by her sister ereshkigal is a famous myth where she faces judgment but is rescued by eni marking the cycle of Seasons with doids alternating presence in heaven and the underworld or sin also held a significant role as the Sumerian Moon God the names sin and nanao were used interchangeably even combined into the double name nanasu or nin not to be confused with naramin the ruler of later times another name associated with him was dilim Babar represented by lunar logo GRS he not only played an astral role but was also linked with cattle hering and potentially served as a judge of the Dead in the Underworld distinct Traditions depicted sin as equal in status to the usual heads of the Mesopotamian Pantheon enlil and Anu or even as a king of the Gods in his own right however this perspective had limited recognition in Mesopotamian art his symbol was the Crescent often seen in headwear or a top of staff were anthropomorphically depicted Boats were also associated with him and many people prayed to him during their sea voyages ningal the goddess was regarded as sin's wife and their notable children included inana ishar and utu shamash other deities like nul blaga or Numa were also considered part of this Divine family sin had an attendant deity Alas and various courtiers like ninara nura and ninava he was further connected with lunar Gods such as huran kusu and and thetic Yik the primary cult Center for sin was Ur where his Temple Enis nugal stood from the early dtic period ER was recognized as sin's tutelary deity and divine ruler the temple underwent multiple rebounds by various Mesopotamian rulers haran also became significant in the first millennium BCE as a center for sin's worship reflecting in neoti Neo Assyrian and Neo Babylonian sourcers sin's influence extended to other cities like tutub Babylon Uruk nippur and assur with his Temple standing as Testament to his widespread veneration the extent to which beliefs about Sin in influence to the sabians of haran a religious community post Muslim Conquest is still a matter of scholarly debate and now we arrive at shamash let's talk about shamash then we've mentioned his name a few times he was also known as utu and he was the ancient Mesopotamian Sun God overseeing the world's events and ensuring Justice and protection for travelers as a Divine judge he could be associated with the underworld and was revered in the cities of sear and Larsa the moon god Nana and ningal were his parents with his twin sister being inana ishar Aya was his wife and their daily reunions were believed to take place where the sun set how very romantic utu had various siblings including truth personified in kitum and dream deities like Mamu his name was used logog graphically for foreign solar deities notably the huran god shimigy although no specific myths focus on utu he frequently appears as an ally in the Sumerian and Acadian compositions notably he protected deui from Underworld demons assisted gilgames in defeating humbaba aided inana in acquiring the aana temple and offered guidance in the myth of how grain came to Sumer of course worth a read that one I'll make a video on that later he held a prominent position among the Mesopotamian deities as the son God his significance is evident in various God lists where he ranks quite High revered as a God of Justice he was characterized by epithets such as Youth and hero his role extended beyond the celestial also who was believed to Traverse the sky daily in his solar Chariot the cosmic journey of utu depicted through sunrise and sunset symbolized the movement of the sun through the cosmic Gates often drawn by iids or lions U association with Dawn represented by his wife a is described in texts betraying their daily reunions on a mountain where the sun was thought to set U's role as a Divine judge was also integral to Mesopotamian beliefs his ability to witness all happenings on Earth coupled with collaboration with other judges like ishan contributed to his reputation for justice the connection with the underworld emerged over time influencing rituals and exorcisms where utu was invoked to guide the Restless Souls Beyond this judicial role Udu played a crucial part in divination particularly in collaboration with the other deity adad ritual texts highlight their responsibility for teaching divination to King Ed duranki who subsequently disseminated this knowledge to the key Mesopotamian cities UT's multifaceted character underscores his profound impact on Mesopotamian religion and culture combining Cosmic significance Justice and divination in a complex web of beliefs and practices the worship practices and religious structure of ancient Su were deeply ingrained in the culture and worship of society in the city states now here are some key aspects of the Samarian worship what was it like to go about your daily routines under the guidance of Samarian religion well let's have a look now Samaran myths were initially transmitted orally until the Advent of writing the earliest discovered myth the Epic of bilges is written in Samarian on clay tablets early cona form primarily a recordkeeping tool evolved into religious r writings such as Temple praise hymns and incantations called Nam sub architecture and temporal development in the early stages Samaran temples were quite small elevated one room structures but as civilization progressed temples evolved with raised Terraces and multiple rooms ziggurats towering structures with stepped platforms became the preferred Temple style temples served as cultural religious and political hubs until around 2500 BC when political and Military leadership shifted to separate Palace complexes Samarian city states operated under a virtually theocr rtic government before the emergence of the Lugal or King various n or NC acting as high priests controlled the Cults of City Gods priests played a crucial role in maintaining cultural and religious Traditions acting as mediators between humans and Cosmic forces they resided within the temple complexes themselves overseeing state matters including the very important matter of irrigation processes some Samarian cities experienced periods where their kings were woried as Gods much in the way of what was happening in Egypt at the time occasionally this practice extended to Encompass multiple cities in the region but what about the ceremonial practices well during the third dynasty of er the city state of lagash boasted 62 lamentation priests accompanied by 180 vocalists and instrumentalists showcasing the elaborate ceremonial aspects of Samaran worship and with its Rich mythology distinctive architecture and intricate priesthood it laid the foundation for subsequent Mesopotamian cultures and influen broader aspect of ancient near Eastern belief systems themselves the samarians envisioned the universe as a closed Dome enveloping a primordial saltwater sea this dome overseen by the deity an remember the name an is prominance with Sky enclosed a terrestrial Earth beneath which lay an underworld and a fresh water ocean called the abzu the Earth was personified as key initially considered an extension of the Goddess key but later evolving into the concept of Kur the primordial saltwater sea initially named namu became Tiamat during during and after the er3 period but how did it all come about well the samarians like anybody else has a creation myth everyone has to have one and so the Samaran creation myth primarily found in the prologue to the epic poem of Gilgamesh enidu and the Nether world recounts the origin of how our world came to be now how did that happen well initially namu the Primeval sea gave birth to an the sky and key the earth now remember that word primeval it means it's been there forever since time in Memorial an and Key's Union resulted in the birth of enlil the god of wind rain and storm enlil then separated from an and key taking the Earth as his domain while an claimed the sky in Mesopotamian belief the sky comprised a series of Domes covering the Flat Earth often three but sometimes seven each Dome was crafted from from a distinct precious stone with the lowest Dome housing the Stars the middle Dome housing the igigi and the outmost Dome personified as an the god of the sky celestial bodies such as Venus the sun and the moon were also equated with specific deities inana utu and Nana respectively heaven was solely the Abode of the Gods and you weren't invited ordinary Mortals were destined for the underworld known as KL orala after death Well it can't be all that bad right you've been a very good boy how bad could the afterlife be well unfortunately the Samarian afterlife was a somber realm situated deep beneath the Earth Earth ruled by the cruel goddess aesal described in various sources as a dark Cavern K offered its inhabitants a shadowy continuation of Earthly existence All Souls regardless of their actions in life converged in this underworld where they consumed only dry dust family members poured Libations into the graves through through clay pipes allowing the dead to symbolically drink wealthy Graves included Treasures meant as offerings to utu and anunaki believed to Garner special favors for that poor person stuck down in the Underworld now during the third dynasty of er the treatment in Souls of the afterlife was thought to hinge on burial practices Sumptuous burials promise favorable treatment while meager burials resulted in poorer conditions potentially leading to Haunting of the living by discontented Spirits otherwise you'll be having some sleepless evenings now how do you get into CER do you just float down there or what well actually the entrance to ker the underworld was thought to be in the Zagros Mountains guarded by seven Gates netti the gatekeeper played a crucial role in guiding Souls through these Gates ereshkigal's messenger Namar and a class of demons known as as Gala resided in the Underworld Gala demons often depicted as seven in number were believed to drag unfortunate Mortals back to Kerr numerous texts describe their involvement including dragging of the god dumuzid into the underworld in later periods the acadians referred to this realm as irala and ares's rulership was lat to transferred to nurgle the god of death with attempts to reconcile their roles by making nurgle ares's husband and before we finish up with the video Let's just quickly remind ourselves of some of the timelines we've been through so the early years of Sumerian civilization it likely began around 4 500 4,000 BC with our earliest historical dating records going to around 2900 BC the samarians of course practice this polytheism that I've just explained attributing anthropomorphic qualities to deities representing Cosmic and terrestrial forces the initial Pantheon featured four primary deities them being un enlil ninag and eni often engaging in Cooperative creative activities now around the time of the mid3 millennium BC the area went through urbanizations and a somewhat of a change in the pantheon led to a transformation in Samarian societies and the changes in some of the beliefs changes in some names and Gods Not So Much acting as kings of cities anymore we had actual Kings by then that being said each city state had adopted their Patron deity and prayed to it believing them to protect and defend its interest although many of those deities lost their original associations with nature and Raba were just simply associated with that City and it brings us to the late 2000s BC where the acadians conquered the samarians syncretizing their gods with the Samaran ones Samarian religion took on a semetic coloration with male deities gaining dominance the original associations of gods with natural phenomena were lost and a feudal society structure was imposed upon the Divine Pantheon deities like enlil and inana were perceived as deriving their power from the chief God enlil and that's all we have time for today I'd like to thank you for joining me on this long and very interesting journey into old Samarian religion and that long forgotten but as of the last one hour slightly resurrected Pantheon I'm the ASMR historian now that we're acquainted perhaps you'd like to hear more and subscribe do whatever you want it's been a pleasure good night sweet dreams hello again and a warm welcome to those new to the channel and to those returning I hope that those who have returned have so far found something of value within the video whether it's just to relax you and lull you off to sleep or whether it's just to provide you with a new perspective or learning something new well today we're continuing that theme of one learning about our ancient histories and two about our Bronze Age civilizations part of history that is unfortunately as interesting as it is forgotten and ignored but we won't tolerate such a thing on this channel because I am the ASMR historian and I'm here to tell you all about the Hittites so like And subscribe and let's begin the hites were an ancient Anatolian Indo-European people possibly originating from Beyond the Black Sea who settled in modern day turkey in the early 2nd millennium BC they established various polities in north central Anatolia such as the kingdom of casara before 1750 BC and the kenesh or Nesha Kingdom around 1750 BC eventually they formed the powerful hittite Empire centered on husa around 1650 BC the Empire reaching its Zenith in the mid 14th century BC under and forgive my hitte pronunciation suul the first extended across most of Anatolia and parts of the northern Levant and upper Mesopotamia the Levant refers to areas around Syria Palestine and Mesopotamia is the region between the two rivers tigis and Euphrates in modern day Iraq and some small sections of modern day Iran between the 15th and 13th centuries BC the hites played a prominent role as a dominant power in the near East they engaged in conflicts with the New Kingdom of Egypt the middle Assyrian Empire and the Empire of mitani however by the 12th century BC much of the hittite empire fell under control of the the middle Assyrian Empire while the remaining territories were sacked by fian newcomers during the late Bronze Age collapse in the late 12th century BC the hites fragmented into several small independent states some survived until the 8th Century BC eventually succumbing to the Neo Assyrian Empire without it unifying continuity the descendants of the Hittites scattered and merged into the modern populations of the Levant and Mesopotamia the hiide language known as nessi belonged to the Anatolian branch of the Indo-European language family alongside the closely related louan language it is the oldest historically attested Indo-European language information about the hitti civilization primarily comes from Kuna form texts discovered in their former territories as well as diplomatic and Commercial correspondence found in various archives of Assyria Babylonia Egypt and the broader Middle East the decipherment of these texts marked a crucial development in indoeuropean studies some cultural links to prehistoric Scandinavia have also been suggested believe it or not the hites were once thought to have monopolized iron working during the Bronze Age however this theory has been somewhat contested by many sources in the 21st century well in fact the spread of iron working technology appears to have been a slow but continuous process across the region during the late Bronze Age collapse and subsequent Iron Age while some iron objects from Bronze Age Anatolia exist their number is comparable to those found in Egypt and other contemporary locations only a small portion of these objects are weapons and there is evidence that suggesting that most or all Iron from the Bronze Age is divided from meteorites believe it or not all the way from space how interesting now onto the hittite military you can't have a civilization without a a good group of soldiers to protect it can't you and actually the hittite military was quite successful much because of its use of Chariots modern interest in the Hittites grew after the founding of the Republic of Turkey in 1923 Turkish archaeologists such as halet Campbell and tassin osuk played a crucial role in exploring hitti history history the field of hittitology also influenced the naming of many Turkish institutions including the state-owned etti bank or hittite bank as the Turkish in modern times understand it can you believe that a modern bank called the hittite bank would you imagine a bank in Iraq called the the bank of Sumer or the bank of Babylon something like this that's amazing I love that Additionally the Museum of Anatolian civilizations in Ankara located west of the hittite capital of husa was established during this period it houses an extensive exhibition of hittite Art and artifacts making it the most comprehensive collection of hitti cultural items in the world and definitely worth a visit the hites refer to their Kingdom as husa known as hati in aradian aradian is referring to the kingdom of accad ruled over by Sargon which we discussed in a different video this would be that Kingdom between the tigis and Euphrates of the old Sumer and so the hiis refer to their the kingdom as husa a name derived from the Haans an earlier people who had inhabited and ruled Central Anatolia until around the 2 millennium BC now the Haans didn't speak the hittite language they however spoke an unrelated language and it was called hatic whether or not they calleded them themselves is perhaps up debate but we are going to understand it the same as the way the people from England speak English or the Germans speak German so let's keep it simple for the moment the modern name Hittites was coined due to the initial Association of the people of husa with the biblical hit heits by 19th century archaeologists the h likely referred to themselves something closer to nites or nesian after the city of Nesha however around 1650 BC King labara renamed himself hatus the first now that means the man of husa and he established his Capital there at husa leading to the adoption of the named for the Kingdom so that's where it all came from very proud of his home City if only we could all be so patriotic so let's talk about the archaeological discovery of the Hittites how did we find out about this fascinating group of people in these ancient times that we've dug their story Out of the Dust of the ground well before the archaeological discoveries that unveiled the hitti civilization the primary source and really the only source for information about the Hittites had actually been the Hebrew Bible as the Hebrew Bible is more or less said all in Bronze Age times and the times before the New Testament where Jesus had came so it is all BC and you'll find mentions of the Babylonians in the Hebrew Bible as well now whether or not you are that way inclined to uh believe in religious matters I won't say which way I feel about it it's still a good idea to read through the old texts in the Hebrew Bible if not just for your own entertainment and for a little bit of understanding of how Western literature works and how these societies were perceived by secondary sources those many many years ago so in the early 19th century Francis William Newman expressed a critical view common at the time suggesting that no hittite King could have compared in power to the king of Judah however as archaeological findings in the second half of the 19th century revealed the extent of the hittite Kingdom Scholars like archal SE argued that the Anatolian civilization was infinitely more powerful than that of Judah and should be compared to the divided Kingdom of Egypt divided Kingdom of Egypt were also talking about the upper and lower parts remember the upper part of Egypt was the South part of the Nile as it flows that way while the lower part we are talking about the Nile Delta of near modern day Alexandria where it's a lot more Lush and frankly quite nicer to live well I digress back to the Hittites sorry for that Excursion back to ancient Egypt but we'll get back to Anatolia now so sa and others noted that according to the Hebrew texts Judah and the Hittites were not enemies instead they were actually allies the book of Kings mentions that the Hittites supplied the Israelites with cedar chariots and horses while in the Book of Genesis they were depicted as friends and allies to Abraham Uriah the hittite even served as a captain in King David's Army listed among his mighty men in 1 Chronicles verse 11 so who were the actual people who made the initial discoveries well the French scholar Charles texier discovered the first hitti ruins all the way back in 18 1834 however at the time he did not initially know what he was looking at so he couldn't just pull it out of the ground and say ah it's the Hittites I found them no he didn't identify them as such the initial archaeological evidence for the Hittites emerged from tablets found at the karon of Kesh which is present day cepe in Turkey these tablets contained records of trade between Assyrian merchants and a region referred to as the land of hati some names in the tablets were not hatic or Assyrian but exhibited a clear indoeuropean characteristic in writing in 1884 William Wright discovered a monument at bogas C with hieroglyphic scripts from a group known as the people of hausas not husa but hatas these scripts were found to match those from Aleppo and hmer in Northern Syria subsequently in 1887 excavations at Amaro in Egypt revealed diplomatic correspondence between the Pharaoh Aman hotep and akatan two of the letters mentioned a kingdom of Keta in the same general region as the Mesopotamian references to the land of hati while these letters were written in standard Acadian kuna form they were however in an unknown language so it's like if we would write something in English English however all the world words would look like gibberish to us regardless of using the same Latin script that was what it was like when they found this although Scholars could interpret its sounds the language itself remained completely incomprehensible following these discoveries archal say proposed that hati or kti in an toon was identical to the kingdom of Keta mentioned in the Egyptian text and the biblical Hittites while some Scholars like Max merer suggested connecting kti with Biblical ktim caa's identification gained widespread acceptance during the early 20th century the name hittite became associated with the civilization uncovered at bascoy the hi kingdom was centered around the lands encompassing husa and Nessa also known as by its modern day name kulpe collectively known as the land of hati or in their language urua following atusa's establishment as the capital the region defined by the bend of the Kil Alik River hitti marasa Greek helis was regarded as the core of the Empire hitide laws even made distinctions between this side of the river and that side of the river with higher bounties for escape slaves who had fled Beyond on the river compared to those who were caught on the nearest side to the west and south of the core territory lay the region initially referred to us as louah in the earliest hittite texts this term later gave way to names arzawa and katna with the rise of these other kingdoms however the HIIT continue to use the term Luan to denote the original language originating from these areas before the rise of katna the central region in celesia was first known to the Hittites as adania after revolting from the Hittites during the reign of amuna it adopted the name katna and expanded northward including the lower and hus mountains to the north of the hitti where the mountain dwelling caskin and to the southeast lay the huran Empire of mitani at its Zenith during the reign of mercil II The Hite Empire extended from arzawa in the west to mitani in the East covering much of the cas in territories to the north reaching as far as hayasa AI in the far Northeast and extending South into Canan near the southern border of Lebanon and now let's talk about the origins of the Hittites the ancestors of the Hittites entered Anatolia between 4400 and 4100 BC coinciding with the split of the Anatolian language family from Proto indoeuropean recent genetic and archaeological studies suggest that Proto Anatolian speakers arrived in the regions sometime between 5,000 and 3,000 BC the Proto hittite language itself emerged around 2100 BC and the the HTE language itself is believed to have been in use in central Anatolia between the 20th and 12th centuries BC the Hittites are initially associated with the kingdom of kusara before 1750 during the Bronze Age the Hittites in Anatolia coexisted with the hatian and hurrians either through conquest or gradual assimilation either through conquest or gradual assimilation archaeologically there are connections to the ezero culture of the bulans and mop culture of the caucuses had been considered within a migration framework according to analysis by David W Anthony in 2007 step herders who were archaic Indo-European speakers migrated into the lower Damu Valley around 4200 to 4,000 BC potentially causing or taking advantage of the collapse of Old Europe Anthony suggests that their languages likely included in archaic Proto indoeuropean dialects partly preserved later in Anatolian and their descendants may have been moved into Anatolia at an unknown time possibly around 3,000 BC the origins and migration patterns of the Hittites have been a subject of scholarly debate the indigenous inhabitants of central Anatolia were primarily the hurrians and Haans who spoke non indoeuropean languages the hites initially adopted the Cana form script from the Assyrian colonies in the region during the old Assyrian Empire from around 2025 to 1750 BC following the collapse of the old Assyrian Empire however it took time for the Hittites to establish themselves with various hittite groups centered around different cities strong rulers eventually unified these groups centered in husa and conquered large parts of central Anatolia to establish the hittite kingdom and so let's look at the early history now of the Hittites The Hite State emerged from numerous small polies in central Anatolia along the kilak river I did my best don't laugh during the middle Bronze Age middle Bronze Age being around 1900 to 1650 BC the early history of the hitti kingdom is known through several tablets including these four cushion shaped tablets that are classified by very boring names such as kbo 3.22 and 3.22 .1 and so on now these tablets were probably created in kusara Nessa or another Anatolian State and they were written in the old hittite language they revealed a rivalry within two branches of the royal family during the Middle Kingdom Palace intrigues the northern Branch was initially based on Z alur and later in husa while the southern Branch was centered in kusara and the former Assyrian colony of kanesh the northern and southern branches are distinguishable by their names the Northerners retained language isolate hatian names while the southerners adopted indoeuropean hittite and lubian names zalu initiated an attack on Kesh under King unaa in 1833 BC during this period known as the karum period when the merchant colony of all the Syrian Empire was flourishing in the area several Kings reigned including her panu for a short time in 1790 BC inar for around 25 years and vas for around the same 25 years ending his reign in 1750 BC the Anita text a set of tablets describes how Pana the king of kusara conquered the neighboring city of Nessa or Kesh around 1750 BC the tablets focus on Pan's son who continued his father's conquest by capturing several Northern cities including husa and zura before I forget to mention his name pit Han's son's name was Anita for all you people waiting for the trivia question to come up on the chase if they ever ask Bronze Age questions on the chase they really should Anita cursed husa in the tablet reflecting the Rivalry between the Southern and Northern branches of the royal family another set of tablets the tale of zura supports zura and exonerates hatus Sil the first from the charge of sacking Kesh after Anita zuu who reigned from 1720 to 1710 succeeded as a king around 1710 to 1705 BC Kesh was destroyed leading to the collapse of the long established Assyrian Merchant trading system the Karan noyal royal family survived to challenge the zalan and husan family though their direct lineage to Anita is uncertain and so in the midst of these interesting avents these two families going at each other the Lords of zala continued to exist huya the first a descendant of aalan Lord took control of harti while his son-in-law labana the first originally from hulma in the mountain south of kusara usurped the throne labara the first adopted jia's grandson hat and his own son and Air as his own son and Heir which brings us into from the early times into the Old Kingdom which is somewhat newer than the older Kingdom before it well the founding of the hittite Kingdom the Old Kingdom is attributed to either labna the first or hatus the first the L might have also had labana as a personal name as we have mentions of both of these rulers and so this person whether it be labara or hatus Sil conquered the area south and north of husa hatus campaigned as far as the citic Amorite Kingdom of yamad in Syria where he attacked but did not capture its capital of Aleppo you've heard that name haven't you that City in Syria that's how old it is old enough to be withstanding attacks from Hittites now that's impressive hatu silly did eventually capture husa and was credited for the foundation of the hittite empire so remember when somebody asks you who founded the hittite Empire you can tell them with pretty good confidence hatus Sil the first hatu Sil was King and his sons Brothers in-laws family members and troops were all United wherever he went on campaign he controlled the enemy land with Force he destroyed the lands one after the other took away their power and made them the borders of the sea when he came back from campaign however each of his sons went somewhere to a country and in his hand the great cities prospered however when the later Prince's servants became corrupt they began to Devour the properties conspired constantly against against their masters and began to shed their blood what I just read for you was an exerpt from the Edict of telepinu dating to the 16th century BC is thought to highlight the unification growth and prosperity of the Hittites under telepinu rule however it also indicates the issue of corruption among the princes assumed to be his sons the available sources however do not provide Clarity on how tupu address the corruption on his deathbed hat Sil chose his grandson mercil or Mish I first as his successor the decision marked a significant moment in the hittite succession and Leadership transition merile after succeeding huili I first continued the conquests and launched a significant campaign down the Euphrates River around 1595 BC during his campaign he bypassed Assyria and sacked Mari and Babylon ejecting the Amorite rulers of the old bonian Empire instead of directly incorporating Babylonia into hittite domains mercil handed control of Babylonia to his cite allies who went on to rule it for the next four centuries concerned about potential revolts in hati however mercil did not stay in Babylon for an extended period and quickly rushed home on the rumors of some naughty ny's planning a rebellion because we can't have that can't we The Strain on Hardy's resources due to the lengthy campaign left the capital in state of near Anarchy during his journey back to husa or shortly after his return Mercy was actually killed by his brother-in-law HTI the first leading to a chaotic situation in the hittite Kingdom HTI took the throne but faced internal unrest and murder attempts after all he did not get there on his own merits and killing the guy who's above you is not really considered good form his family including his wife harab and her son were also so murdered how much they had to do with this political situation remains a matter of debate but that's a shame that they had to be dragged into the situation zidan the first who was responsible for some of these killings was also later murdered by his own son amuna all of this internal strife weakened the hittite Roy family and the huran seize the opportunity to expand their influence it's very very hard to run an Empire when you're just trying not to get killed in your own house every day so that's when you take your eyes off the business and things begin to get very difficult and in come the huran those hurrians residing in the mountainous region along the upper Tigris and Euphrates rivers took control of Aleppo and surrounding areas as well as the coastal region of adania renaming it to kizu watna later celissia throughout the remainder of the 16th century BC hittite kings were preoccupied with dynastic quarrels and warfare against the hurrians resulting in a decline in the hit's power this period of internal strife and external pressure from The hurrians Marked a challenging phase for the hide Kingdom the campaigns into amuru and southern Mesopotamia during this time may have played a role in reintroducing Cana form writing into Anatolia with the hit script differing significantly from earlier Assyrian Colonial period script after the tumultuous events following mercel's the first Reign the hitide kingdom entered a weak phase characterized by obscure records insignificant rumors and reduced domains this sat of expansion under strong Kings followed by a contraction under weaker ones became a recurring theme throughout the hittite Kingdom's 500-year history making it challenging to reconstruct events during the period's decline the political instability during the Old hitti Kingdom prior to 1400 BC can be attributed in part to the nature of hittite kingship at the time unlike the Pharaohs of Egypt the king of the Hittites was not perceived as a living God by his subjects but rather as a first among equals that's a little bit more fair isn't it it was only during the later period from 1400 to 1200 BC that hittite kingship became more Central ized and Powerful they must have taken a note out of the Egyptians book in how to better control the people in the earlier years the succession was not legally fixed leading to rivalries between the northern and southern branches reminiscent of the War of the Roses in English History now we'll talk about that later the next significant Monarch after Mercy the first was tipu who ruled around 1500 BC telpo achieved a few victories to the Southwest seemingly by forming alliances with hurrian States including kisua against others particularly mitani in addition to military efforts TPU sought to secure the lines of succession during his Reign the last Monarch of the Old Kingdom telipo reigned until around 500 BC his Reign marked the transition from the Old Kingdom to the subsequent weak phase known as the Middle Kingdom the period of the 15th century BC is relatively obscure with few surviving records and the Hittites faced constant attacks during this time particularly from the casian a non-indo European people settled along the shores of the Black Sea it's hard to keep records when somebody is aiming a arrow at your head but I really really wish they had tried harder so I could make the video longer but that's okay we can't blame them for that well the hitti capital underwent several relocations because of this moving first to sapu and then to samua while there is an archive in saua its contents have not been adequately translated date now I myself lack the skills to translate them but if anyone ends up listening to this who does have the skills to translate them please hurry up I'm getting very impatient of waiting well this period sets the stage for the hitti Empire period that officially begins with the reign of Talia around 1430 BC an important innovation credited to these early hittite rulers is the practice of conducting treaties and alliances with neighboring states the Hittites were among the earliest Pioneers in the art of international politics and diplomacy during this time Additionally the hittite religion saw influences from the hurrians with the adoption of several gods and rituals from this neighboring culture with the reign of Talala toala rather the hitti kingdom entered the Hite Empire period marked by a strengthening of kingship settlements progressed primarily in South Anatolia and treaties were signed with neighboring peoples the kingship became hereditary acquiring a superhuman Aura and the King was revered as the son that's Su n not s o n The Hite Kings of this era acted also as high priests overseeing holy cities and conducting festivals so it's somewhat how Samarian religion worked a lot of of people would take a leaf out of the samarians books and uh later on do things how they did them King Talia the first during his Reign around 14400 BC allied with kisua conquered herrian States like Aleppo and mitani and expanded Westward at the expense of arzawa aluan State following to Haria I first a weak phase ensued allowing enemies to advance to husa and raise it it didn't last long however the kingdom regained its Glory under and forgive me for the sounded out pronunciation Su lul liuma the first around 1350 BC I'm really struggling with these hittite names aren't I so suuma conquered Aleppo again he then reduced matani to a vasage and he completely defeated Kish despite the Hite Empire's growth the ascendant middle Assyrian Empire began to encroach on hitti territory during sua's rule the hiide Empire faced a devastating taramia epidemic leading to the deaths of suuma and his successor Aranda II from what I hear this disease is somewhat like tuberculosis mercil II who reigned from 1330 BC another son of his succeeded him and attacked arzawa during the weakened State caused by the epidemic in response to arawan attacks the Hittites employed a form of biological warfare by sending infected Rams perhaps one of the earliest known forms of biological warfare that lovely thing that everybody enjoys mercil II also targeted mettus under AA was control now that there miletus is also referred to as milanda and it is believed to refer to Myan Greece so this shows that they probably would have been crossing the sea as well so well done on the boat building not everybody can do that and it brings us to somewhat of a death nail for the hites can you guess what battle it is I'll give you a moment it starts with a K it's the Battle of Kadesh good job if you got it the prosperity of the Hittites hinged on controlling trade routs and metal sources Northern Syria a critical area connecting with the cian gates with Mesopotamia played a vital role in that defense now the rise of Egyptian expansion under Pharaoh rameses II began to test the hittite dominance the Battle of cadesa outcome remains uncertain with Egyptian reinforcements preventing a total hitti Victory the conflict forced the Hittites into the Fortress of Kadesh but Egyptian losses prevented them from sustaining a Siege this pivotal battle occurred in the fifth year of rameses around 1274 BC based on the commonly used chronology now after this date 1274 BC the hittite and Egyptian Powers declined due to Assyrian ascendancy shmina the first exploited the now weakened Hittites conquering hura and mitani and extending control up to the Euphrates Assyria a formidable threat to hiti trade routes overshadowed Egypt's influence UB briefly ruled but was oued by his uncle hat toili II amid Assyrian annexations to counter Assyrian aggression hat toili the third formed an alliance with rameses II resulting in the Treaty of cadesh in 1258 BC a landmark pack fixing boundaries in southern Canan the treaty included the marriage of a hiti princess to rames II solidifying new diplomatic time Talia IV the final strong hittite King struggled to repel Assyrian incursions into the hittite Heartland experiencing losses in territory notably in the Battle of nya against tukul NTA I first despite a temporary annexation of Cyprus even that fell to Assyria eventually what a mess for the Hittites it was not going very well for them at all the last Monarch suu liuma II did manage to achieve some victories including a naval Triumph against alashia near Cyprus however the Assyrians led by ashur rash isi I first had already annexed substantial hitti territory in asiia minor and Syria the expansion also saw a defeat and expulsion of the Babylonian King Nebuchadnezzar the first who had his eyes on hittite lands as well they were good lands everybody wanted a piece of the hittite territory and now everybody was getting a piece of the hittite territory and then come in the new mysterious main characters the sea peoples initiated their Southward migration along the Mediterranean Coast commencing in the aan and reaching Canan founding the state of philistia they seize celissia and Cyprus from the Hittites disrupting vital trade roads vulnerable from all sides the hitti homelands including husa succumb to attack in around 1180 BC we're talking waves of Invaders including the casan frians and bries and they all contributed to the demise of the hittite kingdom it was just all too much to handle internal issues compounded external threats marking the end of the Kingdom within the broader context of the Bronze Age collapse they h weren't alone at this time pretty much everywhere was collapsing Egypt survived though barely but they did survive a study of tree rings indicated a shift to drier conditions from the 13th to the 12th century BC featuring consecutive droughts in 1196 97 and 98 three years of poor harvests are enough to do anybody in if you don't starve to death your people would certainly start to consider moving to greener pastures though around that time there was not much green to be had well the Bronze Age collapse is essentially where it ends for the Hittites but we can still talk a little bit about what the Hittites were like in terms of their government systems and some of their social practices so let's have a quick look at that before we end up today the hites are credited with developing one of the earliest known constitutional monarchies in their system the king held the highest Authority serving as the supreme ruler military commander chief judge and high priest the air apparent followed in importance while the king had diers responsibilities various officials wielded independent authority over the different branches of the government among these the gal meedi or the chief of the royal bodyguards played a crucial role later succeeded by the gestin the chief of the wine stewards often a member of the royal family the gal dubar chief of the scribes led the king Kingdom's bureaucracy with specific Authority not extending to the legal dubar the king's personal scribe in diplomatic relations Egyptian monarchs engaged with the Hittites through two key seats of power Kadesh situated on the orontes river and kimesh located on the Euphrates river in southern Anatolia the religion of the early Hittites was marked by a syncretic approach as seen in the central Anatolian settlement of anua here the worship of the preh hittite Goddess Katara and other hatic deities highlighted ethnic distinctions in religion under hittite control originally named hanum kataha underwent a Recon configuration by the Hittites according to Ronald goury this renaming served to diminish the preh hittite identity of the female deity and align her more closely with hittite traditions this practice of transforming and reconfiguring local deities was a strategic move by the Hittites to legitimize their Authority avoid conflicting ideologies in newly Incorporated ated regions and promote acceptance of hittite Customs among local communities by adapting the beliefs of these communities to their own the Hittites aimed to align traditional religious practices with their political and economic goals the hide languages documented in fragments dating back to the 19th century BC as seen seen in the cepe texts specifically mentioning the goddess isara with a name like ishara one does wonder if there's a relation to the goddess ishar in Sumer but that's just a bit of late video conjecture from me at the moment its usage persisted until approximately 1100 BC hittite stands out as the most well documented language within the Anatolian branch of the Indo-European language family it holds the distinction of being the earliest Indo-European language with surviving written attestations evident in isolated hitte lone words and numerous personal names found in older Syrian contexts as early as the 20th century BC The Hite Empire Des despite its vast size has left relatively few remains of its art notable examples include Monumental carvings Rock reliefs metal work like the alaka hoyuk bronze standards intricately C VI Ivory and Ceramics like these husi and vases that are quite famous you can see I believe they're in the museum in anchara among the larger just constructed sculptures are the Sphinx Gates of alaka hoek and husa along with the monument at the spring of eatan Pinar additionally there are several large recumbent lions with the lion of Babylon statue at Babylon potentially being the largest hitti example although its hittite origin is uncertain it may have just just been the Babylons doing it themselves Babylonians rather many of these artifacts exhibit significant wear Rock reliefs such as the haneri relief and the hemay relief also contribute to the hitti artistic Legacy the NJ de Stella dating from the end of the 8th Century BC stands as a louan monument from the post hittite period discovered in the modern Turkish city of nigde the hiide laws like other records of the empire were inscribed on conform tablets made from baked clay the known hide law code was primarily derived from two clay tablets each containing 186 articles compiling laws practiced across the early hittite Kingdom monuments with hittite K form inscriptions in central Anatolia also describe the government and legal codes of the Empire these legal records span the Old hittite Kingdom the Old hittite Kingdom being from 1650 to 1500 BC and to the New hittite Kingdom from 1500 to 1180 1180 being around the time of the Bronze Age collapse typically attested by a modern chronology over this period different translations reveal a series of legal reforms that modernize language and introduce more Humane punishments for various crimes whether they're Humane by modern standards or hittite standards remains a topic of debate these changes May may be attributed to shifts in leadership or evolving linguistic interpretations similar to biblical laws in Exodus and Deuteronomy the hiide law codes specify fines and punishments for specific crimes and also provide guidance on matters like inheritance and death but it's nothing like the code of hamurabi from Babylon of which I do plan on doing a full reading of which may perhaps be a three-hour long video but I'll do it because why not but Hey listen that's enough about the Hittites for now I think their story has been explained the best that I can explain it from those early days to the Battle of cadesh and the Bronze Age collapse the sea people sealing the fate and the droughts coming in and ending them that final nail in the coffin if you want to do any more research on the Hittites then I hand the reins over to you I think that it's definitely a topic that deserves being researched more thoroughly I'm now going to leave you with the sounds of the fireplace and I hope that it love you off into a deep relaxing sleep because we've learned so much tonight go and dream about the old world good night sweet dreams hello there and welcome back to ASMR historian it's history that will put you to sleep today we're going to continue our current theme of this month in our new year 2024 of Bronze Age societies and the history around Bronze Age collapse so today as per the title of the video we're going to be looking at Sumer a very important and very large Society of the Bronze Age so find somewhere to relax close your eyes and we can begin now to learn all about the history of Sumer Sumer emerging during the chaali lithic and early bronze ages between the 6th and fourth millennium BC is the earliest known civilization in southern Mesopotamia which is now modernday South Central Iraq alongside Elum it is considered one of the cradles of civilization along with Egypt the Indus Valley erang culture kupe and meso America settled along the tigas and Euphrates rivers Sumerian farmers cultivated abundant crops leading to the formation of stable Urban settlements the world's earliest known texts dating between 3350 and 2500 BC originated from Sumerian cities like Uruk and gemet nassa following a period of protor writing around 4,000 to 25 00 BC the term Sumer or in the local language suu originates from the Acadian name for the Sumerians the ancient non-semitic speaking inhabitants of the southern Mesopotamia in their inscriptions the samarians called their land kengar meaning the country of the noble Lords and their language igar so when we refer to the local language we're speaking about Acadian as that was the dominant language at the time especially uh before the sargonic period where Saron ofad conquered most of the areas around Mesopotamia so just a reminder the samarians called their land kangar meaning country of the noble Lords and they call their language Samarian Emir the origin of these samarians actually to this day remains somewhat unknown we don't know where they came from but they refer to themselves as the blackheaded ones or blackheaded people for instance Sumerian king Shuli identified himself as the king of the four quarters the pastor of the blackheaded people The acadians Who later conquered the Samarian city states and spoke Semitic Acadian language also referred to these samarians as blackheaded people or in their language salmat kadi the phological development of the term SMU given by acadians actually remains uncertain and there are Western variants such as Hebrew inar Egyptian SAR and hittite anhar or anhara and all three of those terms indicated Southern Mesopotamia the area in which the Sumerians were predominantly in control most historians propose that Sumer was initially settled between 5500 and 3300 BC by a West Asian people who spoke the Sumerian language they base this assertion on evidence such as the names of cities Rivers basic occupations and more Samaran is considered a non-semitic and non- indoeuropean language isolate various theories about the origin of these samarians have been proposed some suggest that they were North African people who migrated from the green Sahara into the Middle East and played a role in spreading farming into the region however contrary evidence points to the Fertile Crescent as the origin of the first farming another genetic analysis in 2013 suggested a potential Association of the Sumerians with the Indus Valley Civilization that is the civilization in India our modernday India hinding at Indus Mesopotamia relations some Scholars link these samarians to the hurrians and uraan proposing the caucuses as their Homeland preceding the samarians a group known as the Proto fans or Ubbi adans is theorized to have evolved from the Samara culture in northern Mesopotamia the uans are believed to be the first civilizing force in Sumer engaging in activities such as draining marshes for agriculture developing trade and establishing various Industries the origin of the Samarian language is a topic of debate among Scholars some argue for a Proto euphan or substrate language While others propose that Samarian may have been spoken by hunting and fishing communities in the marsh lands and Eastern Arabia one researcher Juris Zarin suggests that these samarians lived along the coast of Eastern Arabia the present day Persian Gulf region before they were driven out by the floods at the end of the Ice Age Sumerian civilization emerged in the urk period that was around the fourth millennium BC with the city of eridu considered one of the oldest representing a fusion of uian farmers Semitic pastoralists and Fisher folk from the marshlands potentially also the ancestors of the samarians historical records become more reliable starting with the early dynastic period the samarians eventually yielded control to semetic States from the Northwest and the Acadian Empire a Semitic speaking power conquered Suma around 2270 BC although Suma was briefly ruled by native samarians during the third dynasty of er which was around 2100 to 2,000 BC the Acadian language persisted as a sacred language city states in Mesopotamia in the late fourth millennium BC suur was characterized by the presence of independent city states each centered around a Temple dedicated to a specific Patron god or goddess these city states were ruled by Priestly Governors called NY or Kings called Lugal remember those terms they'll be important later we have Governors eny and Kings Lugal both of these Priestly Governors and kings were closely associated with religious rights the cities were divided by canals and marked by boundary stones and now I'll list some of the more significant sites the first five cities believed to have been exercised predynastic kingship Before the Flood those being eridu bad tiira which is probably modern day till almadine larak sear and shu Park among these were many other principal cities such as Uruk Kish Ur nippur lagash and so on there were several minor cities as well such as kuara zabala kisura marad dbat borba Kua dur and Asana the last one nagar perhaps is modern day Tel Barak these cities were located in the Euphrates Tigris aluvial plane south of Baghdad in the present day governance of Iraq such as babil diala wasid diar Basra al- mutana and Al Casia kadesia I beg you pardon my Arabic is not as good as it should be should it be good lower your expectations perhaps the Sumerian city states gained prominance during the prehistoric ubed and Uruk periods although Samarian written history dates back to the 27th century BC and earlier the historical record becomes clearer during the early dynastic 3D period around the 23rd Century BC this period marks a time when the language of written records becomes more decipherable enabling archaeologists to read contemporary inscriptions and Records the Acadian Empire emerging in the 23rd Century BC was the first successful state to unite larger regions of Mesopotamia following the guian period the ear3 kingdom also achieved unity in northern and southern Mesopotamia but succumbed to Amorite incursions at the beginning of the second millennium BC the Amorite dynasty of enin persisted until around 1700 BC when Mesopotamia was ultimately United under under Babylonian rule the ubad period is characterized by a distinctive style of high quality painted potery that spread across Mesopotamia and the Persian Gulf while the oldest evidence for occupation is found at T L OA ly it is likely that older sites exist but remain as to this day undes discovered given the favorable environmental conditions for human habitation in southern Mesopotamia prior to the ubad period this culture appears to have originated from the Samaran culture in northern Mesopotamia however it remains unclear whether these people were the actual Sumerians associated with later urk culture The Narrative of the transmission of civilization gifts to inana the goddess of Uruk by en the god of wisdom and the chief deity of eridu May reflect the transition from eridu to ur the transition from the ubad period to the Uruk period is archaeologically marked by a gradual shift from domestically produced painted Pottery on a slow wheel to a diverse range of unpainted Pottery mass produced by Specialists on fast wheels the Uruk period is essentially a continuation and expansion of the ubed period with Pottery being the primary visible change during the Uruk period around 4100 to 2900 BC extensive trade networks facilitated the emergence of large stratisfied Temple centered cities with populations exceeding 10,000 people centralized administrations in these cities employed specialized workers it is likely that during this period Sumerian cities began utilizing slave labor with evidence of captured slaves working in various capacities well that's not very nice isn't it they shouldn't be doing that artifacts and colonies of the Uruk civilization have been discovered across a wide geographical area spanning from from the tus mountains in Turkey to the Mediterranean Sea in the west and Western Iran in the East the Uruk civilization disseminated by Sumerian Traders and colonists such as those found at Tel Barak influence the surrounding cultures leading to the gradual development of comparable and competing economies and cultures among the neighboring peoples Samarian cities however were unable to sustain remote longdistance colonies through military force during the urk period Samarian cities likely operated Theocratic with a priest king remember that word that's right NC at the head Helm supported by a Council of Elders that included both men and women this political structure may have influenced the later Sumerian Pantheon organized Warfare and professional soldiers were not prevalent during this area and towns were generally left unwalled urak in particular had became the world's most urbanized City during this time boasting a city a rather boasting a population of other 50,000 inhabitants which was a remarkable figure for the period the ancient Sumerian king list details the early dynasties of several prominent cities from the urk period the initial section of the list me mentions Kings who portly ruled before a significant flood with some names possibly being fictional or featuring legendary mythological features like alulim and Dumis the conclusion of the Uruk period aligned with the peora oscal a dry period occurring from 3200 to 2900 BC it marked the conclusion of an extended wetter and warmer climate phase known as the Hollow Scene climatic Optimum spanning approximately 9,000 to 5,000 years ago early dynastic period the dynastic period commenced around 2900 BC and marked a trans transition from Temple Centric administration led by the Council of Elders Guided by the NC to a more secular government headed by a Lugal legendary patriarchal figures such as dumuzid Lugal Banda and Gilgamesh emerged during this period ruling shortly before the historical record began around 900 BC coinciding with the development of syllabic writing from early pictograms while rulers expanded into neighboring areas the center of Sumerian culture remained in southern Mesopotamia influencing the neighboring citic groups itan the 13th King of the first dynasty of Kish is the earliest dynastic King on the Samaran King list whose name is known from other legendary sources the earliest King validated through archaeological evidence is enme baragi of Kish also mentioned in the Epic of Gilgamesh this raises the possibility that Gilgamesh might have been a historical King of UR the Epic of Gilgamesh indicates an eror associated with increased Warfare leading to the fortification and expansion of cities with wall defenses and larger sizes as undefended villagers in southern Mesopotamia simply began to vanish both en Mera and gilgames are credited with building the walls of Uruk the first dynasty of lagash the dynasty of lagash flourishing from around 2500 to 2270 BC although absent from the King list is a well documented through significant monuments and numerous archaeological discoveries a atum of lagash during his brief Ru established one of the earliest known empires in history he annexed almost all of sume incorporating cities like Kish Ur urk and Larsa and imposed tribute on Umar the Rival city state of lagash a atom's territorial influence extended to parts of Elum along to the Persian Gulf notably he employed Terror as a strategic tool as depicted in his Stell of the vultures which illustrates vultures pecking at the severed heads and other body parts of his enemies unfortunately for anatum his Empire collapsed shortly after his death subsequently Lugal zagi the priest king of Umar seized power from the lagash dynasty he conquered UK establishing it as his capital and proclaimed an Empire that stretched from the Persian Gulf to the Mediterranean Lugal zag SE was the final ethnically Sumerian king before the rise of Sargon of aad which brings us to the Acadian Empire where things in Mesopotamia begin to get a little busy the Acadian Empire existing from approximately 2234 to 2154 BC was established by sagon of aard the Eastern Semitic Acadian language is first evident in the proper names of the kings of Kish around 2800 BC which are preserved in the later King lists texts written entirely in Old Acadian date back to around 2500 BC with its usage reaching its Zenith during the rule of Sargon the Great however even during this period most administrative tablets can continued to be written in Sumerian the language of the scribes Scholars distinguished three stages of old Acadian the pre sargonic era the aradian Empire Era and the subsequent er3 period Acadian and Sumerian coexisted as vernacular languages for about a millennium but around 1800 BC Samaran was evolving into a more literary language known primary to Scholars and scribes thorkill Jacobson has argued for little historical disruption between the pre and post sagon periods emphasizing that too much emphasis has been placed on the perception of a Semitic versus Sumerian conflict nevertheless it is established that Acadian was briefly imposed on parts of Elam that were previously conquered by sagon after the fall of the Acadian Empire to the guian guda of lagash a native Samarian ruler gained local prominence he continued the traditions of the saronic king's claim to Divinity guda along with his successors from the lagash dynasty played a significant role in promoting artistic development and left behind a substantial number of archaeological artifacts the third dynasty of er led by ER namu and Shuli which was around 2112 to 2004 BC in the m middle chronology has been incorrectly referred to as a Sumerian Renaissance during this period the region underwent a transformation becoming more Semitic rather than more Sumerian Acadian speaking semites experienced a Resurgence in Assyria and waves of Semitic Maru or amorites founded various local powers in the South including isin Larsa Asuna and later the much more wellknown Babylonia Babylonian Empire emerging from these developments briefly dominated the southern Mesopotamian region mirroring the earlier dominance of the old Assyrian Empire in the North during the late 21st century BC despite these changes however the Samarian language persisted as a sacerdotal language taught in schools in Babylonia and Assyria kind of like the use of Latin in the medieval period as long as the uh Kon writing continued to be employed during this period there was a significant population shift from southern Mesopotamia to the north ecologically the agricultural productivity of Sumerian lands suffered due to increasing salinity a long recognized problem the same thing happened to many cities in the Indus Valley Civilization which we will get to in a different video I'm sure you're looking forward to that poorly drained irrigated soil combined with high evaporation rates in the arid climate led to the accumulation of dissolved salts severely reducing agricultural yields despite attempts to shift from wheat to more salt tolerant barley the decline in population in the region estimated to be nearly 3 fifths from 2100 to 1700 BC and this kind of drop certainly upet the balance of power this weakened areas where Samaran was spoken and strengthened regions where Acadian dominated as a result Samarian persisted solely as a liter literary and lurgical language similar to Latin in our modern times modern being pre-industrial Revolution at least after an elamite invasion and the sack of er during the rule of iby sin suur fell under Amorite rule marking the beginning of the middle Bronze Age The Independent Amorite states of the 20th to 18th centuries are summarized as the dynasty of isin in the Samaran King list ultimately leading to the rise of Babylonia under hamurabi around 1800 Beast C later rulers who dominated Assyria and Babylonia occasionally assumed the old saronic title of king of Sumer and akard as seen in the tuul NTA first of Assyria after 1225 BC urk One of summa's largest cities is estimated to have a population of 50 to 80,000 at its height taking into account the population of other Samarian cities and the large agricultural population a rough estimate for sumer's overall population ranges from 800,000 to 1.5 million now to put that in a bit of perspective for you the world population in total at that time had been estimated at around 27 million so that was a lot of people in a comparatively small area the Samarian spoke a language isolate and while some linguists have suggested the presence of a substrate language beneath Samaran the archaeological record indicates uninterrupted culture continuity from the early uad period settlements in southern Mesopotamia the Samarian people who settled in the region engaged in agriculture benefiting from the fertile lands created by Silk deposits of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers there are different theories about the origins of the samarians some archa archaeologists propos that the original speakers of ancient Samaran may have been farmers who migrated from the north of Mesopotamia after developing irrigation agriculture there the pottery of thead period in southern Mesopotamia has been linked to the Samara period culture in the north known for practicing A Primitive form of irrigation agriculture along the Middle tigis River and its tributaries according to this Theory farming communities moved into southern Mesopotamia equipped with a temple centered social Organization for mobilizing labor and technology for water control allowing them to thrive in the challenging environment another perspective suggests a continuity of Sumerians from the indigenous hunter fisher fol Traditions associated with bifacial assemblages found in the Arabian literal jurus Zarin proposes that the samarians may have been the people living in the Persian Gulf region right before that flood as we apore mentioned but this is yet to be proven and now we can talk a little bit about the Samarian culture may I remind you that if you're still watching at this point while I hope you're enjoying I also equally hope that you would support the channel by liking this video and subscribing and perhaps leaving your comments below if you don't feel inclined to like And subscribe then make sure you have a good experience watching the video regardless so let us continue now to the Samarian culture and all of its fascinating eccentricities in the early Samaran period various aspects of daily life and material culture are reflected in primitive pictograms providing insights into the civilization Pottery abundant and diverse with different forms of vases bowls and dishes special jars were crafted for honey butter oil and possibly date wine some vases had pointed feet While others were flat bottomed and set on frames oil jars and likely others were sealed with Clay similar to the style of the early Egyptians Furniture beds stools and chair chairs were in use and all of these featured carved legs resembling those of oxes and sometimes other animals fireplaces and fire altars were also a part of domestic life with many Samaran houses featuring them in prominent places people wore feathered headdresses as well a defining characteristic of Sumerian fashion much of the old Sumerian artworks that we find represent some people wearing such a headdress various tools were also known including knives drills wedges and Sor like instruments while of course Spears bows arrows and daggers were utilized in Warfare interestingly enough we don't have any record of the samarians using swords H curious in terms of writing clay tablets were used for taking down notes indicating an early form of record keeping and communication of course much of our records that we have from earlier times are rather simple and come in the form of tax receipts and trade records later times though provide us with certain religious writings and even some cultural Insight Tim keeping time was reckoned in lunar months reflecting an early system of time measurement based on the moon this is of course how many Societies in those days would measure time as it was more relevant for agricultural needs notably many countries around the world still have lunar calendars that they use in conjunction with the Gregorian calendar such as the Chinese who still use their old calendar which means everybody gets two birthdays how lucky music there is evidence of musical instruments with liars and flutes being played the Liars of er are among the well-known examples of musical artifacts from this period do look them up so these details provide a bit of a glimpse into daily life technology and cultural practices of the early Sumerians showcasing their skills in various crafts and Technologies so we may imagine samarians as a family sitting around with their fireplace on their chairs with carved Ox legs playing their flutes and liars and enjoying their time with each other much like any other Society modern or ancient does while we still have the pleasure to do so in Samarian Society the institution of marriage was formalized through specific customs and practices one of these was arranged marriages and most marriages were typically arranged by the parents of the bride and the groom the practice involved the families negotiating and agreeing upon the union and you'd be surprised how much that still happens in the modern day engagements and marriages were often sealed on written contracts record Ed on those clay tablets that we had affer mentioned these documents outlined the terms and conditions of the marriage agreement providing a legal basis for the union marriages became legally binding as soon as the groom delivered a bridal gift to the bride's father the gift was a symbolic gesture and a form of acknowledgment by the groom the samarians placed an importance on procreation and family life a proverb is cited highlighting the detail happy marriage where a husband boasts about his wife bearing him eight sons and expressing his ongoing desire for fun under the sheets now samarians just like everybody else enjoyed that but just like many societies there was a discouragement of premarital sex Samarian Society generally discouraged that the concept of virginity did not have equivalent in Sumerian or a Cadian but terms such as deflowered were used descriptively and same as the opposite unde flowered the in intactness of the Hyman was less relevant in assessing a woman's virginity compared to later cultures virginity was expressed through descriptive terms such as labat meaning the upper mentioned and deflowered or the rather humorous gunza which indicated never having known a penis well that's a creative term for it these terms reflected the cultural emphasis on a woman's sexual Purity the assessments of virginity assessments of virginity relied on the woman's own account rather than strict physical criteria terms like the E2 in Acadian medical texts may have referred to the Hyman but the intactness of the Hyman was not the sole determinant of a woman's virginity these customs and attitude towards marriage and sexual practices were integral to Samarian societal norms and reflected their cultural values and beliefs the samarians exhibited open and permissive attitudes towards sexuality as reflected in various aspects of their cultural practice IES ritual Purity surian sexual mores were not primarily concerned with the moral implications of sexual acts but rather whether such acts made an individual ritually unclean of course the gods can see everything can't they ritual Purity and cleanliness played a significant role in their societal norms the samarians also widely believe that masturbation had a positive impact on sexual potency for both men and women and so masturbation was a common practice engaged both individually and with Partners I'm not exactly sure how they got the primary source on that but we are just going to have to take their word for it and to priestesses who were dedicated to serving in temples were forbidden from producing Offspring and they had a clever way of getting around the rule by taking the backwards route which I will not explain more this practice likely served to fulfill their religious roles while avoiding pregnancy and satisfying other carnal needs and in terms of prostitution of course that existed in Samarian society as well but the status of sacred prostitution is not entirely clear now perhaps some eybrows have raised sacred prostitution what on Earth is that well the term sacred prostitution has been used to describe a form of ritualized sex work associated with religious practices but the evidence for its existence in suur is not conclusive these aspects of Sumerian sexual attitudes and practices were shaped by a combination of cultural religious and practical considerations the emphasis on ritual Purity and the acceptance of a variety of sexual practices highlight the unique characteristics of Samarian views on sexuality within the context of their historical and cultural milu and now for some words on agriculture and hunting the transition to agriculture by the samarians likely occurred around 5,000 to 4500 BC marked by the adoption of core agricultural practices these included organized irrigation large scale cultivation using plow Agriculture monocropping and the establishment of an agricultural labor force under bureaucratic control the need to manage Temple accounts within this organized structure played a pivotal role in the development of writing which emerged around 3500 BC in the early Sumerian Uruk period primitive pictograms suggest the domestication of sheep goats cattle and pigs the samarians utilized oxen as their primary beasts of burden and relied on donkeys or equids for transportation they crafted Woolen clothing and rugs from the animals wool or hair housers also often had inclosed Gardens with various trees plants including wheat and other cereals grown in fields the shadu an irrigation tool was already in use by this period and plants were cultivated in pots or vases the Sumerians you may be surprised were actually Pioneers in beer consumption cultivating cereals such as wheat barley and mixed grains for brewing beer held cultural significance and was celebrated as well in the egic of gilgames where enidu joyfully partakes in the local custom and a quote from the Epic drink the beer as is the custom of the land and he drank the beer seven jugs of it and became expansive and sang with joy well that sounds fun doesn't it Sumerian agriculture dependent on irrigation mired Egyptian practices urbanization linked to irrigation involved 89% of the population residing in cities according to Anthropologist Robert mccomic Adams they cultivated a variety of crops including barley chickpeas lentils wheat onions lettuce mustard leaks and many more fishing and hunting fowl and gazelle of course complemented their diet quite well irrigation methods featured shads canals dikes rears and reservoirs frequent tigis and Euphrates river floods necess ated Canal maintenance and silt removal with the wealthy often exempt from labor so we're not so different after all the saman Farmers Almanac outlined post flood season rituals including flooding and draining Fields oxen stomping weed elimination and meticulous plowing harrowing and raking before planting evaporation induced salinity concerns led to a shift from wheat to barley in the ear3 period as we mentioned before barley is a more salt-resistant crop harvesting in Spring involved three person teams for reaping binding and sheath handling threshing wagons driven by oxen separated serial heads from stalks with threshing sleds further extracting Gra winnowing the Grain and chaff mixture completed the progress and now let's talk about some Sumerian technology you may be surprised what they came up with although back in those days there wasn't much to do but to uh sit around and think about ways to improve your situation after a long day of farming or toiling on some Monument the samarians were innovators in various Technologies contributing significantly to human progress notable examples include the wheel to which the samarians are accredited with developing a fundamental invention that revolutionized not just Transportation but many aspects of Life they also created one of the world's earliest known writing systems cona form and record much information on their clay tablets samarians Advanced mathematical knowledge particularly arithmetic and geometry in response to their agricultural needs they also advised sophisticated irrigation systems to manage Water Resources they were pretty good at building boats as well after all they had those two rivers beside them to think about we had to get up up and down them somehow and they utilize them for trade between different cities much like the Nile was utilized so they constructed different types of boats including clinker built sailboats and skin boats made from animal skins and Reeds and of course they had wooden or ships too the Luna solar C calendar samarians developed a calendar based on the cycles of the Moon and the Sun that calendar also went on to influence subsequent calendrical systems bronze technology samarians were adept at working with bronze using it for various tools and weapons they were also Masters At The Art of leather working creating functional items like water skins and bags and it wasn't just the leather they were great with metal tools including SWS chisels hammers braces bits nails and even pins of course if you're working with metal you're going to eventually make weapons such as Lance points arrow heads and daggers and actually the samarians managed to develop glue as well an adhesive substance that they use in various applic ations and contexts they created functional items like harnesses armor boots and sandals through their Advanced textile techniques samarians innovated the military technology of the time designing Quivers and arrows for war chariots perhaps the Hittites that copied some of their ideas they also crafted protective covers and scabbards for blades and swords so you wouldn't be cutting your leg while running into battle samarians were also early Brewers as affer mentioned showcasing their knowledge of fermentation but it really shined with the samarians designed practical items like rings and harpoons hoes and knives for daily use the diverse technological achievements of the samarians reflect their Ingenuity and enduring impact on subsequent civilizations and they must have had quite an impact because we still talk about them today that old interesting civilization that continues to Fascinate with its Mysteries and eccentricities well I hope that you managed to learn a few things today I know that during my research of this particular topic I learned some new things as well and expanded my knowledge on the samarians quite greatly I'd like to remind you again if you enjoy the Channel please like And subscribe I'm a new guy here on YouTube and I'm trying to do the best I can to bring you the most relevant content to your specific desires so I'll wish you once more good night and sweet dreams hello and welcome back I hope you're feeling comfortable you found a nice spot to relax because today I'm going to talk about something very interesting that interesting topic being the seven wonders of the ancient world so if you would join me now I invite you to close your eyes and let me take you back thousands of years and we can learn together about these brilliant places confined to the pages of history let us now begin with the Great Pyramid of Giza the Great Pyramid of Giza is the oldest and largest of the three pyramids on the Giza plateau in Egypt it was built as a tomb for Pharaoh kufu around 2,560 BC and it stands at an impressive height of 146 M or 481 ft the precise construction of the pyramid is astounding the base is leveled to within a few cm and the sides of the pyramid are aligned to the cardinal points north south east and west with an accuracy of almost perfect orientation the Great Pyramid has three main Chambers ERS then being the king's chamber the Queen's chamber and an unfinished chamber at a lower Subterranean level the purpose and significance of these Chambers Remain the subject of much debate among Scholars and egyptologists the mortar used in the constru construction of the Great Pyramid is subject of Fascination its composition is not fully understood and it has proven to be extremely durable holding the massive Stones together for thousands of years originally the Great Pyramid was covered with smooth white Tura Limestone casing stones reflecting sunlight and making the pyramid shine most of these casing stones have been removed over time revealing the rough core of the structure so what you see today is the Insight of the pyramid as its former glory has been long Stripped Away the Great Pyramid has a a series of passages and corridors including the grand Gallery along ascending Corridor with a Corell ceiling the purpose of these features is not entirely clear adding to the Mystique of the pyramid now the original pyramid is believed to have had a cap Stone made of gold or electrum a naturally occurring Ally of golden silver however the Capstone is now missing and its exact design and purpose are speculative some theories propose that the layout of the pyramids at Giza they're aligned with the three stars of Orion's Belt creating a Celestial Connection in the design of the complex the construction of the Great Pyramid likely involved a vast labor force including skilled workers engineers and laborers the methods used to transport and lift the massive Stones do still remain a topic of research and discussion the the Great Pyramid is an enduring symbol of Egyptian civilization and testament to the architectural and Engineering prowess of the time it continues to capture the imagination of people worldwide and now for our second wonder of the ancient world one that is perhaps a little less welln know but equally as interesting and that is the Hanging Gardens of Babylon the existence however of the Hanging Gardens of Babylon is debated among historians now while they are listed as one of the Seven Wonders some Scholars argue that there is limited evidence to support their actual Construction according to historical accounts the gardens that were supposedly built by King Nebuchadnezzar II for his wife amius of media who missed the Green Hills and Valleys of her homelands the uniqueness of the Hanging Gardens lay in their teered structure featuring plants and trees at different levels It is believed that an advanced system of irrigation possibly a series of water wheels was used to lift water to the elevated Terraces the Babylonians were known for their Advanced engineering skills including the construction of impressive structures like the Ishtar gate the Hanging Gardens if they did did indeed exist would have been just another Testament to their architectural prowess the exact location of the Hanging Gardens remains uncertain with some suggesting that they were indeed in Babylon which is modernday Iraq While others propose they may have been in an area called ninev also in modern day Iraq but different Kingdoms in the ancient times the Hanging Gardens were described as a lush Paradise in the midst of the Arid Mesopotamian landscape providing shade and Greenery in a desert environment historical accounts suggest that aqueducts may have been used to transport water from the Euphrates River rer to the gardens themselves ensuring a continuous water supply for the many plants that were there the gardens were said to be constructed in a series of terraces each one supported by the one below this design allowed for a cascading effect creating the illusion of plants hanging from above the Hanging Gardens whether real or legendary have become a symbol of human Ingenuity and the desire to create Beauty in an unexpected place even in the heart of a bustling City the primary historical sources describing the Hanging Gardens come from Greek historians like strabo and filo of B antium who wrote about them several centuries after their supposed existence this fact has added an element of mystery but also skepticism to the story we're not sure if the Hanging Gardens ever existed and perhaps we'll never know but much like many other things in the ancient world leaving it up to imagination maybe the better choice and now for the statue of Zeus at Olympia the statue of Zeus at Olympia created by the renowned ancient Greek sculptor fidus was a colossal Masterpiece it stood about 13 M or 43 ft tall and it was made of both Ivory and goldplated bronze the statue was located in the Temple of Zeus at Olympia Greece it was constructed around 432 BC and was considered one of the Seven Wonders due to its artistic and Engineering Excellence Zeus the king of the the Gods in Greek mythology was depicted sitting on a throne holding a scepter in one hand and a small statue of Nike the goddess of victory in the other the statue was a representation of divine power and Majesty the use of gold and ivory in the statues construction was a symbol of wealth and luxury of course the gold exterior shimmered in the sunlight adding to the a inspiring presence of the statue unfortunately the original Statue no longer exists is believed to have been destroyed or lost during the decline of the ancient world and only descriptions and representations on coins and in writings provide glimpses of its magnificence the statue was a focal point for religious ceremonies and games held in Olympia including of course the ancient Olympic Games Pilgrims from various Greek city states traveled to Olympia to witness the statue and to participate in these events of course fius the sculptor established a Workshop near the Temple of Zeus to create the statue he was also responsible for the design and construction of the giant crystala fantin a statue of Athena paranos in the paron of Athens the statue served as a symbol of unity among the Greek city states as the Olympic Games bought people together for peaceful competition and religious observances the Throne of Zeus was adorned with various mythological scenes and sculptures depicting the Triumph of Zeus are the Titans and other legendary Tales from Greek mythology fases contributions to the ancient Greek Arts extended beyond the statue of Zeus his influence is seen in other sculptures and Architectural elements leaving an enduring Legacy in the history of classical art and now for the Temple of emus at Ephesus Ephesus Turkey the Temple of emus was located in Ephesus an ancient Greek city in present day Turkey it was dedicated to artamus the Greek goddess of the hunt Wilderness and fertility the temple went through multiple reconstructions with the final version being completed around 550 BC it was designed by the architect keron and his son metanis with contributions from other sculps and Architects the Temple of artamus was one of the largest Greek temples ever built with dimensions of approximately 115 by 55 M its Grandeur and Architectural Beauty contributed to its in illusion within the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World the temple was primarily constructed using marble contributing to its aesthetic appeal the exterior was adorned with intricate sculptures and reliefs chating the artistic skill of those ancient Craftsmen the temple complex known as the emision served not only as a religious site but also as a cultural and economic Hub it housed numerous works of art and attracted pilgrims and Merchants from across the Mediterranean in 356 BC the temple was destroyed by arson orchestrated by a man named herostratus who sought Fame by destroying the renowned structure the Ephesians subsequently decreed that his name should never be mentioned however historical records have preserved it Alexander the Great I'm sure you know him offered Finance to the Reconstruction of the temple but imposed a condition that the new structure should surpass all others in Grandeur ultimately the construction did not however match the original Splendor as what could the temple housed a cult statue of emus likely crafted by the sculptor endos the goddess was depicted adorned with multiple breasts symbolizing fertility and abundance Artemus as worshiped at Ephesus represented a powerful and independent deity reflecting the significance of female deities in ancient Greek religion despite its destruction and incomplete reconstructions the Temple of emus left a lasting impact on architecture and art elements of its design and decoration influenced subsequent structures in the ancient world and as for our next wonder of the ancient world I now invite you to explore the mosum at halicarnassus the mosum at halicarnassus was commissioned by emisia II in memory of her husband mosus the satra or governor of karia after his death in 353 BC now that term mosum has since become synonymous with grand tombs so that's where that word comes from old morsus the construction of the melum involved the collaboration of four Greek schol sculptors leoars briois scopas and timotheus and the architect pthos each contributed to different aspects of the structure the mosum was renowned for its innovative and unique design blending elements of various architectural styles it featured a series of terraces a colonade of Ionic and Corinthian columns and a stepped pyramid crowned by a chariot statue the exterior of the mosum was adorned with numerous sculptures and reliefs depicting famous scenes from Greek mythology battles of the past and even the mundane banalities of daily life this extensive decorative program highlighted the craftsmanship of the artists involved they were all very good at their jobs the mosum stood at an impressive height of around 45 M or 148 ft and had a base measuring about 32x 38 M 105x 125 ft its dimensions and scale contributed to its status as one of the Seven Wonders halakar nasus the city where the mosum was built which is near modernday Bodrum turkey was a Melting Pot of different cultures the mosum reflected this diversity in its architecture incorporating Greek Egyptian and leian influences at the Pinnacle of the mosum stood a colossal statue of morosus and a chariot created by the sculptor Pius this statue served as a prominent landmark in the city the mosum and halicarnassus faced damage from earthquakes in the later centuries the Knights of St John who occupied the region during the medieval period used some of the ruins to fortify their Castle however in the 19th century British archaeologists Charles Newton and CT Newton conducted excavations at the site uncovering various fragments and sculptures some of these artifacts are now displayed at the British museum the term mosum has come to represent any Grand tomb emphasizing the enduring Legacy of the mosle helicar nessus on the field of monumental architecture and ferary art and now for a more wellknown wonder of the ancient world we now arrive at the Colossus of Roads the Colossus of RADS was an enormous bronze statue of the son God Helios erected at the entrance of the harbor of Roads a Greek island around 280 BC it was designed to serve as a guardian and symbol of the city's strength the statue was crafted by the sculptor chares of lindos who spent 12 years creating the Marvel it stood about 33 M or 138 ft tall making it one of the tallest statues in the ancient world the Colossus was constructed using bronze plates over an iron framework to prevent corrosion the outer layer was coated with a thin layer of bronze this bronze gave it a rather stunning Glee meing appearance that could be seen from a long way away the Colossus unfortunately stood for only 56 years before it was toppled by an earthquake in 226 BC the statues snapped at the knees and fell onto the land despite its destruction it remained a symbol of Roads after its collapse the Colossus lay on the ground for nearly 900 years according to historical accounts it was still a breathtaking sight with people coming from AAR and all sorts of places to Marvel at its massive fragments contrary to some popular depictions historical evidence suggests that the coloss did not straddle the harbor entrance instead it likely Stood Beside the harbor welcoming the ships in with its colossal presence the construction of the Colossus was financed through the sale of equipment left by the defeated Macedonian army after the siege of Roads the statue symbolize the UN and resilience of the rodians in the face of great adversary ancient Travelers including plenny the Elder marveled at the Colossus plenny praised its artistic and Engineering achievements highlighting its intricate details and the skills of its creator after lying on the ground for centuries the remains of the Colossus were eventually sold as Scrap Metal by the Arab conquerors who invaded roads in 654 CE the metal of course fetched a rather substantial sum hope it was worth it the Colossus of Roads has l a lasting impact on Art and popular culture it inspired various artistic representations including poems paintings sculptures and its image continues to Captivate the imagination to this very day and now for our final entry in the seven wonders of the ancient world can you guess what it is it's the Lighthouse of Alexandria the Lighthouse of Alexandria was built on the small island of faros near the city of Alexandria in Egypt it was constructed during the reign of toomy II philadelphus in the 3r century BC the lighthouse was a Marvel of ancient engineering combining practicality with artistic design it stood in an estimated 100 to 130 M as 330 to 430 ft and featured three tiers a square base a cylindrical Tower and a circular Beacon the Greek architect sostratus of nidus is credited with the design and construction of the lighthouse his name was initially inscribed on the structure but it was later covered by a dedication to tmy II the primary function of the lighthouse was to guide Sailors safely into the busy Harbor of Alexandria its light source likely an open flame or a series of controlled fires could be seen from great distances away the Lighthouse of Alexandria is said to have used a sophisticated mirror
