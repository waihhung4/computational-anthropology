"foreign [Music] who are we where did we come from how did we come to be these are questions that human beings have asked since we acquired the facility to ask questions and across Millennia text both secular and sacred have recorded our various Journeys in search of answers Century those Journeys took a sharp turn as Thomas Henry Huxley leveraged Darwin's theory of evolution to argue that if new species of animals could evolve from earlier species than so could humans a new discipline emerged paleo empropology the scientific study of human Origins combining insights from archeology anthropology and the fossil record which throughout the 20th century convincingly demonstrated that human beings did indeed evolve from earlier ancestors more recently analyzes of the human genome have further revolutionized our understanding of human Origins there is now strong evidence that our species Homo sapiens shared planet Earth with a number of other species of early humans and that we all got along fairly friendly as many of us carry DNA from some of those species so what set us apart from those other human species and why did we Prevail perhaps our ability to think abstractly made the difference we create art for pleasure we use symbols to communicate information and ideas we develop rituals that create cohesion and identity within a community and that level of abstract reasoning is a profound part of what defines us that's what makes us human but new research is challenging this perspective by raising the tantalizing possibility that we may not be as different as we once thought because some of the other early human species may have also had creative and Abstract faculties findings that may well be rewriting the story of humankind [Music] foreign [Music] thank you you know when we try to answer some of those questions questions that really speak to who we are how we fit in to a grand story a grand narrative issues of origin prove to be these powerful anchors of our understanding at least in part that's why many of us are consumed with trying to understand the Big Bang the origin of the universe the origin of it all we are driven to understand the origin of galaxies and stars and planets we want to know the origin of life we want to know where intelligence comes from and as we pass through the lineages we want to know where our genus came from where our species has come from and this is a journey as briefly noted in that piece that we have vigorously pursued for some time and our guest here today is one of the leading Lights of the field Our Guest is Lee Berger a name who many of you are deeply familiar with who has made some of the real great discoveries in trying to further our understanding of those deep questions he is the chair of the Paleo anthropology department at the University of it waters run in Johannesburg South Africa he has had wonderful series on National Geographic Nova and he is here today to give us a sense of where we are in this Grand Quest and the wonderful thing about Lee is not only is he one of the Prime movers in our evolving understanding of our own Evolution he's also one of the great narrators of science one of the great storytellers that speaks to this journey that we humans have been on to try to understand ourselves and so it really does give me great pleasure to Welcome to the stage Lee Berger thank you thank you everyone thank you Brian thank you all right so in our our discussion today it'd be great to get caught up on the rapidly moving field of understanding human Origins but before we get to that particular story which speaks to all of us if you don't mind I'd like to spend a little bit time on your individual story because look I mean part of the reason we have these conversations is you know you want to inspire the Next Generation so that they can get a sense of you know what it takes to be somebody who really changes our understanding in the way that you and your colleagues have so very beginning you you you're you were born in in Georgia is that correct I was born I wasn't born in Georgia I was born in Kansas Georgia is sort of the rural South and hillow Brisbane it's great to be here I I was a kid that grew up in sort of this idyllic rural area you know I would spend my Summers fishing and running through the woods and like Dorothy like without the dress mostly yeah and I would that was fascinating as a child with you know Native American artifacts which appear from plowed fields and geology my my grandfather was a uh a frustrated oil Wildcatter you know one of those guys missing fingers from the chains and you know had pet chimpanzees and drove a Cadillac and my father grew up in the back of a slipstream trailer in the Texas and Oklahoma regions and um so there was this deep Fascination but that wasn't the pathway they ended up they were middle class family my mother was a math teacher my father sold real estate insurance and I was a bright kid in a rural community and in that time there was kind of only a few places that a bright kid could go like that and and I think it's probably a lot like rural areas everywhere in the world you were going to be a doctor a lawyer an engineer an accountant and maybe particular to the south of America a preacher and one of those would become a politician sometime or something like that um so I would you know I had to give a scholarship I got Naval scholarship went to University at pre-law um and hated every moment really except I got to take electives I got to take electives in geology and Archeology and for the first time in my life which I really didn't even Envision those as a career you know they weren't in front of me as a way to a pathway I saw people who absolutely adored what they did I also found out that all that time spent exploring as a kid was valuable in finding fossils I had a knack for it I could go with a field trip and see the fossils they were looking for and find them and I I became one of these funny things of of failing all my main courses literally F's and D's you know on that is that really true that's true and making Straight A's in all my electives and I ended up in front of this naval officer you know he was my academic officer and one of the horrible things was at that time if you'd accepted one of these officer scholarships you'd have to pay is that really true pay it back if you fail out and you go enlisted to do that in Vanderbilt where I was very expensive school it's been many many years in the Navy and so I'm standing there at attention you got to imagine this you know I'm in my you know these sort of Top Gun whites standing there at attention in front of this officer that's my life in his hands my attention and he's he's got this paper on his desk which is my transcript which is embarrassing because there's lots of fs and D's on it you know and he says Burger Lieutenant Ron strikes by the way Naval aviator and he said Burger he says what do you see here and he pushes it across with one finger and I remember going something like you know failure sir you know something dramatic like that he said I don't see that he says I see a young man and hasn't found what he loves he said if you promise me this you will quit the university right now go find what you love and then come back and he pointed to the geology and archeology I'll let you out I'll sign your release papers with Noah that's hugely unusual boy you know it was he had it particularly for a naval officer yeah and I said yes and went and found myself and eventually came back to University and it was never work for a second after that you know I'd found this place and that took me on this journey that I was gonna you know I came back and of course I I found paleontology like one does and I find dinosaur paleontology like every young person does and I was going to be a dinosaur paleontologist and I read a book called Lucy sure my Dawn Johansson I'm sure many people have read that and in that and in the discussions that were occurring around that Don had said that there's something like a one in 10 million chance of Discovery in an ancient human relative fossil even if you are in an area where they are known to be and it's in Africa and for some reason that had incredible attractiveness and resonance man maybe I shouldn't be proud of that and maybe I shouldn't even reflect that but it it had you know I was thinking here's a field that even if you make a tiny Discovery you can change I mean at that time it's hard for people I think to imagine at that time in history there were almost certainly more people who studied human Origins and evolution than there were physical objects they studied imagine that imagine a field of science that has more practitioners than it does data it does not make for a pretty field of science I assure you it makes for a very violent possessive scare science that that and and paleoanthropology was every bit of that in the in the late 80s and early enough but there's something really interesting there so you were driven more by The Challenge than necessarily the specific content I mean if it was one in 10 million to find you know a bone of you know a a giraffe or of some ancient sort that might have been the direction that you went absolutely I think to be honest I mean who isn't interested in human Origins right who is an interest in where you come from same reason I bet everyone in this audience has has looked at their genealogy you ever wondered why you do that you do that because you understand that you're in your grandparents great grandparents Those Distant lineages there is meaning and the making of you yeah I just do that people like me just do that in the extreme we're interested in the making of us and so I of course I'm attracted to that it had meaning to me but yeah you know I was up for that challenge I buy lottery tickets too but is that the case I mean I was going to ask you are you I mean Lottery is not much of a risk because there's not much to lose there but are you a risk taker I I am I am I think you'll hear a little bit about that as we go on but I'm not a gambler by the way but I do buy a lottery ticket just because the story of my life has been sort of Lottery level discoveries but you know you guaranteed if you play the lottery enough that you will lose all your money it's virtually guaranteed you're also guaranteed that I just don't find it that interesting you're also guaranteed that if you don't buy a lottery ticket true too you will never win that's true too but that suggests you should buy one ticket because you go from zero odds to infinitely more at all which is still a tiny number but still yeah okay anyway so we won't fixate on um and so you decide to go in that direction what's your next to get to Africa you know this is a closed field and so I ended up making a phone call back in the days when you had to look up phone numbers and a phone book or call an operator found Don Johansson's number in California and I heard he was coming to talk to the Georgia science Teachers Association I called him up got his Bulldog of his secretary I mispronounced his name you know the fact Dr Johansson in she said Johansson you know I was almost in and then got through to him amazing when he took my call and I said you know I live in Georgia I'd like to meet you and we did they took a liking to me and he heard my story and I'd had by then a degree I was in geology and a degree in archeology and anthropology he said you know what I need an assistant going to hold of I Gorge where I'm going to work and uh you can be that assistant this summer I'm made right my life's about to happen go away Scrabble together get money for a a plane ticket I'm on my way in that direction and I get three weeks before he's going he calls up and say he lost his permit he's not going and he did something really strange there which I've you know I I I've inquired but I never got a really truthful explanation to he took the moment to call Richard Leakey which some of you will hear from the great leaky family of Kenya who he knew is holding the Harvard University kubi for field school at the same time and he said there's this young guy and he I've disappointed him we're not going now a lot of people don't know this Don and Richard really didn't like each other very much they were at war with each other it's two of the biggest Fossil Finders of that time for some reason Richard said sure he can come and I went and I found myself in Africa where in Africa uh it could be four Northern Kenya Lake turkana Jade C and on the first day there we arrived at the day before after this just two-day you know Lorry Journey and we get there and I am so excited I cannot sleep I get up at four in the morning I'm the only one up except there's a light at this this tea tent that they have and I walked over there and there I met John Kim and get you was preparing to go out for the day one of Richard's great Fossil Finders he looks at me and you know he sees this enthusiastic kid awake at 4 30 in the morning he said you want to come with me I'm like yeah yeah I do go out and next magical six or seven hours was just where he taught me to see this landscape and see the fossils and understand it and I'm enthralled I have found this thing and on the way back eleven o'clock it it gets hotter than here in Brisbane by the way so you know you know it's terrible and we're walking back 11 o'clock in the morning 100 meters from the uh the Land Rover and I looked down and there's a piece of a femur of a hominid on the ground pick it up first day in Africa first day on the fossil Fields beat the odds so that was one in 10 million right I don't know I don't know if that number's true yeah no no we'll talk about that poetically poetically yeah it was one in 10 million man I was hooked you couldn't have dragged me out of Africa ended up I had applied to phds that's the working degree in this field as you know and I all over the world got into most of the places but I was waiting on I'd gone to Richard then and and Don for advice because I said you know I want to be a Fossil Finder and they said you're not working in East Africa they said that to me just like that meaning no place for a young American guy in that landscape they were too young they were too violent it was all you know partitioned out and both of them gave me the same advice they said go to South Africa this was you got to remember the context of this this is late 1989. they just announced that Mandela was going to be released in February of 1990. and they said you know the Landscapes may be changing they heard that a fellow named Philip Tobias one of the great professors of this field had a vault full of fossils they've been discovered over the last you know 30 40 years but hadn't been described really because of the apartheid government's repression so it's a vault in South Africa in South Africa the University of water surround and I had applied there and so I called from a ticket but hadn't heard from them so I called from a tiki box for those of you don't know what that is it's a it was a pay phone you put the little you know Shillings in and you know he answers on the other side with oh dear boy you know when are you arriving that was my acceptance letter to the University of the waters room and so that's where I went and it was crazy time you can imagine uh 1990 there is Mendoza was released in places well you know but I threw myself into walking the high felt of that area and as I was coming out of this East African mentality of 1 in 10 million yeah there hadn't been a hominid Discovery at a new site in sub-equatorial Africa since 1947 48 not nothing nothing not an East Side there's a lot you know there's a government yeah right a little thing like that right it said you know they didn't particularly like the idea of people searching for the idea of the commonality of all humankind and those other the subject wasn't particularly popular um and but I was looking for a site that had a lot of Bones and found one John called gladysville so I I was given a job by the way way out of my league as a table doctor teaching Anatomy I never taught anatomy in my life but I read well and you're still a doctoral student now yeah a doctoral student and the and then I was teaching this BSC course in an honors course in science which I was teaching the human Origins component of it you can all tell how highly qualified I was for this is the first courses I'd ever taught him in that and um and I so I enlisted them I drafted them as part of the course to come out and work for me at gladysville um under the argument that that's how you learn you know it's practical it was a former slave labor I know but don't tell anyone and 16 days into this first expedition like Michelle Erasmus young women on this course picked up a rock and turned it over and handed me and said is that a tooth they're sticking out this rock is hominid there it is a hominid tooth that's one on the left was the first one the next morning the second one comes out two teeth you guys go really you know I can see them you can hear the you know the the awe in the audience right two teeth those two teeth got me in National Geographic magazine that is that and you know and then I threw myself into this site there I am throwing myself into this site I knew that the next Rock I would turn over would have that half of a mandible of a hominid in it because I mean two teeth in 16 days and I could dine on that at conferences for the rest of my life because at that time in history you could because there's so little that already nothing existed yeah and it did not happen at least not for the first week how about the first 17 years yeah don't go too oh it's not that bad I was having a great career I was doing all the things a scientist does I you know I had discoveries I I had devised an idea that the tong child a Famous Fossil was killed by a bird of prey that started a whole scientific Endeavor itself very proud of I was one of the first scientists very controversial say that early australopithesis means the most primitive of the eight men so to speak had long arms and short legs when we thought they were all human proportioned which got me in a lot of trouble in the in the 1990s but I didn't have that discovery and by the end of the 1990s just on the verge of the 21st century I'd risen to this position I took over Philip tobias's chair he'd retired I was a kid though and you know I began to hear these International conferences here I am in charge of all of this now you know I've never seen someone go so far on two teeth and you know while I was naive I wasn't naive enough to know that was not a compliment that was a sort of uh you know they this field was possessive and it was about a mythology built around the discoverers you almost had to be touched by God if that's not too much to discover these things particular and then it began you know not just these things but good ones you know they started putting a level on it and I went through the worst years of my life in the early 21st century it was terrible because I was becoming the poster child for the idea that that the Age of Exploration was dead that there were no new fossil fields to discover there was even paper published in 2001 by the biggest Fossil Finder of that period you know who I'm talking about who said There will not be any new discoveries that change the way we understand human evolution that there will be no new fossil Fields found and that we should stop training people to be young paleoanthropologists because it is insanity to have a field where there are more people studying this than there are objects they study that kill funding for exploration I mean killed it dead and that's a fairly common kind of Rhythm right in the late 1890s there was a statement in physics that all the fundamental laws have been discovered and All That Remains is to determine this or that constant of nature to the sixth decimal place and then we have special relativity general relativity and quantum mechanics so I suspect you did not take that as the final word on it hurt my wallet yeah my ability to do exports but you're right I mean I knew the history of dinosaur paleontology same thing early 19th century we have it all of course we didn't but it was tough um I'll tell you how tough it was that my University convinced by the external forces of these big discoveries of fossils said you know what we're going to close your exploration unit this is now 2006 2007. and we're going to hire under the convincing of these outside forces University a young person to come in and revolutionize it because the idea was what was getting on the covers of Nature and Science were the where the sort of Imaging the the sort of new technologies that were being applied to fossils so the existing ones just analyzing we were never going to find more and I found myself in this really weird thing I hope none of you ever do in your entire lives of of actually sitting on a committee to replace myself I was like 40 years old in a 40 little old where you resigned to this being the end of this career Channel or I was soul-searching and I ended up I remember the day this all happened next part of the story I was seen at home on my computer and I was doing what I guess old people of Our Generation do when you're absolutely have no idea what your future direction is I was Googling my future you know just trolling the internet saying you know what is a guy who's dedicated game the poster boy of of of failure and exploration what am I going to do next and at that moment I became the singular last human being I am convinced on Earth to discover Google Earth and I the reason it is so stupid is I have been a pioneer as you know Brian in the 90s I'm trying to take technology handheld GPS satellite images and combine them into a way to make discoveries I was convinced there was something there but the satellite images cost ten thousand dollars a sheet the pixelation was terrible the handheld GPS's were terrible and expensive and I had failed at that I had I'd run a three-year National Geographic funded expedition to do it and hadn't really done much at all and um but then I'm sitting here looking at Google Earth I I noticed that little white box up the corner for GPS coordinates and I had like some of the most expensively obtained GPS coordinates ever and I put it in and does this right it doesn't zoom into thing and I started I of course looked if I was you know I looked at my house first I'll admit that see if you're naked by the pool you know that kind of thing and I wasn't and then and then I applied it to these sites and that it didn't land on the sides that I'd met in the 90s and it didn't take me long to Google why it didn't because the U.S government had owned the satellites at that time and put deliberate air into them so they couldn't use for terrorism and that sort of thing and so that with the the sort of uh era that was in the handheld GPS is create a compounding air I would devastate I mean I'd spent I'd wasted three years of my life I'd publish some of that data wasted in the sense that you thought you were looking in one area when it was actually displaced from where I thought I was mapping things and wasn't mapping things I was mapping nonsense hmm that's not good it's not great for your scientific reputation to be you know publishing that kind of nonsense but I quickly learned that I could see the sites on Google Earth that I intended to and I started moving those dots from the wrong place to the right place you could see them through features in the landscape you'll see like you'll see some right there like you see those trees see those little clusters of trees that's the green dots yeah those clusters of trees are marking cave sites and fossil sites there were about 103 known at that point and I started looking and started saying wow if that's a cave site then that looks like a cave site and so out I went to ground truth them out walking in this sort of environment to see whether these were actually I knew they couldn't this was the most explored area on planet Earth for these things there's no way they were and as I started exploring on the very first day out I created this target map if you can imagine printed it out as far away from gladysville as I could get because I you know at 17 years of failure in that spot I knew it better than anyone else I went all the way 30 kilometers away to the edge of these dolomitic limestones the greatest potential for these and on the first day found over 20 new sites went for 103 to 123 one day I was blown away I mean we'd missed it all right in front of us you know and what they look like where you know they were these clusters of trees by sight you mean new caves caves and some fossil sites so there were only let me put that in perspective there were only 17 known fossil sites I'd found four of them back in that 1990 Expedition and then all of a sudden there are more of them and I started going out every day over and over again one after the other one after the other and suddenly every day I was building this map January February March April May June July by then I found over 750 new sites in the most explored area on planet Earth I was like oh my god this is my contribution this is what I will leave the future this almost unlimited potential of Discovery and was it mostly tree clumps as the operative way I'm sure we have an image of tree clumps that's what they look like everyone's excited I can hear the you know the awe in the audience but in that treatment white wild olives white stink Woods clustered together you could see them from space and in those are are often depressions holes in the ground sometimes fossils that have been mined off and they were mining for lime in that area back in the you know late 1900s early 20th century and um eventually I had moved right back into the area of gladysville and I knew there was nothing there to find but I'd gone after a couple of these tree clumps and walked up to actually this one and went to it first in the first rock I turned over had a fossil in it which surprised me because this thing is like 800 meters from where I'd spent 17 years working and I'd miss these fossils I felt like an idiot but I was fossil hunting that day I in cave hunting that day so I just you know took the maps down and then went up anything and found 47 new sites in this one Valley right next to the valley I'd been in for 17 years unsuccessfully uh it bugged me a little bit um yeah yeah I had that reaction too um a tragedy had occurred a couple of weeks before which I hadn't told you about and that is the young man that was going to take over we'd selected to bring in this new technology and stuff I lived in the UK and was killed in a motorcycle accident and we had already hired all the young postdocs bought the equipment and stuff and so one of them a couple of days later came into my office job Kibby and he was a postdoc and he said would I be a supervisor and don't call me heartless I said no you know you're a lab guy I'm a field guy and then I thought about it Mom I said but you know I just found this site I've just found this cluster of trees and it's bugging the heck out of me why I missed this and so if you want to take another look at it with me maybe I'll teach you to be a Fossil Finder and so off we went August 15 2008. job myself with a nine-year-old son Matthew my dog Tau we arrived there in that beautiful Wilderness Area and I I take them up and tell them how we found a you know a much shorter version of what I just told you walk up to the site and I say okay there's this little hole in the ground go find fossils if you find one call me I'll identify it let's see what this site has to offer and with that Tau and Matthew are gone you know they they raced off and and you know they're leopards and giraffe and stuff and I think they're going to chase those and they'll see them at lunchtime and so I'm standing there that's not funny [Laughter] and and I'm standing there telling job you know the miners found it but they didn't put much glass and Matthew goes off and he says Dad I found a fossil he calls me 15 years off and I start walking towards him that's actually what I saw this picture taken at the moment it's only this little clump of Rock and five meters away I knew his in my life were about to change forever because inside of that rock I could see something that would look innocuous to you that heard the audience go wow I went wow um because that was a hominid clavicle and at that moment in history I was probably one of the world's only experts on hominy clavicles I'd done my PhD on that bone all six or seven of them had been found to date from that time I knew it exactly it'll sign Matthew said I cursed I don't believe that I turned that rock over and on the back of it was part of a mandible in the rest of the skeleton coming out of that block Matthew found a partial skeleton of a hominid one of the rarest things in all of history there were literally probably seven or so Lucy turkana boy one he would hear of and that was it and he just found one and that was lying on the surface lying on Surface no idea why in that rock and that would lead to the discovery of a new species that that you'll see I mean beautiful skulls things like that all in the area right around there that's right in the Rock they have to be prepared out you know skulls or they're just beautifully complete from an australopatika sediba we would eventually call it a two million year old hominid things like this we had never seen things like that in the fossil record and as we would prepare these blocks out by the way that takes about 22 000 person hours to get to that state from its concrete like things we would eventually find skeletons first time in history two skeletons had been found together at the same deposit and suddenly my life changed yeah you know I went from the guy who was making a career off two teeth to this one of the richest fossil sites ever discovered in Africa we named a new species Australopithecus sediva got on the cover of science well done you ever been on the cover of science not yet three times that's right you know people understand you know being on sign for nature for us are fossils not us it's like for Rock Star being on the cover of Rolling Stone magazine well I have done that oh yeah oh congratulations and you'd always live in the dream my project Grew From one scientist to 40 to 100 and 100 plus in a matter of months and then a year paper after paper in the highest Journal I was applying technology I mean we had the coolest stuff we were taking synchrotron highest energy light sources in the world and we were turning them into these mobile objects that we were doing we were able to create and reconstruct these just amazing uh things by using it was the perfect time the perfect moment to make discoveries you know computers had come along you could image stuff I got to apply Open Access models to it and I got to bring in early career scientists and other people which was just believe it or not anathema tour and open access was rare yeah not only in science in general but in your field in particular which was fairly hold on to your results well it was a field of scarcity you know you didn't find these things and that was it and you know time went by two three four years and then we I started building this laboratory because we found things like Organics over uh in malapa which by the name of the site I named malapa or my home in the sutu language and I I started building this laboratory and suddenly got locked out of the site and realized I hadn't been exploring you know I hadn't I hadn't bought that lottery ticket you know and contrary to what you say you know in my field exploration is the buying of the lottery ticket if you're not exploring you're not going to make the discoveries and it was and so I was thinking well you know what am I going to do while I'm locked out of this site I got this big team ready and that and I remember that map that I created back in 2008 we're now all the way up in 2013. and at that moment a former student of mine Pedro boshoff walks through the door he's bankrupt barefoot in tears he'd lost everything and playing the lottery you know well kind of he went to diamond mining in West Africa but that's as close to that as you you can get and The Coincidence of that was I was beginning to think about what I could do with that map I created of you know now eight or nine hundred localities um that I'd stop doing the moment Matt said dad I found a fossil and I was thinking you know because one of the interesting things is they're not just on the surface every one of those points is potentially a doorway into the underworld into these spaces beneath the ground these labyrinths of cave spaces that cut through that area hundreds of kilometers of them but no one explored them at the time the general sense was there wasn't going to be a fine to be made that's right underground because the idea was that the the older caves were on the surface because the grounds eroding away so the older stuff's on the surface and the caves underground are actually the newer caves and so The Coincidence of all that and the Serendipity of all that was that Pedro was my cating buddy back in the 90s and so I said okay you know let's go look at these let's use my map and go underground but what I want you to do is to actually you know use these sites to to to go to the places we think we know best first because I learned a little bit from gladysville you know things in your own backyard might be the places and so off he went he came back very quickly said he wasn't physiologically appropriate to get into many of the caves he was too fat um and so we very reluctantly or I very reluctantly enlisted with him to amateur cavers Steve Tucker and Rick Hunter who were physiologically appropriate for getting into these sites and out they went and they did a very natural thing they took my map all very excited about it and went to every cave that they didn't know about first and so they had explored some of these kids lots of them have been explored by amateurs and stuff like that you know the bigger ones and stuff so they went for all the the new things it's Human Nature and so I was getting reports we're now moving if you imagine sort of June July August of 2013 they weren't finding much you know little bits and pieces but nothing really exciting then at the last bit they went to a cave called the rising star cave which is a very well known cave it's right to paint the picture of this there are a series of very famous caves caves like strokefontaine and sword crowns which all appear in one Valley that was the historical place of discovery ninety percent of the fossil discoveries of ancient humeral does it occurred in three sites that are within a kilometer of each other the rising star cave is a kilometer from that right in the middle of this thing and so everyone's been in it it's used for training of cavers I've been in it in the 90s you know there's nothing there but they were dutifully going through everything and they went in this one night September 13th and went through the cave four and a half hours reached an area called Dragon's Back this is this area imagine it's like 120 meters back into a Cave System 30 meters underground and they crawled up this Dragon's Back which is a rock collapse to the top of it and at the very top of it Steve was trying to take a picture get a picture of himself and he slid into this little slot and his legs went down a hole and he told Rick it goes and cavers that means like it doesn't stop big word I know and being young and skinny and insane down he went not knowing if it opened up into a big thing and he dies or whatever if he could get out and it goes 12 meters down into a chamber and inside that chamber they saw some bones on the ground little white specks like those and you know what they were but they took pictures of them that picture and they went out took them forever to get out they the next couple of days I've seen at home nine o'clock at night and my intercom this is Johannesburg Gates and everything long distance to your house but intercom goes nine o'clock at night I answer it and there's Pedra on the other side he says you're going to want to let us in creepy like that and I almost didn't then I did and Stephen Pedra come in they opened their laptop they showed me this picture and they shall be the next picture ah there I got one there I got one that is a hominid mandible and immediately I realized that that's not just any hominid I could tell by the audience reaction they too realize that that is a primitive hominid because the tooth morphology extends to a larger and larger molar row which I could tell at least 80 percent of you knew instantly and I thought oh my goodness no human being I guarantee you had ever seen an image like that anywhere on the planet like I said 22 000 hours to get that skull out this is laying on the floor and every picture they showed me had another one and another one and another one and they described the situation it was in this 130 meters back up this climb and down the shaft that they happily fed the shoot-like thing they described was 19 and a half centimeters as its widest 17 centimeters at its narrowest with all these terrible moments in it and these guys you know these guys are the size of paper and I was like I will never do this that's it that's the entrance that's the wide part look at his helmet folks to get an idea of that you want to see you want to see how really bad it is this yeah here we go this is what it looks like to get there this is the easy part folks is what we call Superman's crawl and this is where you have to Superman because you know the flying position you extend your arm out and you go oh come on we oh I get through this uh it's that's not not terrible you go through this you climb Dragon's Back you then get to the hard part the shoot area that that you go it's not that bad folks it really isn't cheap even in this dark I can see the claustrophobes like all going you know looking down at the ground and well you're making me anxious right now I need a sedative for an MRI you want you want you want to be anxious let's look at what it's like if we can of what it's like to come through the Chute I think the next video does that this makes me anxious this is when I was a baby I think you came out feet first let's explain maybe yeah that's right so is that now at the end the first chamber you're in these spaces in these very narrow spaces and that's what we had to do so you got to remember I'm seeing this I get I go through there and I'm wondering how we're going to do this by the way in order to test I'd hire these amateurs to see whether it was real because you know I'm trusting the entire reputation of my team if I if I put together an expedition to do this I didn't tell you this because right after Pedro and Steve left I'm all full of this oh my goodness this is gigantic Discovery they're lying on the floor 2 A.M in the morning I called the head of Missions at National Geographic Society Terry Garcia to him my time it was like earlier in in the US and even though I had caller ID he answered the phone and I showed it I said you knew your computer I showed him those pictures and I said if you are ever going to believe in me believe in me right now that's Explorer speak for I need money so yeah and they had funded you in the past yeah okay and he paused for a little bit and he said okay Lee do what you need to do that's thunder speak for okay he's been somebody you know don't do too much on that I hung up the phone and I got cold feet because you know I'm just risking I have this incredible yeah I mean I mean the I'm living the dream of science you know I have this incredible team one of the biggest teams ever assembled for this all these Prestige papers and all that and I've just risked the entire reputation onto amateurs in this sort of situation a place I will never go but you saw the photo right was with that you ever seen Photoshop no seriously yeah you're worried that could wow people do funny things huh oh come on someone just faked a shark picture and it was a plastic model you saw that from Greek I mean it'll do anything yeah well I've seen Bigfoot too you know it's not so how was I going to test this so I knew someone I trusted that could fit in there my then 15 year old very skinny son Matthew so I taught him how to use a scientific camera at scale sent him through went through with him sent him down was it was Dad at all concerned about this did he damage the camera oh man his mother didn't know so there I am seen in the dark he's down 30 minutes he comes back up he has a camera and you know as his head emerges from this death-defying thing because I'm going for father of the year you can all tell here I didn't go you know are you okay I went and and he goes he turns around and said Dad it was so beautiful my hands were shaking for three minutes before I could take a picture and he shows me the back of that and there they are it's real so I'd go out that night after coming out of that terrible thing and I'm like how am I going to do this I need people I need people who can climb or skinny who have degrees and phds and can excavate precious material how am I going to find that and now of course the amateur Community knows about this right you're worried I'm worried yeah they're just lying there I mean you can't close this off I mean it's a it's not even on my land you know it's on someone's land yeah and so I'm thinking how do you do this and so I guess I did what anyone would do I put a Facebook ad out you don't have to read that it says I need skinny scientists that are willing to drop everything and come for an expedition they have to have a PhD or equivalent or be studying for one they have to have excavation experience climate experience caving experience not claustrophobic work well in teams are willing to work for free and I'm not going to tell you what you're going to do and you're going to risk your life and I sent that out and I thought you know there are three or four people in the world might qualify for that I got 57 qualified applicants of which I selected six of them who were the most qualified who just happened to be young women and they were extraordinary um and we launched what was called the rising star Expedition after the cave itself to get these things I designed this whole system this nasa-like system you know with a command center and three and a half kilometers of cables with security cameras and all that doing it and we started this Expedition and I also decided by the way to live stream it to the whole world had a million followers by the end of this Expedition day two we knew I was wrong it wasn't a hominid skeleton it was more than one hominid skeleton we had three right femurs by the end of the week we had brought up from underground in these extreme circumstances more hominid fossils that had been found at the richest site in the world to that date certain decades which was a kilometer away one week it taken 90 years to get that strokefontaine by the end of an expedition at three and a half weeks we discovered the richest series of hominid discoveries in all of history in the middle of it we were just everyone knew this was like it was like a moon moment you know you can see the emotion I think on the faces we were just in awe of this moment that we were in that Discovery was happening and you know this was like scientific Nirvana you know it's uh and you'll see the kind of conditions they were working in you know deep underground the this is what they were doing in these spaces they were incredible they were heroiced I at one time during an interview in that period I said you know I'm looking at these I'm seeing them on these images they're like astronauts they're so remote from us when this happens they're like underground astronauts boy I wish I'd never said that because I've got hate mail from around the world because I know it should be troglenauts or you know spelionauts or whatever but I said it and it caught on and then I got in trouble for it but it stuck and and you know you can see how big they are by the way look at Becca here um this is the kind of size of people that get into these spaces yeah how do they carry the bones out in a little tiny bags inside of this really we had this hugely complex development that I'd done of Tupperware that you closed and put the thing in in foil and then in toilet paper inside Tupperware inside a waterproof bag and hand carried out in a sort of chain uh we would go I the lab suddenly got busy and scientists started flying in from all over the world I think you can see a picture of the lab that we we constructed coming up there we would work all day people were all these scientists were right it was so cool it was live signs happening in the middle of the world we were working late into the night I mean you know you there's some images I think of us in night in there and you know all this time we're watching these images of them on the screen going back and forth back and forth they're working for hours and hours and hours and it was unbelievable these are the kind of images we saw I mean this is this is incredible these you see these images of that's the kind of thing that you're watching I would spend the next seven years staring at images like this this place um I just want the audience to know that I am an equal opportunity child abuser that's my daughter Megan who's in the audience today somewhere they're here she's University of Queensland vet school right there that's a position called Shoot troll um she's up at the top there and her job was to go up and down the Chute I used her to test the safety equipment before I sent the ass time I was in I didn't tell her mother that either uh look I'm sending other people's children and I need to be able to risk my own and I'm serious about that I I was taking other people's kids into the extreme spaces into that expedition it was extraordinary and you know from this little chamber deep underground a tiny space that's sort of 10 meters long by five meters wide we discovered over 1 500 individual fossils from a one meter by 50 centimeter excavation the richest single put that in perspective folks to that point in history in sub-equatorial Africa there'd probably been 1100 individual fossils found about 80 percent isolated teeth huh three weeks and there was clearly more of them in there and could you tell how many individuals were after we started looking at these fossils you know we had skulls we had actual schools and skulls are rare you know we had that one from there we had skulls like this you know and we had slightly bigger ones and little ones it was clear they were really weird from it we had dentition we had you know dozens and dozens of teeth we had foot bones that were just completely our things this like this you know you should go off for this because paleontologists around the world went holy cow these are not the kind of things we see in the fossil record you know the Primitive hominin fossil record we had we had hands that were actually sitting articulated just like that one just like that it was unbelievable and and stupidly odd we knew that as we were looking and you were looking at a thing that was different at the end of it we had this just assemblage you could lay out just dozens and dozens and dozens and dozens 1500 fossils for 15 plus individuals it was unbelievable and then I got to play science in terms of interpreting what the heck this is absolutely and I got to play science in a way that was really really nasty I said you know there was a thing in our field about you had to have experience to study ancient hominid fossils and there was even someone who said that if you haven't studied one before you shouldn't be allowed to study another one that's the Shaker kind of mentality of of of you know science where eventually you all die out and everyone just looks at the things I guess um and so I I pick particularly young people from across the very best and brightest hugely diverse and brought them together as a gigantic team to study these and we had the time of our lives the Only Rule was they had to they had to release all of their data sets to the team so we shared data and made it open access across the field and then we named a new species and started finding more of them not just in that chamber but in other Chambers nearby we found a skeleton from a chamber 100 meters away that was in an Alcove up on the wall a beautiful thing maybe one of the bigger individuals we found it had a beautiful skull I mean just almost the complete thing that you could look at you can actually see this face of this tiny brained hominid a hominid that had a brain about a third the size of a human it was clearly primitive there's one you can see it they had they had this kind of rounded crating kind of like a human but that these brow ridges that you can see there that flattened face that would prognatic that is the nose stuck out the teeth were small but primitive like I saw in that first mandible but that's where most studies in our field would have ended but we had these bodies everything from neonates to the elderly and so we could begin to construct the whole anatomy and what we saw was this bizarre Mosaic creature you know it had it had shoulders like an ape it had a spine like a mini Neanderthal a pelvis like a hominid that was three or four million years old like Lucy's pelvis but then as you move down the limbs towards the the feet and the hands they became more and more advanced until you reach these hands that while they were curved they were almost super human-like with really long thumbs and the feet as you got to them the long skinny legs and they became almost human-like except for having slightly curved toes it was like this mishmash of every species that we'd found from like three million years old to say a million years old we would put it all together and we could look at this creature you could actually see its physical body effectively and reconstruct it and compare it to other hominids and so you got this visual reconstruction of a of of this living creature standing next to all these other homes now if you just say had the feet you would have reconstructed a different looking creature who is it human huh if it had hands we would have said funny human with a long thumb if we'd had the teeth we would have said maybe it's a mini robust australopithecine or primitive australopithesia if we'd had the face we would have said oh that's that's an australopitheism if we had the head Cranium we would said Homo habilis maybe a bit of homo erectus thrown in there if I had the spine where you said funky Neanderthal but there are no neanderthals in Africa so we had the shoulders I might have said Gibbon and so we did what scientists do time and again we named a new species homo naletti we put it in the genus homo because of that head and because we felt the overall grade adaptation was to bipedalism and living on the ground that this was in our ilk more so than australopi but we debated it a long time it hovered there on the edge of both sides depending on what part you looked at you know we could build it this is one John Gertz he's a great reconstructions we could build this whole image of this guy and that was so exciting because maybe the audience people in the audience I bet some of them realize that we didn't get to do this with certainty before this moment almost every other Discovery you've ever heard about in this field is built from scraps and often built from scraps that we are not a hundred percent sure belong to the same thing and with the exception of perhaps I'd argue Neanderthals we just don't have a highly diverse record of young and old and so the ability to build an image of one of these and then lots of them at different age groups and the ability to understand them was was truly unknown at that time I mean you know Australopithecus sediva and malapa had been extraordinary but it wasn't this this was that on steroids and we were sitting there with this knowledge that something weird was going on and here's what that weird thing was by the end of the first week as we were sitting there in this Command Center imagine everyone and you saw the emotion on everyone's face which is like I had to buy there was a joke going around during the expedition of you know we're gonna need a bigger Vault you know remember that scene in Jaws where the shark comes up and goes we're going to need a bigger boat we need a bigger safe because we brought these safes out to keep the you know the five pieces we were certain we were going to find we had 400 by the end of the the thing and but what I didn't kind of highlight was we had only hominids only hominids from those deep Chambers nothing else was coming out just these fossil human relatives I remember very poignantly at the end of the first week you know this all happened to us at the end of the day these filthy underground astronauts come out one of Marina had brought out the last bit and I look at it and it's all hominy and I said are you guys cheating are you actually picking up only the you know and leaving the you know the animals behind and they went nope we're taking them as they come and over beers that night with a couple of scientists I remember this really powerful moment that was occurring because you know all of us a lot of us had trained in lots of things I was a geologist an archaeologist and part of being an archaeologist you train is sore forensic anthropology and one of the things you learn as a forensic anthropologist when you're studying natural occurrences whether they're collected by carnivores or catastrophe they're always mixed you get animals and everything and in fact in the hominid record it's like 99.9 animals 0.1 hominins we had never seen a situation that was all hominins well we actually had but not in the ancient fossil record we see it all the time in human assemblages the reason we see it all the time in human assembly is because humans sort themselves after death from the natural world and we have places that we put ourselves mostly separate you know sometimes we put our dead poodles with us or if you're a pharaoh you're dead cats and Falcons but mostly we put up ourselves with each other or alone and so it was becoming pretty clear even by week two there must be another explanation and so when we published this new species in 2015. in the journal E-Life you'll remember that we said something incredibly controversial we said that the only possible reason that there could be only hominids in this deep dark remote chamber is that they put themselves there they must have gone through some sort of ritualized behavior of carrying their dead into these spaces and I'll tell you before it's in your mind know the spaces haven't changed that much no other entrance no other entrances they're going into this extraordinary space the way we do and they're taking their debt in there and they're disposing of them in a ritualized manner I want to be careful there because ritual means different things to different people I was very careful of saying ritual means repeated because while the world accepted our new species very readily because we had so much to say that a tiny brain hominid was actually disposing of its dead in a ritualized manner in a place like this that was received and so you ever heard the saying of you know received it floated like a lead balloon that was kind of how the reception was because those type of Mortuary behaviors are related to a big brain we claim it as ours it is a human thing it's done by humans it's done because our big brain and the way we are and it only happens 60 70 000 years ago in our lineage maybe a little earlier and even the cases where people say it may have occurred in the other large Brain thing neanderthals the few cases where they think there may be burial that took Decades of fighting to even be remotely thing we were stepping into the definition of Human by the way did you know there's no definition of human brine if you ask me to be I'd be hard-pressed to give you a definition so I can well remember so is Webster's Dictionary and every other side probably just kind of circular right it's like humans are people who are kind of like humans or something like that he's not joking look it up look at Google Google the definition of a human it'll say having the characteristic of people or a person if you look up homo sapiens it'll say having the characteristic of a human um you know why because we don't have an out group right everything's like us that does like us and we see ourselves as totally human exceptionalism but can I ask you I mean just to play Devil's advociversity I mean you know obviously I know you fielded a thousand variations on the following theme but one at least can imagine other explanations I mean the one that comes to mind for me which I'm sure you can shoot down is what if everybody went into the cave alive and the ones you found are the ones that couldn't get back out yeah great um like like people like me had gone [Laughter] extra later um the answer is that we threw one of the largest scientific teams in history at this problem we did not say it lightly and we eventually like Sherlock Holmes had worked our way through we could prove they weren't washed in there we could prove that they had come in over time somewhere earlier somewhere later they had come in whole we can see that as bodies they were violating gravity and all that they had it wasn't a catastrophic event it wasn't some movement of water there were no evidence of carnivores there or Scavenging or any marks on their bodies and eventually after that and lots of other evidence we had eliminated all the probable and we were left with the improbable that we had discovered the first time in history that a non-human species and something that clearly is outside of our grade that was practicing some sort of deliberate moratorium that remains controversial I'm hoping not for long but it remains controversial today and what really made it tough was with this tiny brain hominid that by then people were had rapidly began telling us we didn't have a date for it we couldn't tell you how old it was now that's a problem in pale of anthropology because everyone thinks dates wrongly by the way are super important for saying where something fits because everyone thinks Evolution works like a biblical story of you know in austro afferences begets Homo habilis begets Homo erectus but it doesn't happen that way species can arise as a fission or breakout and the others can continue quite happily that's why we can see coelacans today you know just keep on going they keep on going and so it's much more complex but humans have always seen themselves as so exceptional that we have this sort of image that once the next better mousetrap evolves nothing can so we had scientists that were saying that the morphology of noleti was showing that it was really probably just some kind of primitive Homo erectus it must be when they say that they mean 2 million 2.2 2.3 million years old or it's a another species of primitive homo or it's even a late australopi but all of them were you know a million and a half two and a half million years old you could look at its Anatomy but we threw the kitchen sink beginning a date because no one had ever you gotta remember you gotta be sympathetic with us no one had ever found a whole bunch of hominids lying on the floor in a dirt cave and then immediately beneath the floor we didn't have technology we invented it um with by the way quite a lot of Australian researchers some from Griffith University here and others with your great facilities here and we broke through the day yes indeed that does deserve a round of the thought thank you Australian research committee and Australian government and do it again um and we broke through we invented new ways we refined new ways to come to these answers and then we announced how old they were and the answer is Young incredibly Young so young that it was unbelievable in fact there you see their tiny little brain at 230 000 to 330 000 years ago more than a million and a half plus years is what they should have been by their looks right in the middle of Africa at the time when only Homo sapiens should have been there at the exact moment when we thought that modern human mind was arising from all the archeology that was appearing we were seeing the development of more complex archeology coming along and that blew everyone away and how confident are you of those dates I am confident that some of them are that old which is all you need really to make the point yes my hesitancy in your answer is that we've obviously been continuing the research and I suspect that things are going to change um I think that we have encountered something extraordinary the idea that if a small brain to primitive hominy and by the way that does it doesn't mean our colleagues are wrong that homo naledi doesn't exist in a million a million and a half two million years remember the coelacanth example that I gave what it means is these groups of them at least some of them aren't that age right but it means they existed back then it also means they could come forward in time we're not witnessing an Extinction event so I think there's going to be big news in the future about the range the time range and you know just because you have to be talking to someone who kind of maybe knows that there are going to be alterations in that and this is one cave area right you have many other sizes potentially um we have yet to find definitively hormonality elsewhere but I would caution you if you go back to that brief Anatomy lesson I was talking about it'd be hard to see something like this if you didn't have the whole picture and it would be easy to take bits and pieces and mix it into other things that we had and not see the whole particularly in a record that has been as sparse as as as we have when you look at this Mosaic Anatomy we are on the edge of just incredible things Brian I mean it is we've been at this I by the way I didn't stop exploring we have made other discoveries in other places I learned my lesson from gladysville and learned my lesson from sediba I learned my lesson from this I didn't stop exploring during covid we discovered 250 meters away from the site and entirely another giant site full of hominid fossils but not these fossils something different and that was really cool too because coven was great for us don't don't hate it knocked me off my pedestal of success it took me out of this rut of you know here I was I built this gigantic organization that was based on scientists we make a discovery scientist fly in from all over the world they work with it that they Mentor all my young scientists in Africa we get the papers out we'd scribe them off we go my teams are working in confined humid spaces underground where if they get stuck we have to send in other people to rescue them and we're all working in you know we even our preparation within these rooms together that are likely properly poorly ventilated but don't say that and you know and then a pandemic comes along and I went from hero to zero in minutes you know South Africa did not have an easy lockdown I know you didn't too but ours ours is worse than yours um and so I had to start up and it made me redesign it and I had to figure out how to excavate a site and so I did and and I'm reading I couldn't work underground so I took the underground and brought it above ground watch the Youtube videos it's really funny and and it also made me realize that I'd made a mistake with with my idea that bringing in the best and brightest scientists all the time was a way of mentoring the young African scientists who were coming up what it also was doing was they could do it better and faster so it was a form of mentoring but it also meant there was always someone right above you that you couldn't be through so I'm standing here with this discovery that we made in the middle of covert we brought the cave up and there they were you know these new type hominids and I had all these young people around me and I said you know what I haven't done is I haven't given them the leadership on this so I did and you know how what they did they did great you know they just turned on the afterburners all right so you're watching all these wonderful discoveries taking place but you're close but one step removed watching it in a television monitor computer screen you must have wanted to go down right to be part of it you know I used to cover up that desire you know from the moment that Stephen Pedro showed me those images and described the situation and when I crawled up there and sent Matthew down and was staring down into that void I knew I'd never fit into this space I used to joke that you know my ego was too large to actually fit into that that that shoot area and a lot of that was a way of covering up that I just couldn't do it you know with people that were going in are fit they're smaller than me and things began to change is over the years I was watching this and you know I'm watching it through these video screens I'm remote from it but just before coven we made a discovery and that Discovery was sort of shocking I think to all of us I was in the command center Canoe moliopane one of my mentees was sitting next to me and we were watching the underground astronauts Excavating and they had moved the camera that day so it sat up above them behind them over their shoulder it normally sat on the side so I could be monitoring where their hands were saying oh you know hold on that looks like a mandible this looks like stop or and they moved it because it was in the way of the excavation and it was an infrared camera and a weird thing happened because as they would shift occasionally they would block the light that was adjacent to them that we were shining on it and it would shift infrared and in a moment I've seen they're staring into this excavation you gotta remember that's happening for days and days and days of the tedium you know you're like a NASA watching a space flight occur where you can never touch it right and I saw the shift and I realized that there was an edge to what they were digging I could see a physical feature and I turned to Kenny and I said you know you see that and she looked at it and I said this is a line This is a feature and I suddenly realized something that maybe been sitting in the back of my mind and some of our scientists through this remarkable thing where we're looking at this assemblage the world's largest assemblage of hominid it's coming from these tiny areas we'd always been terrified to say the words burial I'd been as you know I'd been super careful over the years to say ritual disposal of the debt because we're dealing with a hominid with a brain slightly larger than chimpanzee burial Graves that's a human thing in fact if you had to talk about something that almost defines a big brain human behavior that's the the thing you know that's our well it's one of the things and the earliest known ones to that point were like a hundred thousand years at most 78 000 to 85 000 you know it's young yeah sure and Neanderthal is younger than that and controversial and I'm staring at I realized it's this is hole in the ground they've been digging a hole in the ground with a curled up body in it one body in a fetal position and sudden I could see it from a trick of a light and I told him to stop oh boy they were not happy I will tell you that they were you know because they're right here they they are and this is a terrible place you know you you're risking your life every time you go in well we do the science we do the excavations we would find out it was a burial it was a grave I'm on the lady went in and dug holes put whole bodies in them in a flexed position like a fetal position you can actually see the remnants of the Holy See the remnants of the hole they dug even to where the dirt clods are tossed out of it then they put those bags on Wow and you suddenly find out all the Mysteries why we were getting these dense bodies the first excavation we uh we worked in back in 2013 you know where we recovered that incredible assemblage of of hominid parts from one meter by 50 centimeters you know why it was four or five overlapping Graves like a medieval symmetry where they dug through didn't know the body was there toss them together and put them back it explained the articulated remains it explained why there were vertical bones because the bodies had been sitting up and had collapsed on themselves the material we saw on the surface was stuff that had dribbled out as the mound of dirt settled below the body then we found the same thing in the hill anti-chamber we found children four of them in one hole one little 13-ish year old body curled up the whole body two faces just the faces of children and a fetus in one hole in a slope and nothing else no grave Goods or anything well funny you should ask because when we scan this we actually took it out in a plaster jacket hole which was no mean feat you've heard the description of this thing it had to fit through 17 and a half centimeters so we had to get this thing up it weighed probably 70 kilos you can imagine getting up that 12 meters when we scanned it with CT scan one rock in this whole thing you can see the base of the Grave you see where they dug into it and that rock is sitting in the hand the child that's curled into a fetal position and it's shaped like a tool now no human being has ever touched that to this moment it's still in that plaster jacket oh is it we've synchrotroned it we have it at 30 microns in this paper we just published there's we've been very cautious that calling it a tool shaped Rock but I'm not much of a betting guy I'm a scientist but I'll tell you it shouldn't be there there's no other rocks like that and it's shaped exactly like the first tool with art on it from blumbass cave at 78 000 years done by Homo sapiens shaped identical it looks like a kind of Engraving tool and is it but it's in the child's literally sitting in the child's hand is it or isn't it it's probably going to be argued for the next either hundred years or the next few months until we find another one that's right yeah right but so you started this with getting down there at the beginning of last year I I'm turning 57 now here you know 2022. spring chicken yeah not so much not for caving and I was staring at these papers that we were preparing and this is a big deal I think this is the biggest Discovery I will make in my entire career I mean we're about to describe a non-human species that buries its dead potentially hundreds of thousands of years before humans invent that that's a big deal yeah and I think it is the biggest deal as we're writing this paper which I think is probably going to be the biggest paper that I will participate in in my entire life all these contradictions begin to appear ideas of geology geological problems it didn't make sense you know that we had still a geologists or two were saying no well there's some there's some lateral flow or movement of material maybe Waters involved and yet all the geology all the thin sections say that's not true there were there were problems with the way that that we were describing the relationship between the two burial Chambers the hill chamber in the denality chamber and and there were a bunch of little sort of minor things but I'm sitting here thinking I cannot put out this gigantic discovery that is literally going to affect archeology and pale anthropology forever if we don't have everything and so I started looking at myself I'd of course like everyone put a little bit of covered kilos on and uh and I've always been a big guy and I'm tall and so in February I was I realized that we were going to have Expeditions in the middle of the year into this area I wanted to excavate in the chamber adjacent to the burial Chambers dragons back where we kid up and get ready to climb and go down you've seen those images just now and so I started losing weight my wife and daughter were like saying oh we got covered kilos I just was quiet I didn't tell anyone I started losing weight by just eating less eating less eating high protein smaller portions starting to work out a lot and lost 25 kilos 25 25 kilos so chunk of weight 50. 32 in wait I've been that since I was in the Navy and and coming up on the Expedition uh in in July we started the day we started the expedition canalway was going to be leading the team Excavating in the Dragon's Back chamber I climbed up we had a documentary crew filming I said time and I climbed up dragon's back with some colleagues that flown out for this this this work from the U.S and I got to the top then at the back of dragon's back where the Chute is and I took them up there showed them that they'd never seen it they go down as they hook harnesses and go down this really this hard climb and I stayed and I slid back into that space and it did something I'd never done before I slid into this shoot thinking you were going to go down or not checking it out right there not right there you would too un you do not go down low yeah I don't think you just freelance but I slid into it and dropped myself in got my pelvis back and waist and then stared down into the abyss wow I said I can make this I came out had the days in brief and I said I'm going to make this attempt tomorrow you should have seen the faces of my explorers they were not uh thrilled I think but they some of them were like you can do this others were like you know you could see the and so the next morning did you have caving experience I've been for you know for decades okay you know I'm so it wasn't a matter of it's not experience I would be by far the largest person that's gone in both in physical dimensions and height yeah only 47 humans had ever been in that space and because of the danger and the difficulty and so the next morning I made the attempt and gone in and from the moment I got in I knew this was the hardest thing I'd ever do in my life I mean it was it was terrible I mean it was it's not a shoot I don't know how we've described it like that that tells you it's a vertical chimney-like thing it's not it's a labyrinth and you're moving actually laterally almost five meters As you move down this and that's a long way when you're moving through spaces that you can't even turn your head nor see your feet and that's before you get to the 17 and a half inch squeeze which is about halfway down six meters or so down and I got to that and I pushed into it and realized that I had to make a decision because it's not going down you got to come up too yeah going down you have gravity and I hit my chest and realize that if I push this next thing I might not be able to get out of this and we can't I answer all those questions no we can't modify it it's a Labyrinth of of of of chert layers and stuff and this is gigantic ancient Dolomite you break the wrong stick on this that whole thing can come down not only destroying the fossil situation but killing you in the process and anyone else near you it doesn't collapse in little bits and so I pushed in and went on in now that was emotional everything if I get in finally and it was hard and I'm sitting in the hill anti-chamber standing there and I'm very emotional you know you haven't been able to breathe properly so I'm hyperventilating kind of thing properly because I didn't think I'd ever be in there and I an identify anything which you'd appreciate I decided I was not going to take a picture because I've been watching this place digitally for almost well three quarters of a decade I want to narrate so I took a narration out and I started talking describing everything at a measuring device and talking and describing everything and I start describing these and I immediately start seeing things we missed like simple things that don't mean a lot to people right now but the dirt wasn't coming out of the shoot and we've actually written that I don't know how we quite missed it but it's coming out of another passage so the dirt that's in the chamber is coming from the interior of the cave no one was throwing bodies into this it didn't come they don't the dirt's not coming from where we're coming in we're just coming in the way we can fit says there's another well there's internal entrances that don't go anywhere I see okay then I noticed that flowstones on the ground had been broken but not by us in the Deep past and moved uphill place had broken them to get to the dirt underneath to bury the bodies underneath because flat plates don't move uphill yeah and these are little things that people have been in there but only like three geologists have ever been in there people quit noticing these things you know it's backyard syndrome you and I have talked about that before the idea that you quit seeing places you're familiar with particularly places that are hard to get to you've almost died getting there and you're worried about getting out and you're there to do a job and then I get to the edge of the chamber and there's this passage that leads from the hill burial chamber to the dinality chamber where the big burial places are and it wasn't like what I I'd imagine seeing on images when you're there it's totally different it's a doorway and I say this you know I say it's smaller than I thought it looks like a doorway and I'm I'm an archaeologist I see doorways what do you see above doorways let me see there's a doorway what's above it the exit sign yeah a sign yeah and I looked at it and looked to the left and actually couldn't believe what I saw there on the left hand side we're carvings Engravings symbols first thing I saw as a cross went up right side up went upside down a box a square and you saw triangles I saw a fish-shaped image I mean I don't know if it is a fish or not it's a it's a non-geometric image ladders it's incredible all etched into this 2.9 billion year old rock and people had just walked by them isn't that insane I mean I know I I gather the back here I get it but I mean you have trained team the world's great you know wouldn't someone I did it surprise you it you know I thought a lot about that obviously because you know I go to them I look at them I almost had a Transcendent experience it was really weird and I'm often embarrassed to even talk about it like this but I know why it happens physiologically but that material I looked at them and they actually floated off it when I turned on a black light onto them they floated in space you know kind of like Queen's Gambit sort of stuff that you see a beautiful mind and I know why it happened it's a light shift phenomena you would understand that it's what happens when you see car lights at night as they move in the opposite direction you know why your brain does it but yeah it's still very weird yeah um I was probably close to a trance stated you could probably get you know from exhaustion and fear and all that kind of thing but um I think that Pathfinder syndrome had sort of built in it's a dangerous place the first people in are risking their lives everyone's preaching get back alive you know that's the thing that's why some few people live and you become very Mission focused we were there to dig almost always we were digging in those far Chambers by the time the third fourth or fifth person has gone in everyone gets the Explorer mindset which is so dangerous smart just what you said smart people have been here that they've seen everything that's here that's not my job my job is in there I think that's what happened and I'm there with a different mindset one to solve problems and two I know for damn sure I will never be back in this space this is my shot this is my first and last time to be in here right anyway I describe them I am blown away I can't believe it I'm looking at Engravings and I know no humans have been in here other than us these aren't us and I could see there were layers they'd actually erased older images with dirt from the ground and then carved through them again maybe to highlight them we see that in Upper Paleolithic images all the time and these images I knew looked like the things we've seen you know neanderthals doing we see well not so much that but humans doing yeah you know the earliest Engravings these geometric forms it looks like the earliest art anyway I go through I go through the whole cave over the next three hours or so I discovered soot on the ceiling that we hadn't seen you know our explorers hadn't been looking up fire was in there and it was right in front of our eyes because in earlier accounts remember it was saying there's no evidence no evidence and you yeah when we you and I talked about this you know fire is hard to see in a couple of minutes we talked ourselves out of the obvious scientists are human too folks they're human too and you know you these things happen all the time there are thousands scientific discovery stories just like this aren't there yeah where something someone suddenly sees something right in front of everyone else and I finish and I'm coming back down this passage and I decided to do a funny thing I'm coming out I'm all I'm thinking about is I've got to survive this climb out and then I say you know what this is my last chance in here I want to be the height of naletti and so I got down on my knees In this passage and started crawling and I got back in just opposite the back of that those images carved on the left hand side of the door so now it's the right hand side of the best I see this gigantic cross hatch type hashtag crosses I mean gigantic right there as bright as that exit son you know I'd even walk by it on the way in and there it was carved deep into this over an algal stromatolite billions of years old and then done multiple times so somebody worked hard and multiple multiple times you know I discovered the earliest symbols ever create first time humans have recognized symbols created by a non-human species with a brain slightly larger than a chimpanzees we've we've seen that something I mean none of us as you know burials are one thing meaning making symbols carved into the wall above those burials and in the passages by we thought that that's us it's not us and it's hundreds of thousands of years before us thinks about that now one question immediately comes to mind I'm sure it's been thrown at you a thousand times but at what point do you think you're reading more into it like could it just be like the Mindless Doodles of the unconscious mind just you know they're down there and I'm not reading anything to it I hadn't said the word art yeah I haven't said the word I said they're meaning making symbols even an unconscious doodle is a meaning making symbol right nothing does that nothing on the planet that we're aware of has ever done that other than large brained humans and possibly neanderthals which are large Brain humans and how do you distinguish it from other things that are granted are different but like Bower Birds when they make their their nest to try to try where they make a elaborate design that's a radically different kind of radically different kind of thing that's a that's a a sort of it's I believe that I think I think we may as humans be in a moment where we're about to lose our specialness human special nature the idea of human exceptionalism maybe just died I don't know if that's that different I know we made it different but homo naledi just proved us that another species with a brain that's not our brain and much smaller but smaller but incredibly smaller yeah accomplished effectively the entire cultural package that probably was used moments before the definition of what it means to be human it's an absolutely remarkable story and it is something that we will all be looking forward to and you know thanks enormously for all you're doing to clarify where we all came from thanks Brian and thank you guys by the way I love Brisbane oh my goodness [Applause] I'll get in trouble for this on YouTube but it's like Miami without Miami Miami [Laughter] thank you he said that I'm gonna say it too um and and secondly I just want to say one thing I hope what you get from this because I really want to inspire you know I speak to kids all over the world and part of what the thing is is often they're depressed about the idea that they won't be they don't know how they're going to contribute young scientists how they're told that all the great discoveries have been made that if you're moving in you're just standing on the shoulders of giants and one of the reason I want to tell my whole story and I hope you see that that's just not true we haven't touched discovery we are at the front edge and I'm a field that thought it was over 20 years ago there was nothing left to find and if it can happen in a field like this what must it be in every other I know you are a believer in this but we are at a moment I assure you the greatest stage of exploration was not when guys went out on ships and and introduced themselves to a place that was already found like Australia okay it's right now absolutely this is the greatest age of exploration this is an age where you are all Explorers with us that we have technology we can ask questions and Brilliant Minds can invent it if not someone who you will invent it and give it to us and share it you have all of Humanity's knowledge in a phone in your pocket and there's stuff to find folks just never stop exploring so please join me in thanking a great Explorer in the great Age of Exploration thank you man dancing thank you thank you thank you thank you everyone thank you [Music] thank you "
