"in sumerian tradition and in the surviving texts that have been passed down to us there is a very strong and intriguing reference to what are called the seven anti-diluvian sages go over to india and we have the seven rishis uh so this this number keeps on cropping up we can go further away to easter island and there we discover an ancient tradition that civilization was first brought to easter island by seven initiated men now how are we to take all of this and how can we put it into some kind of context for me what i think what i think we're looking at uh is more evidence that there was a a high civilization that we have lost track of that we truly are a species with amnesia and that we have forgotten a very important part of our story and and fragments of that story crop up all around the world "
