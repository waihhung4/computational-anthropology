"oh the emergence of bronze smelting and bronze vessels marked the time in which China entered a great Bronze Age that was to last more than 1,500 years through the Shia Shang and Joe dynasties and it was in this period of World Civilization that ancient China began to make great advances the bronze vessels discovered in China are first in the world in terms of quantity and degree of Exquisite craftsmanship also appearing in the Bronze Age are the Oracle bone inscriptions of the Shang Dynasty found in the Yen ruins these Oracle bone inscriptions Mark the beginning of the time in China from which objects and era can be identified by characters [Music] [Music] around 4,000 years ago there was a massive flood across the land of China and the first large scale natural disaster to be recorded in the history of China many people were killed others deprived of their homes in the fight between people and nature there appeared a Great Hero named duu who led the people to harness the rivers and control the flooding enabling the people to live and work in peace and contentment e [Music] modern science has proved that at the end of the glacial period there was indeed a worldwide flood on the earth and that it was caused by the warming of the global climate this great flood has become a remote memory of All Peoples everywhere in the world but the difference between the various fables and legends of China and those of other countries lies in the fact that the name duu is clearly recorded in an ancient document and that he is closely related to the beginning of a Nation because of his success in harnessing the flood duu became universally respected and was raised to the status of head of a tribal Alliance that was the Chinese nation of the time eventually he established the Shah Dynasty the earliest Dynasty in China's history for the capital city not only served as the political economic and cultural center of a dynasty but also as an embodiment of the development of human civilization many Sensational archaeological discoveries have been made related to capitals particularly when exploring the civilizations of remote Antiquity in 1959 while referring to passages and ancient documents well-known archaeologist Shu xuong conducted an invis instigation in areas where people of the Sha Dynasty were known to have been active in the process he discovered many Pottery fragments at Aro Village in yanu County hen Province his knowledge of the field led him to consider that he might have found the site of an ancient capital city later at arito archaeologists Unearthed the foundations of two large Palace sites the earliest ever found in China [Music] [Music] now bronze vessels turquoise inlaid bronze plaques with animal face designs and Jade X's were Unearthed from a number of medium and small-sized tombs according to ancient records duu divided the land into nine states and after collecting bronze resources from all over the country he had nine ding cast to represent the area of his nation and indeed bronze ding was found at the AO site and it is the earliest found so far was it one of the nine ding cast by duu were these bronze vessels made by the Sha people fore around the 17th century BC the Sha Dynasty ended and the Shang Dynasty began and it is said that the N ding made by duu pass down to the sh Dynasty [Music] [Music] it is thought that the ancestors of the Shang people might have come from the ancient dongi nationality and that later they mingled with the HHA nationality in central China culturally the differences between the Shang people and the Shia people were not great in the spring of 1983 just 6 km from the AR to site archaeologists discovered the site of an ancient city with an area of more than 1.9 million square m this city dated to the early period of the Shang Dynasty 3,600 years ago was built near the capital of the Shia Dynasty it was built there in order to show the 3,000 or so smaller surrounding states that the Shang Dynasty lay at the center of the land in ancient times areas around the middle reaches of the Yellow River located in the center of China were known both as haia and the Central Plain after the founding of the Shia Dynasty the several thousand years of Chinese history that followed unfolded with haia and the central plane at the core the central plane became a political economic cultural and ideological furnace while the broad-minded people of the haia nation came to symbolize the strong power of cohesion and creativity of Chinese [Music] civilization as rule over the land was Consolidated and became increasingly stable the Shang Dynasty built an even larger Capital City 100 km east of yen today that city is referred to as the Shang city of Jango half a century ago archaeologists tried with limited success to reveal the secrets of the Shang City but then at the end of 1989 a farmer in Xiao Shang XA Village changjo dug up a bronze object clearly from the era of the Shang Dynasty that might have been fixed to a palace gate a huge wooden steak had once stood on the base of the stone stey and what it supported then would most likely have been the Palace of the Shang [Applause] [Music] [Laughter] Dynasty also found in the Shang city of Jango was China's earliest porcelain and it reveals that Shang people knew how to apply glaze to their Pottery they also knew how to use bronze and did so to create ritual vessels weapons and tools for use in daily life and for production purposes among the items excavated from the Shang city of Jango was a large bronze ding it is 1 meter in height and weighs 86 kg people today regard these large bronze ritual vessels as a testament to the Glorious achievements of the Shang Dynasty [Music] around the year 1300 BC King pangang of the Shang Dynasty moved the Dynasty's Capital City to Yin and Yin would remain the capital until the year 1046 BC the ruins of Yin were referred to by a later hand Dynasty historian but the location of the ruins was lost and remained a mystery for many hundreds of years but then at the end of the 19th century a farmer in sha toan Village in anang city hnan province dug up some animal bones known as dragon bones which he then sold to a drugstore because their value was far greater than his entire Harvest of grain for a year we don't know how many of these dragon bones were Ground into powder to be consumed as Chinese traditional medicine but it was not until the Autumn of 1899 that someone realized their true value that person was wangong at the time a well-known antiquarian and epigraphist while buying materials to be used in the preparation of some herbal medicines he noticed some symbols carved into the bones he was purchasing and at the symbol were very similar to inscriptions seen on items of bronze he immediately bought all the dragon bones the store had to offer and after carefully studying them he concluded that the symbols they bore were characters that were even older than those used in inscriptions on bronze articles the dragon bones were in fact Oracle bones from the Shang Dynasty era wangong had made a major Discovery and with it he became the first person to discover and collect Oracle bones dating in Back to the Shang [Music] Dynasty but just where had these Oracle bones kept secretly by dealers and such Antiquities for so long actually come from after years of Investigation another epigraph La Jen Yu guessed that the Oracle bones might have been Unearthed from shiau in the town of anang in hnan Province and so in the spring of 1915 La went to sha Tuan to carry out an investigation before long he realized that shaan was not only the place where the Oracle bones had been Unearthed but that it was also the site of the capital city of the Shang dasty what he had found was the yin ruins as referred to by hand dasty historians more than 2,000 years ago following La jenu famous scholar Wang gway carried out textual research on the names of the Shang Dynasty Kings and their lineage as recorded in saran's records of the historian he found that the records in saran's work agreed with the details CED on the Oracle bones and tortoise shells this proved that history records concerning the Shang Dynasty were surprisingly [Music] accurate Jo for the discovery of the yin ruins meant that a great gateway to the Shang Dynasty that had been closed for more than 3,000 years had been reopened but what kind of a world would be revealed as a [Music] result these are the famous Yin ruins located to the northwest of the city of enyang and hen Province over a period of 254 years Yin the capital city of Shang experienced the role of more than 12 Kings over eight generations and here the Palaces of those kings and their ancestral temples have been been discovered so far more than 70 sets of construction foundations have been found in the areas where the palace once stood and they have revealed that the Palaces of the city of Yin were more magnificent in terms of architecture than the Royal houses in the Shang dasty cities of yanu and Jang Jo they reveal the Striking achievements of the Shang people in what was a glorious time in China's Bronze Age [Music] the area of the yin ruin soof far revealed covers some 20 square kilm at present archaeologists are Excavating a road in the city dating back to the Shang dnasty this road was nearly 10 m wide big enough for four carriages running Side by by side today we can enter the halls of the city of Yin the capital city of the Shang Dynasty combining horses with cards was a great innovation in the history of human civilization and it was one that accelerated the course of human history the structure of a Shang Dynasty Chariot was very complicated and the art and craft of making one had reached Perfection to Kings princes and Aristocrats of the Shang Dynasty possessing a carriage symbolized Royal status and owning a fine Chariot was an name well worth pursuing this is the character for King when it appears in Oracle bone inscriptions it means the ruler of a country and it evolved from the character for battle ax at first the battle ax was used as a kind of practical weapon but later it became a ritual article so far no more than 10 bronze metal axes have been found at the Yen ruins and this indicates that only a few people could possess [Music] one Shang Dynasty troops were armed with what were at the time the best bronze weapons in the world they wore bronze helmets and they wore leather suits of armor thousands upon thousands of bronze weapons have been Unearthed from Shang tombs including various kinds of bronze daggers and sharp bronze Spears it seems that every adult male had to be prepared to be called upon at any moment to become a lionhearted fighter for the Shang Dynasty in 1976 Chinese archaeologists discovered a Shang dasty tomb which while not particularly large was highly important as it had never been looted inide were thousands of BU articles including some 468 items of bronze of various types and some of the types had never been seen before [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Laughter] [Music] after removing stains and rust marks from the bronze articles archaeologists could make out phrases this one reads s moin f how and how indicating the name of the same person fua was the wife of wooding King of the Shang Dynasty and her name appears as many as 250 times in Oracle inscriptions carved on Bones and tter [Music] shells up to now the tomb of fua is the only tomb of a Shang Dynasty royal family member found at the Yen ruins for which the occupant and his or her status can be confirmed and it also includes Oracle [Music] inscriptions not only was FHA highly involved in the state affairs of her era she was also China's first female [Music] General fuha is also believed to have been a beauty she had no less than 490 different hairpins enabling her to appear every day with a new face in front of King [Music] [Applause] [Music] Woodin no less than 755 arst of Jade have been Unearthed from the tomb of fuha and they include a jade bird Jade horse Jade tiger Jade Dragon and Jade Phoenix all of them are lifelike in appearance and reveal that the aristocrats of the era domesticated many pets including large animals such as the elephant and bear an elephant pit discovered at the Yen ruins contained a small elephant with a bronze Bell tied around its neck [Music] [Applause] just one kilometer from the Palace of the king and city of Yin there was a Shang dasty bronze Foundry that covered an area of 10,000 square m although numerous Craftsmen worked in The Foundry only the king himself could make decisions about the Dynasty's output of bronze the varieties of objects made and this scale Shang Dynasty Craftsman not only mastered the bronze making arts they had inherited from their ancestors but also developed a unque combination of pottery molds to make very large bronze vessels they pounded sunbaked clay into pieces and mixed this clay with fine sand that contained a large amount of quartz they then carved different designs on the clay and after drying the results became Pottery molds because each mold could be used only once no two bronze objects of the same design have ever been found at the yin ruin [Music] bronze objects were made by turning copper ore into molten copper which was then poured into a Potter object called a general helmet sometimes this object was used as a crucible such small-sized copper furnaces have remained in use to the present day the only difference being that today's furnace operators must wear a special face mask to protect themselves against the Heat as the temperature of molten copper reaches more than 1,200 de Centigrade the large simu W ding weighs 875 kg making it the largest object made of bronze excavated anywhere in the world [Laughter] [Music] [Laughter] to maintain a large-scale bronze Foundry great quantities of ore were needed the bronze articles Unearthed from the tomb of FHA Alone come to a combined weight of more than 1,600 kg requiring at least 8 tons of copper or however so far no Shang Dynasty Mining and smelting base has been found near the yin ruins and this leads us to wonder where the AE came from these beautiful small flowers called Hao xang Ru are also known as tungo grass which means copper rust grass they flourish on the SES of old copper mines this place more than 900 km from the yin ruins is located in today's Ru Chang City in Jang XI Province this lone wooden pole was erected by Shang people as part of the supporting frame of a mine more than 3,000 years ago evidence of the earliest Mining and smelting site in China tonglu Shan located in da City Hub Province to the northwest of Ru Chang is one of the six top copper bases in China here the Shang people built tunnels that led to underground mines and working underground the miners chose rocks bearing malachit sparkling with an emerald luster and had them sent up to the Surface by means of wooden tackle most of the copper resources needed to make articles of bronze for the Shang Capital probably originated from the tonglu Shan mine as the areas along the middle reaches of the yangi river possessed an abundance of such strategic resources the Shang dasty king would certainly have strengthened his control over this [Music] area fore [Music] it is recorded many times in the Oracle B inscriptions Unearthed from the Y ruins that the Shang Dynasty was once associated with Southwestern Shu which was far from Shang territory Shu was short for what is today's sit Chuan Province yet the state of Shu of ancient times is still wrapped in the Mist of History this place is called Sing what remains at sing is the remnants of an ancient city wall and the wall can be clearly seen to the ancient people of Shou the thick City wall and what had enclosed would have seemed like a fort today it ushers in groups of uninvited guests who have heard that someone knocked on the Gate of this wall and B it open to reveal the secrets of an ancient Kingdom [Music] in the summer of 1986 several workers were digging through the hard soil with their hose none of them having any idea that mixed in with the soil were cracked pieces of pottery broken bones and valuable objects of Jade soon no one was allowed to use the soil to make bricks and the entire block of land once part of the ancient state of Shu was under protection the gate to a mysterious Kingdom dating back more than 3,000 years was about to be opened in what would prove to be a truly Sensational Discovery when the ramed earth and the excavation pit was cleared away a miracle of archaeology was revealed Unearthed at s Shing were a large number of vessels made of gold the wealth of a King protected by troops of roaring tigers these tomb Guardians standing underground had fulfilled their duty to the kingdom more than 3,000 [Music] [Applause] years for the ancient and mysterious state of Shu had finally been found and just like the Shang Dynasty in central China it's had a highly developed bronze civilization but who had been the master of the ancient state of sha the people of sh had not left behind any written Clues this object which looks rather like a steering wheel gleams in its bronze Splendor legend hasard that the man who established the ancient state of Shore and became its first king was named tan Tong it is also said that he had protruding eyes and was actually called vertical eyes however people had never been able to imagine what these vertical eyes looked like until one day another Sensational Discovery was [Music] made is this the image of a person or an animal the appearance of this face mask May of bronze certainly startles everyone completely different in shape from those Unearthed from San Shing D it has eyes that protrude as much as 20 cm can this be the legendary tanong the ancestor of the sh people perhaps this is an image of tanong made to protect the state of sh he founded a state that became another Center of civilization far from Central China but if so what did the ancient people of sh use as the basis for this image of their great ancestor in spite of the fact that a great many Bronze Statues had already been excavated from the ancient state of Shaw the last find greatly surprised everyone a standing bronze figure 262 CM High such a huge bronze statue from this time had never been found in China or anywhere else in the world the figure wears a high hats and his clothes are decorated with dragon and Phoenix Designs and various animal mask designs but what was he holding so tightly in his hands he stands with bare feet on a square shaped platform that also Bears animal masks designs who can he be there's been surmised that this mysterious figure might well have been a king of the ancient state of Shaw [Music] also Unearthed from the San Ching du site were many articles in the shape of birds their elegant bodies reminding us of Phoenix's in the sky Legend has it that for several Generations the names of all sh kings were related to birds one of them was called youu or fish malard we know that in ancient times China's tribes took the Phoenix as their totem as the use of this totem has has also been seen in dwo culture and hu culture however ancient documents from the Central Plain claim that The Offspring of the kings of Shu were descendants of the yellow Emperor the great emperor of the Sha Dynasty if so then the two civilizations developed in parallel naturally people were greatly excited by the great sing D discoveries when this bronze tree appeared a crane and wooden frame had to be used to raise it into place although the tree is broken at the top it is still nearly 4 M high and archaeologists have called it a deity tree the base on which the tree stands looks like a mountain and the overall impression is that the tree growing out of the mountain is a Heavenly tree the trunk has three layers of branches from which hang fruit and various flying birds stand on the fruit in ancient sh people believed that high mountains and Big Trees were steps that led to the sky flying birds meanwhile were regarded as envoys coming and going between the Earth and Heaven passing information scholars believe that the bronze tree might represent F sang a place inhabited by the sun god certainly it would seem that at the very least the deity tree symbolizes the reverence accorded the Sun by The Shaw people [Music] so though fore [Music] the bronze Zen and bronze Le and other ritual vessels Unearthed from San shingu are very similar in shape and style to those from the Shang Dynasty on the Central Plain and clearly they originated from Shang [Music] culture dragons so often seen in other parts of China were also sacred in the minds of ancient sh people scholars believe these bronze zoan and bronze leay indicate that a courtesy system operated in the land of Shaw that there was a kind of peaceful cultural exchange with the Shang [Music] [Applause] [Music] Dynasty archaeologists believe that the large number of bronze items and ivory items Unearthed from San Shing du may have been left behind by the ancient people of Shu after some important ritual activity or sacrificial ceremony let's imagine such a sacrificial offering ceremony of the ancient Shu people more than 3,000 years ago the king is the chief diviner his very power comes from the people's faith in him large amounts of regional wealth are concentrated here and used as sacrificial offerings to ancestors and deities the sacred stateliness of it all amazes his people but in a raging fire the deity tree disappears and the King too vanishes eventually the ancient state of Shu also dies away and 300 years later the character for sure is found only on the Oracle bone inscriptions Unearthed from the Yen ruins the appearance of these Oracle Bon inscriptions marks the point at which China enters a period in the ancient past that can be verified through [Music] characters the Oracle B inscriptions of the yin ruins boast the earliest Chinese characters ever found and these characters appear in places where sacrificial activities were frequently held by Kings of the Shang Dynasty every day the Shan king would ask a fortune teller to foretell everything the weather the Harvest whether hunting would be good or whether there would be victory in battle all the for tellings that resulted from the reading of Omens were recorded on torto shells or on the shoulder blades of oxen and these became the state Archive of the Shang Dynasty the characters recorded on the toris shells and bones are referred to as Oracle bone [Music] [Music] inscriptions for [Music] [Music] [Music] the legend tongue J's invention of words familiar to all Chinese indicates that ancient Chinese people paid great attention to the origin of Chinese characters as written characters are an indicator of civilization the birth of characters announces the beginning of the history of human civiliz I ization as the Oracle inscriptions on toris shells and bones of the Yen ruins reveals Chinese characters originated before the Shang dasty the number of different words appearing in Oracle inscriptions on toris shells comes to more than 4,000 and so far at least 1,500 of these have been identified Scholars now believe that the number of characters used by Shang people exceeded 5,000 and perhaps numbered as many as 6,000 it was a logical and mature character system and as such it made an important contribution to both Chinese and World Civilization [Music] word character Beau Cal symbols used earlier on Pottery were later used to create Oracle bone inscriptions and inscriptions on bronze and these were followed by minuscule script Chinese official script and regular script all of them bearing Chinese characters which have been an important carrier of Chinese civilization soall Oracle bone inscriptions were also carved on toris shells but in fact during the Shang Dynasty in tools mainly consisted of brushes characters recorded at that time were written on bamboo slips using brushes to record official records unfortunately however as bamboo slips rot easily so far no standard books of the Shang Dynasty have been found but we can see from the Oracle bone inscriptions of the yin ruins that the characters used then were quite different from today's Chinese characters in terms of style that said there is no great difference in the method used to construct a character the Chinese character system is unique completely different from any other language in the world without doubt the invention of Oracle bone inscriptions was the greatest invention and creation of the Chinese Nation setting in motion the use of a character system that has lasted to the present [Music] day although the land of China is vast and a great variety of dialects are spoken from one end to the other its unique system of Chinese characters has enabled its people to access areas where different dialects Prevail the character system has also influenced the people's way of thinking and expression through literature maintaining the continuation of Chinese civilization and playing a highly important role in China's long-term unification "
