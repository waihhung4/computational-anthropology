"[music playing] NARRATOR: Guanghan\nCity, China, 1986. Construction workers\nunearth two sacrificial pits that contain the relics of\na long-lost civilization. The cache contains hundreds of\nbronze and gold masks, statues, and figurines, in addition\nto numerous marble and jade artifacts. Chinese historians\nconsider the discovery one of the most important\nfinds of the 20th century and date the site back\nbetween 3,000 and 5,000 years, to the very start of\nChinese civilization. Before the\nSanxingdui discovery, Chinese civilization\nwas understood to have arisen from\nthe Yellow River Basin, basically one spot in China. This discovery showed that\nthere were other very advanced cultures on the periphery\nof the Yellow River Basin that also heavily\ncontributed to the formation of Chinese civilization. JULIE LEE: Nobody wrote about\nthe culture at Sanxingdui. There's nothing that\ncomes up in Chinese texts, and the Chinese are very good\nat documenting their history. So one of the most\nsurprising things is how a culture that\nwas so sophisticated could slide under\nthe radar of history. NARRATOR: The Sanxingdui\nculture left no written record. No human remains\nhave been found. And according to\ntheir artifacts, they appear to have only\nexisted for 350 years. JULIE LEE: For some\nunknown reason, the artifacts were\nbroken, burned, and placed into two\npits and covered up, rendering them useless. So it's very curious as\nto why that happened. NARRATOR: Adding to the intrigue\nof the vanished civilization, they left behind dozens of\nbronze heads with odd features. On November 1, 2007, the\nofficial press agency of China asked the question whether or\nnot what we're looking at here are ancestors or, in\nfact, extraterrestrials. And my question is, what if\nwhat we have here is both? If you check out this one\nright here, look at the eyes. Now, why would any artisan carve\nor create something like this? Because our eyes\ndon't look like this. The whole thing is\nvery bizarre looking. It is not necessarily human. It is something else. The masks look very unusual. They have big ears, big eyes. They don't look like normal\nhuman beings of today. NARRATOR: Could it be that the\nmasks found at the Sanxingdui site are depicting ancient\nastronauts who visited our planet in the remote past? And if so, could\nthis help explain the abrupt disappearance\nof a seemingly advanced civilization? Ultimately, they\nvanish, and we don't know what happened to them. So were they some kind of\nextraterrestrial civilization or human hybrid civilization? "
