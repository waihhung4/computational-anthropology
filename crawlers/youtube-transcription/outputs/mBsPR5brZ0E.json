"okay let's talk about the Joe dynasty Joe dynasty is in China who would have thought and now if you notice the Joe dynasty is getting a little bit bigger than the shang dynasty and one thing you should also notice is that the Joe dynasty is still surrounding the Yellow River when the Yellow River looks like that yes it truly is yellow and now the significance of the river is that you know all early civilizations settled around rivers because that's where they got the water for the crops and the crops to eat and you know you got to eat to survive so rivers are pretty important the Joe dynasty ruled for a pretty long time a little bit longer than the showing dynasty they ruled from 1046 BC to 256 BC and that is almost 800 years one idea that came out of the Joe dynasty was this idea called the Mandate of Heaven and this happened a lot in the ancient world this is the idea where leaders claimed that they were the son of the gods and the gods basically told them that they could rule and how this works is if the leaders ruled the the people well then heaven allowed them to rule but if they didn't rule the people well then heaven would send all sorts of signs of displeasure such as floods and earthquakes feudalism is another idea that came out of the ja dynasty and now this is a system of a relationship between landowners and their tenants so here's how it worked you got the king who ruled the entire empire and that king gave land to his lords okay and his Lords would basically rule the land the Lord's in return would send soldiers to the king in order to protect in case of any sort of attack so the soldiers or vassals as they were known as protected the land these little guys down here they were the peasants okay they farmed the land okay and how feudalism works is the peasants gave a small portion of their crops up to the Lord and the Lord's would give some sort of payment to the king for being allowed to rule that land so really the king is the one who's benefiting from this system okay as they say it is good to be king now the show dynasty is also known for a bunch of philosophers to come out of those eight hundred years of rule it one philosopher was a guy by the name of Lao Tzu okay and he was the founder of Taoism and Taoists basically believed in achieving harmony with nature and being virtuous or good another handsome man to come out of this dynasty was Confucius the Confucius was the founder of Confucianism and basically the goal of Confucianism was a just and peaceful society and basically here's our work society worked well when all people acted properly based on their roles and relationships with others another man to come out of this dynasty was a man by the name of Han Fattah and he actually lived a few hundred years after Confucius and Lao Tzu this is towards the end of the Jo dynasty and he taught an idea called legalism and legalisms ideas were based on the idea that people were selfish and needed to have strict laws placed upon them now all good things must come to an end and here's how the show dynasty ended you see you got all these states during the Jo dynasty okay and these states don't get along and they happen to fight with each other this was called the warring States Period and like every fight somebody's going to come out on top as the most powerful and it just so happens that the winner was drumroll please thank you this guy the kingdom of chin okay so you'll learn more about him in a couple days and that's it here are some sources thanks for watching "
