"welcome back everyone today we're going to be looking at the history of the western SI Dynasty which was located right here in ninga uh it's a mysterious part of Chinese history and not many things remain well let's have a look at some of these amazing things that we have left the Western carved out its territory following the collapse of the Tang Dynasty in 907 lasting from 10:38 to 1227 the S Dynasty existed alongside the handled Song Dynasty to the South the kitan Le Leo Dynasty and the Leo Dynasty's eventual conquerors the jur and Jin Dynasty the Western s remains something of an enigma no standard history of the western s exists unlike the leao and the song and the fragments of the written language of the tanguts that do remain don't tell us a great deal either the Western sha was active between 1038 and 1227 and it controlled a huge part of what is today Northeast China ninia was where its was the the city of inan uh was the capital at the time named singing and it covered territory over Gansu Province some of shinjang Ching haai inner Mongolia even outou of Mongolia some of Northern shansi also U so it was you know was a legitimate Dynasty um carved out of the end of the Tang Dynasty let's talk about the pagodas for those who watch my channel you will know the pagodas do feature quite heavily and this is not only because I happen to think they're wonderful but also because they are more often than not the best remaining architectural features of China's history due to most being made of stone or brick no wooden buildings remain from the Western sead dusty but a handful of wonderful pagodas do albeit with a lot of renovation these twin pagodas in the hurand mountains are all that remain of what was once an area with hundreds of Buddhist temples they are both 13 story pagodas with the Western Pagoda reaching 41 m in height and the Eastern Pagoda a couple of meters shorter the pagodas have a mysterious history with no exact date and no written record of them at all set against the backdrop of these Barren mountains however they are as spectacular as any Pagoda you would hope to see in China another Pagoda connected to the Western SI is way out east of inan and locked up when I arrived luckily however a man with a key let me have a very quick look the Hong for Pagoda is although heavily restored Sublime the first emperor of the western sha was yho and his tomb along with the tombs of all of the other Western Shia Emperors are also right here in inan and they are very unusual let's have a look the Western SI tombs are just outside the city of inan at the foot of the hurand mountains nine Imperial tombs and hundreds of others remain so far only one tomb the largest has been excavated and it belongs to the founding emperor of the western SI lienal the Imperial tombs are surrounded by a square wall with a rammed Earth tomb inside they are unlike tombs from other dynasties adding to the mystery of the western SI the first Emperor's father and grandfather are also buried here but the final three Emperor tombs are possibly not here due to the sudden destruction of the western SI at the hands of the Mongols jumping back to the city the ninia museum in central inan has a great collection of Western Buddhist artifacts also there are a few of these really unusual Steely bases from the tombs these Northern dynasties the Western SI leao and the later Jin produce some of the most beautiful artwork you could imagine fascinating counterparts to the ultra developed Society of the hand dominated Song Dynasty in the s another wonder of the western SE can be found further south in linkia on the banks of the Yellow River as you can see it's pretty busy I just took a when I came you have you got to take like a little car here a Guang Guang sure they're called like a little sightseing car that was the only one on it truly unusual the 108 pagodas have been standing here for the best best part of a thousand years and have crumbled and been rebuilt throughout the dynasties okay there are 108 of them but it only adds one to my count right let's get going we can uh we can walk up to the top you can't actually walk in between all the pagodas but you can walk up the sides all the way to the top let's have a look I think ning is full of amazing history I with almost all Western SI remains it stands kind of alone outside of Modern urban centers and this I think is what makes these Western SE sites so great for the traveler so this place is incredibly unique there's nothing else like this anywhere in China um and it's been here sat on the banks of the Yellow River for Thousand Years in the UN Ming Ching denes had a lot of Renovations a lot of work done um but nevertheless kind of an unusual place um they're arrayed obviously in a pyramid kind of Tri sorry pyramid a triangle form um and every Row the number of pagodas in each row is an odd number obviously odd numbers in Buddhism are important and they're at 108 altogether also an important number in Buddhism the Western sh expanded to control the old Silk Road hery Corridor managing huge amounts of trade into China created a strong military and formed part of what was essentially a multi-state China so what exactly happened to it the Western sha lived amongst very powerful neighbors the Leo Dynasty the Song Dynasty later the Gin Dynasty and also the Mongols and for a while they uh they did quite well between these states there were numerous alliances and breakups Wars fought between them and uh at one point the Western SI and the Mongols were at war with the Jinn in 1225 the Western Shia made peace with the Jin however which caused a lot of problems with the leader of the Mongols that was Genghis or chingis Khan chingis Khan vowed to destroy the Western sha Dynasty completely and just two years later in 1227 the Mongol armies were laying Siege to the city of inan where I'm staying now while peace negotiations were underway the great Khan was in the south of this part of China in a place called guen in the lupan mountains where he died the great Khan known throughout the world chinis Khan died right here in ninga his death was kept a secret and negotiations continued in the capital eventually the Western sh bowing down to the Mongols who then s systematically annihilated them and their entire culture in what can only be described as ethnic cleansing Mass genocide the tangut people were so thoroughly wiped out that their entire culture was lost the language survived a little bit longer and eventually also faded Into Obscurity until the 20th century when people started to begin to translate fragments found in certain parts of China the actual name today used for this part of China ning xia has a reference to the old western Shia Dynasty the Shia being Shia ning meaning pacified the pacified in a country with perhaps the most complete written record of History the Western SE remains enigmatic and although it is likely more document evidence will surface which may answer more questions about the tangut dynasty at the moment we have to be simply content knowing a dynasty emerged in what is now ninga which rivaled all others of its time until the irresistible force of the Mongols swept away all in their path and that's all for this video If you enjoyed it like share and subscribe and I
