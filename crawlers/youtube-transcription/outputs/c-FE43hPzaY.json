"hello everyone\uff0c here is Refresh World Views By He sir Use science to interpret history Today we will focus on  the origin of Oracle bone inscriptions First of all, before we talk about the origin of oracle, we need to review  the process of the discovery of oracle You can watch some  documentaries about this, but  we won't go into details here. To put it simply,  around 1899, Mr. Wang Yirong found some   symbols similar to the ancient characters in the bones which using as herbal  medicine. And he was sure it was some ancient glyph Wang Yirong later committed suicide  during the Boxer Rebellion Well, well\uff0c Those The oralce bones went into Mr. Liu 'Er Liu Er\uff0cgot Wang's oralce bone inscriptions He publish a book , Tie Yun Cang Gui Later , Luo Zhenyu and some scholars have figued out some name of the kings of Shang dynasity, the Oracle bones were  identified  come from Shang Dynasty.  they are the character of Shang Dynasty. Because the names in the oracle bones  do have some records in the Records of the Historian You get to this Republican period 1910-1949 period One after another, books on  Oracle bone inscriptions appeared, like Yin Xu Shu Qi  and The Essence of Yin Xu Shu Qi from 1928 to1937 The famous archaeologist Dong Zuobin and Li Ji and Liang Siyong in An Yang area\uff0c Maken decade-long  archaeological discovery got 24,900 pieces of Oracle bones 24,900 pieces of Oracle bones and found the ruins of Shang Dynasty Royal Palace and Temples of worship In the Anyang area, not only the oracle bones were found,  but also the remains of this Shang Dynasty palace were indeed found  In this way, it is basically concluded that the oracle bone  is from the Shang Dynasty\uff0cand found the Relics of Shang Dynasty activities The city walls, the temple, all that stuff I won't go into the details of the story,  but you can find a documentary and watch them. or other stoies I think the story telling is so good and so vivid from the TV Lecture room experts so vivid\uff0cso good,  We're not going to  tell the story here I admire these experts, they tell stories very well very very well\uff0c Not only primary school students can understand it, but also college students Including some of the less literate  audience Can watch the  show show with relish I'm not as good as them in this respect The exact date of the Yin ruins  in Anyang is the time of  Around 1,300 BC. That means oracle bone inscription appeard in  that pariod.  Before that time, there are no evidents suppot that  writing system existed in central China  and The An Yang area the first chinese writing system  After the earliest writing appeared in   in the Middle East and North Africa   it had taken nearly 2000 years that writing system  appeared in China oracle bone inscription  the earliest chinese writing system\uff0c appeard 2000 years later than ancient Egypt and Sumer 1500-2000 years, it is a long priod another  question is  before 1300BC Did the legendary Xia Dynasty existed ? Erlitou ruins and Zhengzhou Shang city ruin  Yanshi Shang city ruin At none of these sites  did oracle bones appear The Oracle bones in the ruins of  Yin Xu are the earliest (1300 BC) No bones have been found  anywhere earlier.  No writing system has been found earlyer than this period We just mentioned this in the so-called  early Shang Dynasty site before An yang No oracle-bone inscriptions were unearthed It is said that there is an oracle bone with characters  in the Shang Dynasty site in Zhengzhou but that piece of oracle bone Some are of unknown origin and\uff0cThe famous oracle bone inscriptions expert  Ken-ichi Takashima, who belive that  that piece of oracle bone could not early than  later periof of Shang Dynasty It could even be from the final decades  of Shang Dynasty Indeed, from the present point of view,  none of the Oracle bones can be determined to be before this ruins (1300 BC) Basically now we can To conclude it After removing  unverifiable evidence conclude that  oracle bone inscription  apeard after 1300BC It's the only possibility No exceptions The so-called early writing systems are  not credible This division of the early Shang Dynasty  sites may be problematic Ah, and what's more,  even if there's a problem Not only are there no writing,   but there are no chariots or horses The important features of the Shang Dynasty are bronze, chariots and writing What if there were only bronzes found  It's not enough to say that these sites must belong to the Shang Dynasty Throughout the history of the development of writing Basically, there was a blueprint for most  of writing systems which \n \n144\n00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,466\nsuddenly emerged For example, we see in writing system of  Tangut, Japanese and Korean Including the Manchu  writing system These characters have a blueprint  that is, they have a system to learn from Before we get to the bones,  we have to discuss the  lineage of the Shang Kings Ancient Kings are often mentioned  in oracle inscriptions Ancient Kings some Kings\u2018 name do appear in the Records of the Grand Historian Siu Tun (Site) Siu Tun\uff0c The site is basically  in line with what the which said in  Records of the Grand Historian That's why this place is called Yin Ruins But, we see the contrast  between the site and these so-called  records of the former Kings The records of these  former Kings are still questionable For example, Wang Guowei Compare oracle bone inscription record with the book of Records of the Grand Historian It seems to confirm  in  the Yin history Records of the Grand Historian However, there is no archaeological evidence   to support the activity of the former kings.  In particular, we're going to see that in terms of archaeology The Shang Dynasty was a  very nomadic dynasty The Shang Dynasty was the earliest dynasty  that had horse-drawn carriages and  horses There are no traces of horses and carriages  in any archaeological sites before the Shang Dynasty before the Shang Dynasty  An Yong site \uff081300BC\uff09 no horse no chariot \uff0cbefore 1300BC According to Records of the Grand Historian, one of the earliest former Kings was named Wanghai He was an expert herder of horses and cattle, apparently the leader of a nomadic people He was a master herder of horses and cattle  and as king he must have  come from a nomadic people not a leader of a farming people farming people If these stories of cattle and  horses were true, there must be  a lot of horses and cattle left behind If there really were a large number of cattle and horses in that period then it is impossible that no archaeological remains  have been found at all\uff0c becsuse we know The ruins before the Shang Dynasty just like Long Shan culture Er li Tou  culture there found a lot of animal remains but no horse no cattle at all Historical research has now established  that horse domestication came from Central Asia Horses are not our native domesticated animals When we talk about the domestication of animals,  we will talk specifically about horses Let's talk about the horse in advance now Horses are not our native domesticated animals Even our bronze technology was introduced  from West Asia Bronze metallurgy is not an independent  technology developed in China Metallurgy came here  from Western Asia These archaeological records show that Even if the things about the ancestors of  the Shang Kings in the Records of the  Grand Historian are true That ancestor most likely  did not  live in  modern central China The Shang Kings  probably  migrated from Central Asia At some point The tribes of the Shang King  migrated into the Central china This shows that the ancestors  of the Shang king were not  local people Archaeological evidence suggests that  the Shang Dynasty appeared suddenly in central China A dynasty sprang up in the Central China   It is clear that the historian Mr. Wang Guowei is wrong\uff0cbecause he  Disregard the changing circumstances He took it for granted that   the former Shang Kings  also lived in Anyang but the former kings maybe  do have developed horse and cattle farming But the archaeological evidence only  supports that they came  from somewhere else Given the current characteristics of   the Shang dynasty, they should have come from the big steppe of Central Asia Of course, in Wang Guowei's time,  he had less information than now and less understand to Shang Danasty  There is also much less  archaeological data,  It is also because Wang Guowei  believes that  almost all historical records are true That's what I was taught  as a child Especially after the Shang Dynasty People believe that the ancient stories  recorded in history books are true. Including the affairs of Kings and ministers or how to rule a kingdom There is a huge contrast between  these vivid stories   and the real archaeological evidence Additional evidence comes from  American  historian Kwang-chih Chang In his book on the Shang Dynasty He discovered the hereditary  system of the Shang Dynasty This is a marked difference  from subsequent dynasties The hereditary  system of Shang Dynasty is Agnatic seniority. This is often seen in  the inheritance system of nomads  where the order of succession to the throne  prefers the monarch's younger brother  over the monarch's own sons.  Rules of succession is  The throne basically passed to   his youngest brother, as was common  among the nomads This rule of succession is obviously  different from the succession danastys\u2018 father-son succession system The above evidence shows that first of all,  there was no writing before the  appearance of inscriptions and second,  the Shang Dynasty may have come from the migration of people in Central Asia  or conquest of those people It was a nomadic dynasty. At least his top nobles  were from the nomads maybe from Central Asia  \u8fd9\u91cc\u5462\u6211\u4eec So we're  not going to go into detail here Let's go back to the origin of  the Oracle bone inscriptions It's ancient and writting system  The method of writing and  the system of symbols By analyzing them We can basically figure out that  the oracle bone inscriptions are mainly derived from symbols in Western Asia,  mainly from Sumeria The Sumerian antecedent writing system  had a very direct influence on the sign  system of oracle bones inscriptions There are a lot of influences on this Now what I'm going to talk about is  this question that I'm going to talk about I wrote a paper on this in 2017 the paper\u2019s name is  The evidences about that oracle bone scripts derived from ancient Sumerian proto cuneiform script and the reinterpretation of  oracle bone scripts with the basic symbols of  proto cuneiform you can download in OSF  OSF https://osf.io/dm3gv/ https://osf.io/dm3gv/ https://osf.io/dm3gv/ https://osf.io/dm3gv/ https://osf.io/dm3gv/ OSF is a  preprint websit First of all, let's explain the title  is:  The evidences about that  oracle bone scripts derived from  ancient Sumerian proto cuneiform and the reinterpretation  what that means?  let's say it metaphorically a big river , YangTze  Yangtze's  upstream is the Jinsha River Is there any other river besides Jinsha River of cause there are a lot of revers One of the tributay is the Jinsha River But there are many tributaries all these tributaries is  origin of Yangtze I said oracle bone script  \n361\n00:16:19,266 --> 00:16:22,566\nwitch derived from proto cuneiform I mean proto cuneiform just one of tributaries is there other writting systems  influnced Oracle bone script? Maybe have some. Maybe. Not a lot We're looking at it now uh For example, did the Egyptian \n368\n00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,933\nhieroglyphics have an effect? Maybe a little Now, this may seem strange to people but if you know the history of the world   we'll see that it's not so strange, right like, This Western phonetic script,  26 letters a lot of the letters  come from this Egyptian hieroglyphics some of them, came from  glyph of proto cuneiform This is actually a very common in history of writing systems It's a process of communication As a later writing system, it did not  necessarily limit itself to choosing symbols  in one writing system. Like Korean and Japanese characters they all absorb elements and methods   from chinese characters and phonetic characters like Mongolian script The feature of some phonic characters As a later writing system, it would certainly have learned from the surrounding text  that already existed At the same time, these later writing systems must have favored  one or two major writing systems in the surrounding area I say  derivered  means : had learnd  something at the beganing When writing system is in the  pictographic stage The evolution of writing is  from pictographic  to simplified and then to abstract abstract  early cuneiform inscription lies  between pictographic and abstract Some symbols can also  clearly  show the depicted object Abstract symbols are  even more difficult for  other cultures to understand  The transition of these symbols   from pictographic to abstract has left traces in the glyphs meanwhile, the proto cuneiform symbols  also spread in the surrounding Middle East and North Africa Some phonetic letters also  come from these symbols at that time And the Middle East   had not only phonics but also ideograms All the symbols and methods are circulating in the Middle East Knowing what these basic symbols mean  will not only help us to understand  the origin of Oracle bone scribes but also help us to solve  some of the unsolved problems of  oracle scribe  If we introduce the meanings  of these basic symbols of proto cuneiform into the interpretation of the oracle script some of the tortoise shell inscriptions that have long puzzled paleographers can be well explained So it is very important for us to study Oracle bone script now it is important The matter of the origin of cracle bone scripts  have been argued for long time Before the appearance of cracle bone scripts various types of pottery symbols were unearthed all over China As writing, oracle bone script appeared suddenly We made this very clear in the  early stage those pottery symbols couldn't directly evolved to the later oracle bone scripts. Those symbols are not words About the origin of Oracle bone inscriptions long ago Some scholars have long argued that Chinese civilization was introduced from the West.   In 1894, Terriende Lacouperie,  a French born Englishman wrote a story about the origin of Chinese civilization The Western Origin of Ancient Chinese Civilization He believed that the ancestors of the Chinese people of the Chinese people were originally Babylonians \u56fd\u4e0a\u53e4\u6587\u660e\u7684\u897f\u65b9\u8d77\u6e90\u554a\u8fd9\u4e2a this statement lines  composition is too much it were lack of substantial evidence Even by the standards of that time it just was   an interesting story Far-fetched like a drama. so it has never been  recognized by academic circles time to 1913 Oxford University press published  C.J. Ball\u2019s work Chinese and Sumerian He began by comparing Chinese  characters with  Sumerian cuneiform he belived that  chinese characters derivered  sumerian cuneiform Because first of all both are this ideogram he found some similarity But there is a big difference between  modern Chinese characters and Sumerian characters The work lacks persuasion Today's Chinese characters are abstracted characters The Chinese characters he compared  were obviously too abstract obviously too abstract This makes the comparison of the two lacking substantial evidence So, few scholars  do recognize  his conclusion  that Chinese writing system were evolved from Sumerian cuneiform. But now  C.G. bell , his work seems  to be very meaningful Although academics  did not accept his conclusions recent years,  China  Some important works have been  published by Chinese scholars of West Asia like Gong Yushu, Yan Haiying,  Ge Huiying In 2009, they  make a lot of study on  comparing  three ancient writing systems, Egyptian hieroglyphics, cuneiform and  oracle bone script Co-published this comparative  study of the three acient scripts The book really   had a big impact in China  the comparative study of a large number of  character Through those study,  Chinese scholars had further  understanding about ancient writing systems ancient writing systems and how these  ancient writing systems evoluted In these studies,  Some of these studies  are very inspiring to me It was only with their research that I began to notice the origin of  oracle bones inscription Gradually, I began to tease out the  the relationship between  oracle bone inscriptions and  proto cuneiform By comparing the basic symbols,  I found some  deep connections between the two writing system Before we talk about these symbols, it's worth discussing  a very serious point the point is methodology  that means how we can get the conclusion By what means can a conclusion be reached there are two parts here firsr , we will discuss the principle about graphic evolution first we know that before \n552\n00:24:19,766 --> 00:24:20,766\nwriting system apreard use graphics to recored is normal the graphic evolution en en The process of gradual simplification, but oracle  bone inscription  Seems to exist at the end of evolution The symbols of more than half of the oracle bones have been completely abstracted So when we want to compare will  find some of different between early syembols and  later syembols the same meaning hieroglyphics oracle bone glyphs look much simple than others And this is a basic trend that we see is that The basic graphic syembols is   going to look less and less simple  and simplification less and less, complex pictograms are reduced to abstract symbols  that are easy to write writing  became  easier and easier Changes in writing tools made glyphs There has also been a corresponding change for example , a same glyph  When using a triangular nib in clay tablets because triangular nib triangular nib the line  The lines are not  easy to bend curve became less and less make writer to use a straight line to combine into a graphic let's see \n596\n00:25:53,566 --> 00:25:55,200\nthe pen of cuneiform The pen is the tip of the reed  with triangular nib It can write wedge shapes on clay tablets the read pen little like  chinese carving knife The front end is triangular This kind of knife is very  difficult to turn and make curve This straight line is very easy so This pen tends to write in straight lines it could turn some rectangles  or circles into a triangle symbol or square symbol that means tools And they changed their writing accordingly and changed symbols' looks The way characters are written is critical factors when the glyphs turn to  straight line  that hard to found something valueble so wo have to limite the comparation between proto cuneiform and oracle bone script Before it's completely out of the pictograph Compare them with our oracle bone inscriptions en The other problem is probability before probability, we know that  if we want to judge   the correlation between the two things  there are  We need to understand that   there is the possibility of repetition  in the form of some simple symbols like square\uff0ccircle\uff0ccross but the symbol and meaning   are corresponding to match  match shape and  meaning  the probability of this situation is very low  is very low.  If there are  many of these cases  in both writing systems,  even the shape and the meaning correspond, the probability of this happening by chance is low  to near zero the probability of   having the same chance  decreases geometrically with each chance.   It's just like the  the double color ball lottery  where the probability of having  the same answers geometrically decreased every time the  numbers match up with the colors. very low probability It was very difficult. We matched seven  or eight balls match the number and color Red balls and green balls make it harder if you match 5 it is 1/1,000,000 probability If two writing systems  have many basic symbols match their shape corespond  match their  meanning And that's when we think,  it  didn't be by accident this principle that we emphasize In reality, many low probability events  are inevitable events A very low probability event is one that is not accidental  but deliberate  for example  if a paternity test has  a 99.99 %  chance of being related about kinship That is to say the two of them might  be father and son\uff0c But what else There's a 0.01% chance he's not \u4e5f\u5c31\u662f What if you insist on putting 0.01 odds As a discussion No event in history can be concluded And it's actually true in real life As a paternity test the result Basically, more than 99% is OK but\uff0c if someone insist deneys that result he can deny it but the court will this is the reality situation A judgment on this historical question It's true that our history can't be 100% but\uff0c if we got a 99% anwser Or 99.99% of the time it's a pretty solid piece of evidence That is to say we need to look at t this problem in terms of probabilities In addition,  I would like to state that  most of the meanings mentioned below are not my own opinions, but from authoritative dictionaries like Oracle Bone Inscriptions Dictionary by Xu ZhongShu the meaning of cuneiform reference to University of Pennsylvania's ePSD  The Pennsylvania  Sumerian Dictionary EPSD  http://psd.museum.upenn.edu/nepsd-frame.html http://psd.museum.upenn.edu/nepsd-frame.html you can check the meaning in this site Objectivity Just to emphasize, all of meaning  Try to be objective Except for this oracle character There is no credible  implication yet, or I think clearly wrong I introduced the cuneiform meaning of this glyph by comparison. there are just 2 glyphs  in paper the method like a function, put a meanning in to a glyph, and check the meaning in sentence if most of the sentence are resonable the meanning is acceptable In most cases,   a symbol has an exact meaning  in both  cuneiform and oracle bone inscriptions I don't  invent a meaning for myself This ensures the objectivity  of our comparison Ah, let's look at one next  cuneiform's  evolution there are a evolution principle  in writing systems left is proto cuneiform middle is linear A script Linear A existed in 1,600BC-1,000BC around  1,600BC that scipt used  in Greece in that time  Linear B  Had been interpreted  they are very close relation They are Greek for this type of writing in this table we look glyph of person It looks like a mummy in the proto cuneiform that indicated a person to the time of linear A linear A scripit is at least  300 years early than oracle inscription linear A  glyph  like a man in walking then came to the time of oracle bone inscription the person glyph simplified just two strokes ,that depict a sideview of person  Much simpler, Ah, let's do one more. \n765\n00:33:03,866 --> 00:33:06,400\nthe glyph of goat Since the goat in the proto cuneiform  is an abstract symbol we use a similar symbol instead.  we use a  fox glyph this glyph is outline type  graphic ,  look like Stick figure 1000 years later in linear A script  linear A script  the glyph became a linear type symbol,  just emphersized the  features of goat ,  its horn The bottom half, it becomes  a vertical and two horizontal lines The vertical and horizontal shapes   probably come from the goat's very long facial features it is already  very abstractive in oracle bone inscription,  the goat glyph upside part is  as same as coresponding in  linear A  Now, scholars believe that the  linear A writing system may be influenced by  both ancient Egyptian hieriogrphic  glyphs and ancient Sumerian  cuneiform glyphs one came from Egypt another came from proto cuneiform because Greece located west of  the Mediterranean Sea Sitting between two civilizations,  borrowed a lot  at the same time But these symbols have been greatly  simplified in the writing process Throughout the various writing system in the process from simple strokes to abstractions oracle script nearly in the final stage If we compare similar glyphs. We're going to eliminate some of the influences\n810\n00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:41,400\nwhich caused by outline and linear Fortunately, there are rules  for outline graph turns to  linear graph This question comes up occasionally Now, Let's look at some of this main evidence ah Well let's talk about it briefly The first is this glyph \"tian , \u7530\" for \u201c\u7530\uff0ctian\u201d glyph it is a high frequency glyph in the inscriptions The modern sense of the word. Fields  do not appear very frequently in oracle bones the highest frequenc meaning of the glyph is  is to hunt ( \u7530\u730e tianlie )  The most common phrase is king hunts in somewhere king he go to hunt? others like:  if king go to hunt that is good luck? Shuo Wen Jie Zi Li, A Han Dynasty etymology book ancient sript : \u7530\uff0c\u9635\u4e5f\uff0c\u6811\u8c37\u66f0\u7530\uff0c \u8c61\u56db\u53e3\u5341\uff0c \u9621\u964c\u4e4b\u5236\u4e5f\u3002 It means that the eyology of \u7530 Tian  comes from the grid shape of the ancient cultivated land lattice look First of all, the shape of the cultivated land  is more elongated look  like comb \uff0c Latticed fields are rarely seen Even though the exterior outline is square,   the interior is full of vertical lines of cultivation Well field system, the first concept is appeard in the spring and autumn period \uff088-4 century BC\uff09 500 years later well field system The complicated discussion of  Chinese history is omitted here omitted here omitted here omitted here omitted here omitted here omitted here omitted here omitted here omitted here The Oracle Bone Inscriptions Compilation NO\uff1a0001 Transliteration\uff1a\uff08\u738b\uff09\u5927\u4ee4\u4f17\u4eba\u66f0\uff0c\u534f\u7530\uff0c\u5176\uff08\u53d7\uff09\u5e74\u3002  what the meaning of \u201cxie tian\uff0c\u534f\u7530\u201d Help with the farming\uff1f got harvest\uff1f Getting a good harvest  and farmland seems reasonable However, it was impossible for   the Shang aristocrats to farm They were slave owners they won\u2018t Cultivate the land by themselves Historians generally believe that  the Shang Dynasty was a very cruel  and tyrannical dynasty Their nobles worked with slaves It was impossible for the aristocrats  themselves to work with slaves  in inferior labor another We saw a saying  about Tian\uff0c is \u201dtian \u7530\u201c ralate to man\uff0c because cultivating labors  relay on men means \u201cfield times labor\u201d but  in fact there are  Lack of clear evidence which \u201c\u7537\uff0cnan\u201d  can explain as man  in Oracle bone script script in the Oracle Bone Dictionary only meaning of \u201c\u7537\uff0cnan\u201d is It's a kind of title how can a title related with  field? cultivating man couldn't had a title in that time nobles didnot cultivate and we talked above we  know  Shang is a strong sense of  nomadic ethnic group why \"\u7530\uff0ctian\" means hunting We don't see any credible evidence Xu Zhongshu's Oracle Bone  Dictionary explains it this way That's far-fetched The ancient text is omitted here The ancient text is omitted here The ancient text is omitted here The ancient text is omitted here The ancient text is omitted here Xu Zhongshu explain that nobles hunting  with lattice like troops that is impossible No anthropologist has ever  documented such a hunt  all over the world what is the etymology of \u201ctian\uff0c\u7530\u201d hunting line can not  got lattice look and no such record no one have seen such thing The Shang Dynasty belongs to  fisrt stage after prehistoric  period  There's no such thing as a lattice hunt That time is a very low  population density that impossible Hunting is three sides at most lattice impossible there had lines to hunt  lattice hunting is impossible It's not a hunt. It's a sweep There's no need for that  don't have the manpower  in 1300BC  so many people cann't hunting  when they were gethering most animals  run away human move slow  when they line \uff0cthey move  slower  that period had not riding equipment people couldn't ride horse By analyzing this bizarre explanation we still don't know what is  this glyph\u2019s etymology because the glyph is so  abstractive\uff0c Xu zhongshu\u2018s explaination It's just an ancient  conjecture in fact no such hunting had  been recorded lattice hunting  no recording in other cultures There's not even an anthropological  record to back it up why Oracle Bone Dictionary and the book, Shuo Wen  Jie Zi It is acknowledged that Tian's original  intention was to hunt but  they  cann't figure out \"\u7530\uff0ctian\" etymology At the same time, hunting is  also the most frequent meaning why\uff1f  proto cuneiform give us a clue Let's look at this symbol  in  proto cuneiform This led to the first connection  between the two writing system in proto cuneiform this symbol  represent  sheep or goat Because sheep  is one of the main traded goods so In Mesopotamia The merchant in the beginning maybe draw a sheep\uff0cbut Sheep appear very frequently  The original picture was replaced  by an abstract symbol to represent sheep so Whether it's sheep domesticated sheep or wild sheep The symbol slowly became associated  with the animals and preys slowly Derived the meaning of livestock and prey and On the other hand Goats and antelopes are also the  most common prey most common prey As the word slowly evolved,  it changed from  sheep to prey and  finally become a verb  to hunt Over 1,000 years of  slow evolution we now can see \u7530\uff0cTian\u2019s etymology is prey or livestock prey Noun verbalization become \u201cto hunt\u201d other evidences support this etymology are coming from some other inscriptions of Oracle For example, we are the most common word \u201c\u755c\uff0c\u5f90\uff0cmeans livestock\u201d Our most common word in modern It goes back a long way This word belongs to riddle writing above is rope below is a prey Can you imagine what it looks like? rope lead a prey It's very simple Clearly recognize that it's a rope above tie a prey or prey tied to a rope means livestoke in oracle bone inscription Some of these glyph have little  dots next to them Sometimes it means Sweating or bleeding or  bodily fluids what that mean What do these fluids represent these little dots mean what do this mean\uff1f Sheep and cows both produce milk produce milk the glyph \u201c\u755c\uff0c xu\u201d Droplets indicate they may be able  to produce milk this glyph sometime  with dots some time no dot there was a clear way to combine a rope and a prey  to creat a new meaning livestock\uff0c this method is also known as joint ideogram  or associative compounds another example is glyph \u201c\u7540\uff0cbi\u201d above part is \u201c\u7530\uff0ctian\u201d below part is a pair of hand \u201d\u7540\uff0cbi\u201c have Two ways to write it another way is same above below is a arrow It's a symbolic device  an arrow penetrating the prey. Later came the meaning  of giving prey to  someone\uff0cgot \uff08 a prey\uff09 hunted a prey and the glyph \u201c\u66fe\uff0c zeng\u201d below part is \u201c\u7530\uff0ctian\u201d above part is \u201c\u5206\uff0cfen\u201d two stroke that represent divide something divide times prey what\u2019s that means\uff1f that a riddle mean a kind of  sacrifice performed cut cattle. or sheep\uff0c the glyph \u201c\u66fe zeng\u201d in the Oracle Bone Inscriptions Dictionary also interpreted  One of the sacrifice or a man whose duty is dividing prey  more\uff0cthe glyph \u201c\u4e43\uff0c nai\u201d  of Oracle inscription Now let's look at this The original way of writing  milk characters above is tian\uff0c\u7530\uff0c that meand sheep or other livestock  Below is a bowl for receiving milk there are a  livestock and a bowl This is a very clear representation of  milk\uff0c later animal milk rebus to a pronouns something as a function words Here we see that most of the  characters associated with tian \u7530 are related to livestock  or prey or sheep and so on by these joint ideograms\uff0c we  could  comfirm that  the \u201c\u7530\u201d was not represent field.  you cann\u2018t  tie field but you can tie a livestock tie a prey that present livestocks is in  a very vivid way. As we often see with  cattle  tied by a rope and sheep also were tied by rope like we tie our dog \u66fe\uff0czeng\uff0cthe glyph means  divide a sacrifice prey or livestock in fact it represent a preist these is clear further information could be check in the Oracle Bone Inscriptions Dictionary and more detail read  the coresponding entries  one by one\uff0cI'm not going to talk about  it because of time constraints It is also worth noting that  some of the characters  in the oracle bone  scripts are rectangles,  divided into  six or more small squares. this glyph may related to another proto cuneiform glyph \u201cgan\u201d \uff08feild\uff09 These characters need to  be carefully screened many of them may . represent cultivated land Fortunately, these symbols are  few and far between the second glyph let\u2019s look  etymology of \u201czhen \u8d1e\u201d this glyph are the most frequent glyph  in Oracle bone inscriptions The most common traditional misinterpretation is  \u201c\u8d1e\u201d and \u201c \u9f0e\uff0cmeans a tripod \u201d are considered to be same  This is an easily verifiable mistake.  For example,  on the obverse of  the no: 3171 \uff0cthe Oracle Bone Collection, in obverse\uff0c there are two characters of \u201czhen\u201d and \u201cDing\u201d on.   If they are the  same character, it is impossible for the writer to write two characters on one piece of oracle bone. it doesn't mean two ways to write a word one day someone used this way in a piece of Bone other day other uesd another way this evident suggest that they are two different words  on other side\uff0c the glyph  zhen \u8d1e It's usually used at the beginning of a sentence like \uff1a king big \u201dzhen\u201c big zhen\uff0cthat mean king had a good luck zhen\uff0c\u8d1e usually mean good result\uff0cor result In the ancient Chinese divination book  Zhouyi, this character also means excellent that means in Zhouyi this character is a adjective word discribe a good luck Since this word means an adjective Describe the good of the event so this glyph mean good result this glyph impossible to represent a preist a witch or some duty workers and we know this glyph also didn't represent a tripod bioler what is the etymology of the   glyph of \"zhen, \u8d1e\u201d the Oracle Bone Inscriptions Dictionary did not give an answer  it's definitely not the tripod bioler When I was comparing the two writing systems I found this in proto cuneiform the glyph \"uzud, or ud5\" What does that mean it is means nanny sheep represent a Suckling ewe A lactating ewe 2 triangles under the \u201c\u7530\u201d glyph  represent the sagging udders of the ewe. \u7530 means sheep\uff0c udu There is reason to believe that ewe  had a very good meaning  in ancient times, because giving birth to  a lamb meant increasing wealth Very lucky because of  increased wealth So it must have a very nice meaning the triangles  represent the  sagging udders of the ewe. This evolved into the  adjective of good results this glyph had been further simplified in evolution one side of triangle combined with one side of \u7530 There were originally two triangles  drawn under a \u7530 and same change in other  side and the graph \u7530 changed to  graph \u76ee finally we can see in early stage cuneiform  ud5 ud5 this cuneiform glyph apeard 2500BC a new glyph There are some changes to the top of the \u7530 There was a vertical vertical the stroke was out form \u7530 looks more like  cuneiform and some  small change Now let's look at this pronunciation also have some chang that time 2,500 BC conquerer Akkadian, what's the start to Occupy the area There is a change in speech We see this symbol is  evolved from the ewe  glyph  at this  we look back to  oracle bone  glyph of \u201c\u8d1e \uff0czhen\u201d A very clear feature is a long straight line  on both sides and 2 triangle below There's a horizon in the middle Oracle bone inscription turn above vertical into 2 triangle it is  One of this evolution  in the process of propagation The more  write,  the more deformed  After all, the two symbols  are 1,200 years apart In 1,200 years' time Changes like this are   acceptable So that's what we know \u201dzhen \u8d1e\u201c glyph\u2018s etymology is A pregnant ewe or Suckling ewe it could be a adjective in other hand Modern Chinese, on the contrary, retains its very old meaning \u201d\u8d1e\u64cd\uff0cvirginity\u201c it\u2019s related to pregnancy or sex activities why name it \u201dzhen \u8d1e\u201c a woman pregnant related chastity the woman who was only having sex with  the person you are married to; why\uff1f We talked about why is it important  for women to get pregnant According to the theory of offspring  investment in psychology husbands invest heavily in their wives and children If you raise a child  that's not your own The loss is great for him very sad mistake\uff0cso meaning of \u201czhen \u8d1e\u201d the core of meaning is pregnancy well here we compared two glyph correspondly Oracle bone inscription and proto cuneiform See the similarities And what we also found after this comparison They are not only similar to each other but also restore our original  intention in this oracle bone script for example\uff0c\u201dzhen \u8d1e\u201c means nanny ewe or pregnant ewe The pregnancy thing,  he's gonna make a nice thing  Of course, pregnancy has a lot of uncertainty so It occupies a very important place in divination Now let's look at the third word the glyph is \u201cshi \u5e08\u201d In the oracle bones inscriptions this glyph use a symbel of \u201cbow\u201d Historically, there have been many explanations Some say it looks like a hill Some say it even looks like the ass This is nonsense, of course Only Mr. Luo Zhenyu accurately  interpreted the original  meaning of this character for example\uff0cOracle Bone Inscriptions Collection NO\uff1a3306 wang zuo shan shi zuo zhong you\nking  raise three troop \uff0c left\uff0cmiddle\uff0cright the other explanations doesn't make any sense king made three hill three ass\uff1f only the meaning of troop is right king made three troop This is very clear So what's the problem here have a bow to represent the army That is a reasonable explanation, too But let's look at the cuneiform symbol for the army.  What does it look like we see in proto cuneiform the glyph of army also did be a bow a bow represent army In the Bronze Age army had plenty  types of weapons gow\uff0cspear\uff0cknife\uff0cchariot\uff0cshield\uff0c etc Why 2,000 years apart 1500-2000 years apart use the symbol of \u201cbow\u201d to represent army or troop It's a low probability event low probability Nor is it likely to  be a coincidence most  impotent weapon of Shang Dynasty is Chariot Archaeological data,  the main infantry weapon  is the gow \uff08dagger\uff09 The two are matched by a bow  This is no accident This only proves that  there is a necessary  connection between them well\uff0c today Today I'm going to do three\uff0cNext,  we have a dozen more examples For reasons of time,  that's all we'll talk about today I'm going to show the rest of the dozen glyphs \uff0cand evidences here is Refresh World Views By He sir Using science to interpret history Welcome, everyone.
