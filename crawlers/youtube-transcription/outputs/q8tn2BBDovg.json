"If we are going to study world history, then let\u2019s\u00a0\nstart our journey all the way at the beginning.\u00a0\u00a0 But where, or rather when, is the beginning?\u00a0\nWe don\u2019t have a magic mirror to peer into\u00a0\u00a0 the past. In order to learn about a historical\u00a0\nperiod we need something physical to examine,\u00a0\u00a0 so we can start by discussing the earliest known\u00a0\ncivilization, meaning the first civilization to\u00a0\u00a0 leave behind enough artifacts that\u00a0\nwe can know many things about them.\u00a0 The region that was called Kengir by its\u00a0\ninhabitants, though we know of it today as Sumer,\u00a0\u00a0 was one of the first agricultural civilizations,\u00a0\nand one of the first civilizations in the world\u00a0\u00a0 in general, in the literal sense of a culture\u00a0\nof cities. The plains of southern Mesopotamia,\u00a0\u00a0 the region between the Tigris and Euphrates\u00a0\nrivers, were occupied from the 5th millennium\u00a0\u00a0 BCE and into the 4th by a group of city-states\u00a0\nwith names like Uruk, Kish, Lagash, and Ur, the\u00a0\u00a0 last of which is mentioned in the Book of Genesis\u00a0\nas the birthplace of Abraham. Though inhabitants\u00a0\u00a0 of Mesopotamia in that time were Semitic in\u00a0\norigin and spoke a language related to Hebrew,\u00a0\u00a0 the Sumerian language was neither Semitic nor\u00a0\nIndo-European. In fact, it was related to no other\u00a0\u00a0 ancient language we know of. They are therefore\u00a0\nassumed to have been immigrants to the region,\u00a0\u00a0 and a number of places have been proposed as\u00a0\ntheir original homeland, including western Asia,\u00a0\u00a0 North Africa, and the Caucasus Mountains near\u00a0\nthe Black Sea. Instead of living as nomads with\u00a0\u00a0 flocks of animals, the Sumerians settled in\u00a0\nwalled towns surrounded by fields that were\u00a0\u00a0 owned by the local temple and rented to farmers,\u00a0\nwhere they had the ability to grow enough grain to\u00a0\u00a0 support populations in the tens of thousands, and\u00a0\nto survive bad harvests. But because Mesopotamia\u00a0\u00a0 did not have a lot of rainfall and relied on the\u00a0\nriver water that flooded the plain, the Sumerians\u00a0\u00a0 had to use a sophisticated system of irrigation\u00a0\nditches that brought water to entire communities,\u00a0\u00a0 which every citizen was obligated to help\u00a0\nmaintain. Modern scholars have connected this sort\u00a0\u00a0 of interdependency with the fact that Mesopotamian\u00a0\ncities tended to have authoritarian rulers who\u00a0\u00a0 enforced the cooperation needed to build and\u00a0\nrepair their agricultural infrastructure.\u00a0 Uruk, the largest of these cities with\u00a0\na peak population of around 40,000,\u00a0\u00a0 was initially founded around 4000 BCE and became\u00a0\na city a few centuries later. It was part of a\u00a0\u00a0 network of independent cities which for the next\u00a0\nthousand years were centered around large temples\u00a0\u00a0 and their rulers. These men, referred to as\u00a0\nensi, may have been both priests and kings.\u00a0\u00a0 Each Sumerian city had its own identifying symbol\u00a0\nwhich was carved on the seals used to mark tablets\u00a0\u00a0 or clay storage jars. Each also had a temple\u00a0\nthat was devoted to their patron god or goddess.\u00a0\u00a0 While Sumerian cities sometimes established\u00a0\ncolonies and trading posts in Upper Mesopotamia,\u00a0\u00a0 to the north in Asia Minor, and to the east in\u00a0\nIran, their way of life \u2013 settled agriculture,\u00a0\u00a0 urbanization, and a centralized government for\u00a0\neach city-state \u2013 seems to have spread to entirely\u00a0\u00a0 different cultures throughout the Near East.\nFor their livelihood, the Sumerians relied on\u00a0\u00a0 growing barley and dates, as well as raising\u00a0\nsheep and goats, and the temple\u2019s control over\u00a0\u00a0 important commodities like grain, oil, livestock,\u00a0\nand slaves, encouraged the development of written\u00a0\u00a0 inventory lists, which began as simple\u00a0\npictures of the commodities themselves,\u00a0\u00a0 and eventually developed into cuneiform script,\u00a0\nwhich we will discuss in a moment. From their\u00a0\u00a0 animals they spun wool, and from their grain\u00a0\nthey brewed beer, which was so fundamental to\u00a0\u00a0 their culture that the Epic of Gilgamesh says it\u00a0\nwas part of the process, along with lovemaking,\u00a0\u00a0 by which the temple prostitute Shamhat civilized\u00a0\nthe wild man Enkidu over the course of a week.\u00a0\u00a0 Sumer traded with Lebanon for wood, which\u00a0\nwas scarce in Mesopotamia, and it imported\u00a0\u00a0 obsidian from Asia Minor, as well as gold and\u00a0\nprecious stones from India and Afghanistan.\u00a0\u00a0 Examples of the Sumerian style of pottery\u00a0\nhave been found across Mesopotamia and Iran,\u00a0\u00a0 and there is evidence of a Sumerian influence on\u00a0\nthe Egyptian art of the time. It\u2019s also possible\u00a0\u00a0 that hieroglyphics were invented only after\u00a0\nthe Egyptians had seen Sumerian cuneiform.\u00a0 Starting around 2900 BCE, there were some\u00a0\nstructural changes among the cities of\u00a0\u00a0 Sumer. Power shifted, in at least some cities,\u00a0\nfrom priests to secular kings called lugals or\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cgreat men\u201d, who established family dynasties.\u00a0\nThe character of these rulers is disputed. Some\u00a0\u00a0 of them may have inspired the sort of despotic\u00a0\nand tyrannical behavior attributed to Gilgamesh,\u00a0\u00a0 the mythical king of Uruk, who according to\u00a0\nthe epic, forces the city\u2019s young people to\u00a0\u00a0 labor for him. At the same time, the lugals may\u00a0\nhave had councils with whom they would make their\u00a0\u00a0 decisions, and around this time the kings of\u00a0\nsome cities issued the first known law codes,\u00a0\u00a0 which were described as limiting the power of the\u00a0\nelite over the poor, the widows, and the orphans.\u00a0 The cities of this period, such as Ur, Kish, and\u00a0\nUruk, grew larger and absorbed the villages around\u00a0\u00a0 them. They built walls for the first time to\u00a0\ndefend themselves from each other and from\u00a0\u00a0 more distant states. The city of Kish fought a war\u00a0\nwith the Iranian region of Elam around 2700 BCE,\u00a0\u00a0 and a ruler of Lagash named Eannatum conquered\u00a0\nUruk and other Sumerian cities around 2500 BCE,\u00a0\u00a0 as well as nations beyond Mesopotamia itself;\u00a0\nbut his empire did not last beyond his death.\u00a0 This is also the period when cuneiform became\u00a0\na common method of recording information. The\u00a0\u00a0 name means \u201cwedge-shaped\u201d, due to the fact that\u00a0\nthis script used reeds cut at an angle to incise\u00a0\u00a0 characters made up of wedges into soft clay.\u00a0\nThe clay could then be smoothed over and reused,\u00a0\u00a0 or it could be baked for more permanent documents.\u00a0\nThough the earliest Mesopotamian texts were lists\u00a0\u00a0 of commodities that used pictures of the\u00a0\nobjects themselves rather than symbols,\u00a0\u00a0 the script eventually developed to the point that\u00a0\nit could record literature. Stories were written\u00a0\u00a0 about a mythological figure named Gilgamesh,\u00a0\nwhich inspired the well-known Epic of Gilgamesh,\u00a0\u00a0 written in Akkadian centuries later. The Epic\u00a0\ntells the story of the ancient king of Uruk,\u00a0\u00a0 who is so harsh a ruler that the gods send\u00a0\nthe wild man Enkidu against him. But the\u00a0\u00a0 two men become friends and have several\u00a0\nadventures together. When Enkidu dies,\u00a0\u00a0 Gilgamesh goes on a quest to find eternal\u00a0\nlife. Though he is unsuccessful, in the end\u00a0\u00a0 he realizes that his city, with its temple, its\u00a0\nwalls, and its gardens, is the monument to his\u00a0\u00a0 eternal greatness. In addition to poetry like the\u00a0\nEpic, from this time we also have religious hymns,\u00a0\u00a0 diplomatic letters, laws, and proclamations.\nAs the Sumerian culture of Lower Mesopotamia\u00a0\u00a0 became mixed with the Semitic culture of\u00a0\nthe Akkadians, who also lived in the area,\u00a0\u00a0 cuneiform was adapted to write their language as\u00a0\nwell, even though it was completely unrelated to\u00a0\u00a0 Sumerian. Many of our texts are lists of parallel\u00a0\nwords in the two languages, which were used as\u00a0\u00a0 dictionaries by scribes, who had to know both.\u00a0\nWriting cuneiform, like writing hieroglyphics,\u00a0\u00a0 was a difficult skill that only a few people\u00a0\nwould learn. Because it was based on syllables,\u00a0\u00a0 meaning fixed combinations of consonants and\u00a0\nvowels, rather than on individual letters\u00a0\u00a0 like we do now, there were many more characters to\u00a0\nmemorize than in a conventional alphabet. This was\u00a0\u00a0 done in schools called edubba, where scribes in\u00a0\ntraining would live while they were apprenticed,\u00a0\u00a0 and many of the tablets they wrote as practice\u00a0\nhave survived, because like other unimportant\u00a0\u00a0 texts, they were accidentally baked when the\u00a0\nbuildings they were stored in burned down.\u00a0 The sovereignty of the cities of Sumer was brought\u00a0\nto an end around 2200 BCE, by the rise of the\u00a0\u00a0 Semitic city of Akkad, which under the leadership\u00a0\nof its king Sargon the Great, established an\u00a0\u00a0 empire throughout Mesopotamia. This empire reached\u00a0\nwest to the Mediterranean, north to the Taurus\u00a0\u00a0 Mountains, and south to the Arabian Peninsula.\u00a0\nWhen a number of Sumerian cities rebelled against\u00a0\u00a0 Sargon\u2019s son and successor, Rimush, he destroyed\u00a0\nthem, and his grandson Naram-Sin expanded the\u00a0\u00a0 empire into Syria. But after about 200 years it\u00a0\nwas invaded and taken over by the people called\u00a0\u00a0 Gutians, who invaded from the Zagros mountains to\u00a0\nthe north. Around the same time, a Sumerian ruler\u00a0\u00a0 of Lagash named Gudea made his city a local power\u00a0\nthat developed trade relations throughout the\u00a0\u00a0 area. He also initiated a building program and\u00a0\nlegal reforms. He is often singled out for the\u00a0\u00a0 many stone statues that he had made of himself.\nAbout a hundred years later, in the late 2200s\u00a0\u00a0 BCE, a new Sumerian dynasty appeared in the\u00a0\ncity of Ur, which we refer to as the Third\u00a0\u00a0 Dynasty of Ur, where the term \u201cdynasty\u201d refers\u00a0\nto a succession of people from the same family,\u00a0\u00a0 in this case rulers. For another century, this\u00a0\ndynasty established an empire that extended to\u00a0\u00a0 Asia Minor and Iran, in which an ensi was\u00a0\nappointed to administer each province. This\u00a0\u00a0 empire was mainly the work of the dynasty\u2019s second\u00a0\nking, Shulgi, who may also have been responsible\u00a0\u00a0 for the earliest surviving code of law, although\u00a0\nthe prologue of this text attributes it to\u00a0\u00a0 Shulgi\u2019s father, Ur-Nammu. Like the later\u00a0\nCode of Hammurabi, it regulates property,\u00a0\u00a0 the personal status of free people and slaves,\u00a0\nmarriage, and crimes like murder and injury.\u00a0 This \u201cSumerian Renaissance\u201d came to an end when\u00a0\na group of nomadic Semites from the coasts of\u00a0\u00a0 Palestine and Syria, the Amorites, moved east\u00a0\nto Mesopotamia following a major drought that\u00a0\u00a0 hit the region around 2200 BCE. The Sumerians\u00a0\nnever regained their dominance over the area,\u00a0\u00a0 as the Amorites were displaced by the Babylonian\u00a0\nempire founded by Hammurabi around 1800 BCE,\u00a0\u00a0 and Sumerian stopped existing as a spoken\u00a0\nlanguage by around 2000 BCE. But because it\u00a0\u00a0 had been used to compose the important religious\u00a0\nand literary texts of the region, it continued\u00a0\u00a0 to be used for this purpose alongside Akkadian.\nIt is from around the time of the Amorite kings\u00a0\u00a0 that we find the texts of Sumerian king-lists,\u00a0\nwhich are one of our sources of information\u00a0\u00a0 for the rulers of the 3rd millennium BCE.\u00a0\nThese lists actually go back much farther,\u00a0\u00a0 but the first kings they mention are considered\u00a0\nmythical, because like the first human beings\u00a0\u00a0 described in Genesis, their lifespans are given\u00a0\nin the hundreds or even thousands of years,\u00a0\u00a0 and some of them are said to have ruled before\u00a0\na worldwide flood. Even the later rulers on the\u00a0\u00a0 lists are portrayed very anachronistically, in the\u00a0\nsense that these texts assume the following. One,\u00a0\u00a0 kingship was bestowed on one man by the gods.\u00a0\nTwo, it passed uninterrupted from one dynasty\u00a0\u00a0 to the next. And three, it moved over time from\u00a0\none city to another. This meant that even though\u00a0\u00a0 every city had kings, only one at a time was\u00a0\nking over all of Mesopotamia. But even though,\u00a0\u00a0 during the actual period in question, some\u00a0\ncities were in fact more powerful than others,\u00a0\u00a0 the idea of a single Sumerian king seems to be\u00a0\nan attempt to reconcile the actual independence\u00a0\u00a0 of the cities of Sumer with the situation\u00a0\nwhen the list was compiled, since by that\u00a0\u00a0 time there had been regimes like the Akkadian\u00a0\nempire that did control the entire region.\u00a0 The Sumerians disappeared entirely from\u00a0\nhistorical awareness until their material\u00a0\u00a0 remains were discovered by archeologists in\u00a0\nthe 19th century, and their written records\u00a0\u00a0 were deciphered. But their neighbors,\u00a0\nthe Semitic Babylonians and Assyrians,\u00a0\u00a0 were already familiar to modern scholars of the\u00a0\nBible as well as classical historians. Their\u00a0\u00a0 beginnings were murky, but let\u2019s move forward\u00a0\nand see what we can turn up about them next. "
