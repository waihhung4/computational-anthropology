"(soft music) - [Narrator] The story of writing, astronomy, and law. The story of civilization\nitself begins in one place. Not Egypt, not Greece, not Rome. But Mesopotamia. Mesopotamia is an\nexceedingly fertile plain situated between the Tigris\nand the Euphrates Rivers. For five millennia,\nthe small strip of land situated in what is today\nIraq, Kuwait and Syria fostered innovations that\nwould change the world forever. Inhabited for nearly 12,000 years, Mesopotamia's stable climate, rich soil and steady supply of\nfresh water made it ideal for agriculture to develop and thrive. About 6,000 years ago,\nseemingly overnight, some of these agricultural\nsettlements blossomed into some of the world's first cities. In the period between 4,000 and 3,100 BC, Mesopotamia was dotted\nwith a constellation of competing city states. At one point, they were unified under the Akkadian Empire and then broke apart forming the empires of\nAssyria and Babylon. Despite near constant warfare, innovation and development\nthrived in ancient Mesopotamia. They built on a monumental scale from palaces to ziggurats, mammoth temples served as ritual locations to commune with the gods. They also developed advanced mathematics, including a base 60 system that created a 60-second minute, a 60-minute hour and a 360-degree circular angle. The Babylonians used\ntheir sophisticated system of mathematics to map and study the sky. They divided one earth\nyear into 12 periods. Each was named after the\nmost prominent constellations in the heavens, a tradition\nlater adopted by the Greeks to create the zodiac. They also divided the\nweek into seven days, naming each after their seven gods embodied by the seven\nobservable planets in the sky. But perhaps the most impactful\ninnovation to come out of Mesopotamia is literacy. What began as simple pictures\nscrawled onto wet clay to keep track of goods and wealth developed into a\nsophisticated writing system by the year 3,200 BC. This writing system would\ncome to be called cuneiform in modern times and\nproved so flexible that over the span of 3,000\nyears, it would be adapted for over a dozen different major languages and countless uses including recording the law of the\nBabylonian king Hammurabi, which formed the basis of a\nstandardized justice system. But Mesopotamia's success\nbecame its undoing. Babylon in particular\nproved too rich a state to resist outside envy. In 539 BC, the Persian king\nCyrus conquered Babylon and sealed his control over\nthe entirety of Mesopotamia. For centuries, this\narea became a territory of foreign empires. Eventually, Mesopotamia\nwould fade like its kings into the mists of history. And its cities would sink\nbeneath the sands of Iraq. But its ideas would\nprevail in literacy, law, math, astronomy and the\ngift of civilization itself. "
