"in 1997 archaeologists working out in the Arid te Tech mountains some 60 kilm to the east of sanley era Came Upon something they hadn't [Music] expected out there in the harsh open Hills of turkey's Southeastern provinces where the height of Summer seems like a scorched alien world innumerable incredible archaeological sites had already been added to an everwing list since Diggs began in the 1960s and yet more would follow for even in those dry arid Hills there is life [Music] by the late Autumn as the harsh Summer Sun releases its grip on the land and winter grasses Sprout animals begin moving in on mass nomadic Clans heading down from the slopes of mount caradog to the north to graze their herds on the pastures of the te Tech hillsides dwarfed by that true Mountain to the north the techs are Hills in reality formed by erosion during relatively recent interglacial and post glacial periods of the last ice age when this was a humid abundant land populated by colossal herds of wildlife a not too distant time of 10,000 and more years ago still visible on the landscape in Long dried up riverbeds and abundant fossil remains though little remains now from that post glacial Epoch of plenty the teexs remain a popular place for hunting though much of the game is now officially protected as endangered species by the Turkish [Music] government today the majority of people make their living not from Wild food but the descendants of the hunted and the gathered harnessed and selectively bred many thousands of years ago through the Arts of animal husbandry and agriculture just how long those nomadic Travelers have made that Journey Down to the te Tech Hills for the winter is difficult to say nor just how often goats and sheep have grazed the slopes of one Hill in particular but this is where Turkish archaeologist bahattin chelik and his colleagues made their astounding realizations in 1997 in those days it had no name but today it's famous named for a nearby Hill known worldwide as carahan teepe by that time the discovery of gockley tape just a few years earlier on a relatively nearby Hilltop had already completely altered our understanding of that distant Epoch after the end of the last ice age and now one by one similar sign were being located but of all those SES it was carahan teepe that made the biggest Mark of all here sprawling over that sunbaked Hilltop even prior to digging celik and his team counted hundreds of t-shaped megalithic obelisks like those found at gcle [Music] Pepe bizarre monoliths jutting out of the ground near everywhere they looked after preliminary digs well over 250 would be located in all oozing for some 33 hectares across the entirety of the hilltop and adjacent slopes [Music] besides the Steep Rocky edges on the southern and western sides every part of the hill was coated with the edifices of humanity and when full scale digs began the totem pole like carvings of hybrid monsters animals and people only added to the Enigma of the site it didn't take long for karahan teepe to be dated to the same age as gockley tape and the earlier stages of the pre potery neic settlement of navali chori which would ultimately become a farming [Music] Community but there were differences Too Faced with nightmarish depictions of Mythic hybrid forms and unfathomably complex iconography and art of a completely different nature to any other site yet found in the region chelich and his team te knew it would take decades to get close to even a small picture of just what had happened there all those Millennia [Music] ago only then in the 1990s having the knowledge to realize what those jutting pillars were how many countless other Travelers had come to the place over the long Millennia not realizing its man-made nature we can only Ponder today going on 30 years has passed since the initial discovery of carahan Tepe a good deal of the site has been dug revealing an incredibly complex series of megalithic enclosures and yet still only around 5% of the overall site has been exposed very little research [Music] published astonishingly of the more than 40 similar sites from that same age often referred to now as the Tash tppa or Stone Hills culture though gockley tee was discovered earlier carahan teepe could be even bigger and of a greater age if you haven't seen it already here is my film on gockley teepe it's nearly 3 hours long and it took me years to research soon we'll embark on our journey to decipher some of the secrets of carahan teepe potentially coming to some conclusions about this incredible and mysterious site but first a quick word from our sponsor my name is Pete Kelly I'm a writer from the UK and the guy behind this channel as a historian I'm fascinated by family history [Music] I think remembering those who came before isn't just important but fundamental to understanding who we are today my Heritage the sponsor of today's video is a great way to get to grips with who your ancestors were and where you came from to get started all I had to do was input the names of my parents and the automated tools within my Heritage allowed me to build my own family tree using the instant discoveries feature I've been able to create a detailed network of my family going back nearly 200 years by connecting to other family trees from existing users of my Heritage I was even able to find my great great grandfather William Duffy who was born all the way back in 1840 in Omar where I still have family today on the other side of the family this newspaper article I found using record match shed light on my great-grandfather peor Bavon who was born in Melbourne Australia and was quite the amateur athlete described as having the family faculty for hurling maybe I'll have to give it a go another feature on my Heritage is the photo editing tool this is an old picture from a hundred years ago of my great-grandfather D Duffy not only could I restore the image but colorize it and animate it too really making him come alive if you're a fan of History like me I just know you'll love these features my Heritage has to offer sign up now using the link in the description to find out the Amazing Stories your ancestors have to tell now back to the ancient world approaching carahan teepe today dust clouds swirling over the empty Mountain Road it's not difficult to see why it took so long to be rediscovered by the modern world though every Hilltop threatens now to reveal remains from the prehistoric past until comparatively recently the sheer isolation and size of the place kept its Secrets hidden even When approaching the site itself on foot there isn't much to see from Below [Music] not just no temples but no great roofed structure to protect the site or permanent Visitor Center like at gockley tape systematic digs only having begun in [Music] 2019 just a few minutes later though when ascend in the low slope of the hillside all of a sudden amazing things to be [Music] seen the relatively small number of trenches that have been dug so far being more than enough to showcase the sheer scale and complexity of the overall site thought to sprawl far and wide across the entire Hilltop a place of innumerable Mysteries even now after close to 30 years of Investigation a great deal of systematic planning and surface surveys having been carried out before the fullscale digs began still not one Shard of pottery has ever been found nor any evidence of domesticated plants or animals like go Beckley tee and countless other sites across the region the evidence overwhelmingly suggesting people here to have lived a complex hunter gatherer lifestyle [Music] on the road to Agriculture and animal husbandry for sure but not there yet a lifestyle reflected in the symbolism seen all over in animal sculptures t-shaped pillars obelisks and enclosures [Music] this was not the farming world of the so-called mother goddess seen in art by the time of the Neolithic but seemingly a male dominated one phallic totems very often being depicted both on animals and people for example just in 2023 a masculine statue was discovered of a man with ribs showing and prominent penis on display his somewhat emaciated features looking the exact opposite of the mother goddess of chatal hoyuk found in later farming [Music] societies this particular tendency to prominently depict fallaces is perhaps most obviously seen in one of the enclosures that catches attention on the approach up the hill one of the most unusual at any of the Tash tppa sites enclosure AB is a relatively small chamber dug out of the hillside with what look like pillars filling the space an ominous head overlooking it all though official Publications are few and far between archaeologists have thus far speculated on the pillars representing penises the place overall seeming to have something thing to do with [Music] fertility there are many interl enclosures at kahane made with many different construction methods some carved directly into the Bedrock others combined with external masonry some of the most extensively excavated thus far those linked to enclosure AB the so-called penis room are just as interesting enclosure AA on one side having a deep pit within with benches arrayed around the perimeter seemingly to allow Spectators to watch whatever took place here all those Millennia [Music] ago on the other side enclosure a d is one of the largest somewhat resembling the major structures at gockley tee though entirely unique nonetheless surrounded by large pillars this seems to have been the main chamber attached to two smaller rooms just maybe public and private [Music] spaces one t-shaped pillar in particular in enclosure ad has received a lot of discussion having the same anthropomorphic depiction of human arms on either side as at gocke the hands also having four fingers [Music] each a kind of rock cut Channel running between all three enclosures completes the picture perhaps used for the moving of sacred or ceremonial water between the chambers for some unknown purpose or [Music] ritual in truth even to call the collections of megaliths at kahane enclosures or Chambers is to unwittingly do them a disservice though few other options exist in our much reduced frame of reference named alphabetically today as archaeological convention dictates their original titles names meanings are lost [Music] it may even be that rather than temples under the star studded sky at least some of the structures here held roofs a suggestion that had been made for gockley tape to remaining largely hypothetical until the discovery of a scattering of large Stones all over the base of enclosure AC perhaps the remains of a [Music] roof some of the large pillars also seeming to hold grooves where other Stones could have been slotted in on [Music] top it might be then that some enclosures were r proofed others perhaps much larger ones were not after all given the wild variations of artistic depictions found at the site there's no reason to assume any kind of standardization in construction methods if some of the structures were roved however as well as the significant amounts of so-called domestic evidence on on the site such as Stone cooking wear it may be that at least some individuals lived here permanently all year round even if a larger majority only visited seasonally dating to some 12,000 years ago with some experts suggesting an even older date car arane might nevertheless be considered one of the oldest permanent human settlements yet found on the planet construction at kahane didn't happen all at once but gradually over the course of many generations though over time nearly the entire Hilltop would be coated in enclosures and [Music] structures many not constructed externally like at gockley tee but cut deep into the Rock itself when viewing the entire mound from the air the digs undertaken so far cover just a tiny fraction some 5% with the eroded tops of t-shaped pillars jutting out everywhere [Music] else more and more Monumental buildings are being uncovered all the time always holding the potential to throw out everything we think we know thus far one particularly interesting development is that people may have been buried at kahane human remains always being something that was exceptionally rare at gockley tape though lead archaeologist there CLA Schmidt nonetheless always thought burials would be discovered one day in his view these sites at least in part being monuments to the ancestors unfortunately because of the early stage in investigations as well as the difficulties that came with the global pandemic in 2020 little research has officially been published it could still be years before any any definitive conclusions are made by the on-site archaeologists but this doesn't stop the rest of the archaeological Community to delve into what is currently [Music] known one of the best ways to do this is through the abundant material evidence much of which is showcased now in the sanley Eartha Museum [Music] besides the stone bowls and instruments scattered around the site are intricately carved Idols found in dizzying amounts huge ominous heads totem pole like pillars and depictions of animals often of a fearsome aspect [Music] BS crocodiles wolves and bears being favored another incredible realization in the last few years is that at least some of the idols seem to have been [Music] painted unlike other totemic monuments throughout history like at chven in the Peruvian Andes a similarly important foundational site the totem Poes at kahane don't seem to reflect mythological creatures for the most part but realworld animals abundant in this region until relatively recently and people entwined [Music] one particularly striking figure that shows up several times is of a half man half beast hybrid though erosion over the 11,000 years or so since it was first carved has somewhat reduced the definition of its form an argument can be made for this particular statue to partially represent the apex predator which once flourished in this region until going extinct in the 20th century the leopard just like apex predators from all over the world like ly revered as a powerful rival to humanity with a similar so-called Cult of the leopard being carried on to chatal hyok in later Millennia but why would a leopard be depicted bursting out from a human form or vice versa man and animal entwined at the beginning of all things [Music] [Music] 15,000 years ago an extraordinary culture was flourishing across much of Eurasia a great burst of creativity that can still be seen in the spectacular Engravings and paintings that Adorn Rock surfaces from the French perigord to the Russian [Music] plain first revealed to the modern world in the late 1800s at world famous sites like Altamira and [Music] Lasco those magnificent pieces of Art would completely change perceptions of what had been possible in the prehistoric world then just over 100 years ago after an interval of so many Untold Millennia another of the masterpieces of that world came once again into the orbit of humanity the year was 1912 when three teenagers in the far south of France unknowingly teetering on the brink of the greatest single incident of suffering it had ever yet seen stumbled upon an intricate prehistoric cave system known as lroy [Music] fra within that cavernous network of winding paths and Open Spaces apparently hidden for thousands upon thousands of years a vast chamber stretched broken up by stalactites and curving walls and on those walls just like at the previously discovered sites like Lasco and timera a variety of an animal depictions could be seen bison deer owls and [Music] lions just like at the tasa in Southeastern turkey flourishing at the same time to the south and east representations of animals seen in the landscape around very much within the same art tradition that existed in the upper Paleolithic from as early as 40,000 years ago all the way to the dawn of [Music] Agriculture but there is something else too that bears a similarity to those sites of the Tash tppa because alongside hunting scenes just like at carahan Tepe there are fallaces too given pride of place and prominence but at L try fra a particularly unique and then unprecedented painting was to be found around 14,000 years ago deep in those subterranean in passages by the flicker of torch light a half man half animal figure was painted just before work at the cave stopped until after the war due to the German invasion this drawing was made and the figure named the Sorcerer of LaTroy fra painted all black for some the sorcerer has a bison head and human legs others describe it as a devil goat man though unique in paint the sorcerer is far from a solitary find similar so-called little Devils of the Paleolithic magdalenian culture being seen at llara in aorus and ab mess in the dooin when considered alongside the antler bone headdresses similarly being found at Star Car in Yorkshire from a more or less similar time period further adding to the pool of evidence the implications are staggering [Music] seeming to suggest lional places in cave systems or bodies of water where hybrid Ice Age beings were acted out or depicted perhaps in a mimetic state of synthesis where the person remained but became the animal too where eer and Eaton are one the human and the natural world come together at the dawn of [Music] everything and there is much more evidence too by the time of the next war in 1939 another incredible find was made truly demonstrating the Deep Antiquity of the human animal hybrid tradition today The Lion Man of holenstein stad remains one of the earliest and most remarkable of all displays of the creative spark ever seen in humanity with a likely Agee of at least 30,000 years old other estimates bringing it significantly older to near [Music] 40,000 made of mammoth tusk the most readily available material for those ancient Ice Age Hunters though heavily eroded now the piece has been suggested to depict a dancing figure a bear or a lion but with humanlike features perhaps engaged in some distant ritual for archaeologist Steven mien having began its transition many thousands of years before The Lion Man represents the point where the cognitive ability of humanity had definitively changed culminating now in Wild expressions of creativity that defy nature to survive across eons for the first time ever in the entire universe as far as we know culture intellect spilling forth from biology [Music] heading southwards across the sea and further forwards in time to the Lush grasslands that once coated the Sahara Desert similarly fascinating carvings are to be seen at the sights of latmos and jba parched Rocky outcrops in the midst of Mighty sand Junes and Dead Rivers still stand the so-called dog heads of fizan though difficult to date they are thought to have been created at roughly a similar time to the sprawling Neolithic town at chatal hyok in Anatolia in around 7 or 8,000 BC where humans had began intensively harnessing agriculture though still engaged in hunting activities for much of their [Music] sustenance there where art and hunting scenes are seen on the walls of labyrinth in chambered homes depictions of crane Wings being worn by human actors can also be seen [Music] and just like The Lion Man one has been identified as a human bare hybrid the images perhaps depicting costumes worn by individuals engaged in ritual performances but what does it all mean [Music] as is often the case given the tiny fragments of evidence that survive archaeologists are torn on the matter but some like South African David Lewis Williams choose to see the Myriad depictions of human animal hybrids as having their roots in shamanistic ceremonies not too dissimilar to those still taking place all over the world today involving Altered States Of Consciousness Perhaps it is no surprise that all of these depictions of hybrid animals including those at kahane can be said to look psychedelic [Music] at another ancient site shanidar 4 in what is now Kurdistan an individual was found with substances buried alongside him that were found to be psychotropic leading researchers to regard him as a shaman with the most ancient of heritages stemming from our deep hunter gatherer past at the beginning of all things Shamanism is a concept seen all over the world in all different cultures at all different times from the Siberian Hermits who gave the term its modern name to the natives of the deep Brazilian rainforests and aboriginals of Australia there seems to be something in the concept that is exceptionally difficult to separate from Humanity surviving in complex farming societies as well as in ancient tribes MCH wear Jaguars of ancient mesoamerica are a good example thought to have shape-shifted into different forms to travel to the other world on behalf of those gathered around bystanders perhaps joining in with the trance to Aid the shaman in contacting ancestral [Music] Spirits at carahan teepe the suggestion has been made that the Monstrous hybrid figures could be half man half leopard powerful Hunters still found in the region until very recently the enclosures perhaps acting like the cave in Paleolithic Europe or the Temple of ancient Mexico mountaintops have often been seen as entrance ways to the other world up in the clouds where the veil Between Worlds is thinner than at ground level strange cutouts in the Rock at both gockley and carahan teepe that could be construed as offering cups are found as well as shreds of evidence for musical instruments and yet more that could remain unrecognized within the growing Museum collections of Anatolia bull roarers rattles scrapers clappers and skin drums being among the most ancient of instruments to have survived sounds that evoke Distant Memories of ancestral dancing around the t-shaped [Music] pillars just maybe in support of a shamanic Journey at all the sights of the Tash tppa abundant displays of Art and symbolism are to be seen displays that are impossible to explain without recognizing the clearly Advanced social organization and Rich culture required to create them symbolism that famously LED gcle Tee's first excavator CLA Schmidt to suggest his sight to be one of the first temples on Earth and yet today given the evidence from all over the Paleolithic World karahan Tepe does not seem a place of Firsts but a continuation and development of existing hunter gatherer lifeways a great flourishing of societal complexity for sure but set within the remit of wider Humanity [Music] and amazingly given our knowledge of The Wider human story it may be possible to interpret some of those Tales written in the Rocks so long ago at gockley tape in particular one t-shaped pillar holds a unique scene that anthropologists have poured over for decades in attempts to reconstruct early hollene belief systems the story it tells could well have happened at carahan teepe 2 relating directly to the half human hybrids so ornately carved there into the [Music] stone for over 100 years now largely using the still surviving shamanic traditions of hunter gatherer groups On The Fringe of the urban globalized World anthropologists have sought to recreate the ideas of the very earliest era of humanity in recent decades it is to pillar 43 in enclosure D at gockley tee that many have turned amazingly its carvings potentially telling a similar story to the groups that still exist today the tale of the shamanic Journey if this reading of the evidence is even partly correct for a shaman or religious Elder at karahan teepe all those Millennia ago just the same as a Siberian today the situation would have likely been similar a particularly prominent and confident individual it was the Shaman's job to act as a bridge for the community across the fluid Borderlands to the world of the Divine places considered particularly useful for this traditionally being regarded as rivers and the Summits of mountain peaks in times of trouble necessity or Strife the shaman would physically embark on a journey to the other side with the aim of contacting the ancestral spirits to ask for their influence in the land of the living in order to embark on his quest on the behalf of his community Not only would the shaman likely assume a costume but often imitate a particular animal too shamanic alter egos worldwide ranging from owls deer cranes to Jaguars tigers and leopards another tool in the Shaman's kit often being psychoactive drugs death is often imitated a symbolic end and sometimes regeneration is the animal perhaps to not only get him or herself ready but as a group activity for all to join in with the Trans usually supported by music incense and chanting crucially the shaman would not be alone on his voyage in addition to the community members supporting him from Earth friendly Spirits like lizards spiders scorpions foxes frogs and hairs can lend a hand too in many societies the more of these they are known to be able to cooperate with the more powerful they are assumed to be many of these supporting animals are seen at the Tash sites with birds and snakes being particularly prominent as well as scorpions perhaps being a local variant of the worldwide phenomenon the carvings in particular the one scene on pillar 43 perhaps being further aids to help with the theater of events at gockley teepe one particular Shaman or shamanic tradition may have utilized the Fox as their Spirit vessel at carahan pay it may have been the leopard that was favored one of the stranger elements of the Tash tppa sites like karahan Tepe has been a complete failure to integrate them into existing models of the origins of stratified States previously assumed to have originated with agriculture [Music] the seemingly institutionalized religious authorities dogmas even seen at the likes of karahan Tepe in the form of monumental building projects and activities long before the adoption of farming being such a paradigm shifter that in the late 1990s it led French archaeologist Jac kovon to argue religion to be in fact the mover to Urban Society while CLA Schmidt accepted the idea of shamanic rituals at the Tash tppa sites British archaeologist Ian Hodder took it even further by arguing for specific individual Elders or trickster figures specializing in ritual knowledge and presiding over construction efforts [Music] it was at H's site of chatal hoyuk in central Anatolia that some of the supposed earliest evidence of temples or shrines were uncovered in the 1960s by James melard following in the footsteps of Kathleen Kenyan at Jericho in classifying several structures as non-domestic ritual buildings very much in turn followed following the post Enlightenment assumption first proposed by Emil durkheim of a dichotomy between the sacred and the profane or religious and everyday being at the center of all religious [Music] beliefs when hoder reinvestigated chatal hoyuk in the90s and 2000s it was largely his job to quash the eurocentric ideas he found no distinction at all between the everyday and the spiritual religion being suffused into everything at the sight the whole world given spiritual meaning at chatal hoyuk in their own way every house was sacred perhaps the same went for carahan Tepe 2o where it would be outdated today to say the megaliths formed temples or shrines alone the terms seeming somewhat redundant given the sheer amount of activities likely carried out there just maybe above all the theatrical displays of shamanic elders willing Builders of the enclosures around them dancing at the dawn the more we learn about karahan tee the more amazing it becomes complex hunter gatherers still closely tied to their traditions of old but adhering to new ways now too coming together to create something incredible transcending them all but what of those individuals who planned and orchestrated the construction [Music] efforts for those many archaeologists have argued for the birth of a priesthood of sorts here loyalty could surely not be guaranteed to any single individual the first verifiably hereditary priesthoods only arriving thousands of years later after all each enclosure May well have been buried after its immediate use perhaps suggesting rival traditions and there are other hints at the Tash tppa sites that Unity may not have been the only way of life at chanu another of the Tash tppa sites the remains of over 450 people including headless torsos have been found in a room christened the house of skulls vertebrae attached to some of the skulls suggested they were axed while flesh still remained on the body when beheaded most seemed to be in the prime of life though not necessarily killed by the beheadings archaeologist Robert Braidwood did not shy away from the possibility traces of blood still staining the stone structure adjacent to a public Plaza that looks suspiciously like a sacrificial [Music] altar another facet of human society seen in cultures all over the world is that when populations increase above around 100 or 150 individuals so too do mistrusts and [Music] anxieties a niggling worry of some unseen future or a so-called other such esoteric anxieties as these are hard for even an all- knowing Shaman to deal with let alone people today leading to fights skirmishes and fullscale War one way of attempting to deal with these pressures of living as a large group is also seen all over the world at the beginnings of almost every society on Earth the very real possibility exists that human sacrifice was practiced at the so-called House of the skulls at chanu we don't know for sure but scraps of skulls found at gockley teepe too may represent some kind kind of a similar situation and perhaps at kahane too it has been argued that as soon as human society becomes stratified and complex Human Sacrifice appears here we have another interpretation of the Goatman the scapegoat or sacrificial lamb of later generations and our world today just possibly having its roots here ancient sacrifices orchestrated by shadowy cabals of cunning Proto priests [Music] before the discovery of karahan tee its sister site gockley tape was seen by many as something of an enigma an [Music] anomaly but in reality though astonishing in its complexity this was far from the case for those well-versed in the pre potery Neolithic World archaeologists already having worked in the region for three decades by that point uncovering sites of a similar age and culture at the likes of navali [Music] chori notably where t-shape pillars also once stood and chanu where American Robert Braidwood tirelessly dedicated his career today out on the so-called hilly flanks between the Zagros and the Taurus Mountains named as such by Braidwood in relation to their supposed peripheral location to the more popularly known f cresant more than 40 contemporary sites with t-shaped pillars or similar figurative decorations have been located far from anomalies the fabulously complex architecture at gockley teepe and carahan teepe fitting in easily with the everchanging archaeological consensus [Music] sea shells found at carahan teepe from the far off Mediterranean and Red Seas along with obsidian shards from Central Anatolia hint at the long-distance transportation of goods and [Music] people many archaeologists seeing widespread population movements as common in prehistory with others even arguing for Proto trade networks having developed by this time given the sheer scale of their construction and their possible seasonal nature the possibility exists then that the megalithic monuments of the tacha were not merely local inv Investments but Regional affairs with some individuals traveling considerable distances to take [Music] part clearly these were time and labor intensive events construction efforts that could only have been undertaken by a cohesive cooperative and well-resourced population many archaeologists have argued that the ritual Investments at karahan teepe could have been either knowingly or unknowingly undertaken by individuals as a sign of commitment to their [Music] Community allowing reputations to be built and maintained and even Outsiders to the initial Community to be impressed though there is currently no evidence of warfare amongst the Tash communities as the conventional wisdom would hold this to have left some discernible trace on the landscape we can ask the question of whether the individual centers could have been competing nonetheless in a sort of prehistoric arms race perhaps the most impressive sites gaining preferential access to the Trade Network or passing pilgrims and travelers if not built to intimidate powerful enemies then to signal at other centers and impress potential recruits or [Music] Allies but would the community who built karahan Tepe have even seen themselves as separate to those at gockley tee and the other Tash tea sites should we be thinking of them as separate entities and what is a state [Music] anyway archeologists have been attempting to answer such questions for as long as the discipline has existed but like all Sciences the situation becomes more complicated and difficult to pin down into a cohesive model with each passing [Music] decade back in the 1930s close to 100 years ago now groundbreaking prehistorian V Gordon child first coined the term Neolithic Revolution to describe Humanity's transition from ing to farming as our primary form of [Music] sustenance believing the prime Catalyst to have been [Music] geography since the discovery of karahan Tepe in the 1990s this idea has been challenged time and time [Music] again as have pretty much all of the other major theories on the development of agricultural Societies in particular a good deal of disagreement remains on the precise relationship in hunter gatherer societies between humanity and the natural [Music] world which are often by no means as clearcut as they were once thought to be though generally egalitarianism is thought to have been the [Music] norm in farming societies on the other hand a world based on segmentation and separation is usually seen such changes in the perception of and potential to appropriate the environment did not not happen all at once but over the span of many generations over thousands of years of stopping and starting but at the sights of the Tash tppa where many hunter gatherer communities ultimately transitioned into farming ones there is a good argument that people made this transition for the first time time from a mindset typically associated with hunting to one associated with agriculture taking on the agricultural mindset without having yet become [Music] Farmers though much Still Remains shrouded in mystery today the existence of hunter gatherer sites like karahan teepe has definitively put to bed both the idea of prehistoric humans being simple and that the transition to farming was anything like simple and quick Revolution as child had once argued but with the wild ancestors of both domestic plants and animals being found at karahan teepe and the Tash T sites with others like chianu and navali chori ultimately becoming farming settlements how did this transition [Music] happen one Theory put forward by Anthropologist Brian Hayden concerns the establishment of a hierarchical system through the power of ideology spread primarily through communal events such as [Music] feasts with certain individuals and groups over time gaining surpluses of food which they could then leverage to gain yet more power eventually turning it into a hereditary system with the inhabitants of karahan Tepe still practicing hunter gatherer Lifestyles any such Surplus was in the future but a similar concept may have been in play of people coming together to celebrate and Forge ties to tell stories dance communally and bond with their extended familial Networks French Anthropologist alarm testart argues that it is this becoming dependent on the storage of food that leads Hunter forager societies to become ready or pre-adapt for the transition to farming a great number of wild grains have been found in the Tash sites as well as evidence of people working for an overarching goal the situation becomes even more fascinating when we consider that every enclosure at gockley tee and seemingly many at carahan teepe seem to have been buried and covered up after a relatively short lifespan suggesting that the carvings and enclosures themselves were not necessarily the most important thing but the Act of Creation [Music] itself the bonds forged and perhaps authority adhered to through the making of the enclosures ultimately representing the same spark that made the temples of Mesopotamia the pyramids and the gothic churches of medieval y Europe but of course to build such a monument would require a good deal of planning and surely this leadership had some bearing on the ensuing development of society an initial spark of inspiration leading to an authority being in charge even for a short while with these sights in mind all thought to have been made voluntarily a question of Steven mien can be considered of why people would labor in the hot sun when they didn't have to particularly in a pre monetary system they did it for for a higher purpose given the purported emphasis on spirituality at places like kahane perhaps it was the spiritual leaders the shamans who led the group reinforcing burgeoning psychological commitments social identities and cultural memory through the medium of performance storytelling and ritual even today the power of a ritual display should not be underestimated often still including ephemeral intangible costumes masks dancing and even incantations [Music] relatively rare events in the year they can be of such a spectacular nature that they leave lasting imprints on the memories of those who take part dissolving the ego even and inspiring a belief in something more than oneself particularly if never having witnessed one before or only once or twice given the relatively short lifespans of the Tash tppa enclosures as well as a 100 Years of archaeological information from elsewhere a number of experts have suggested the cave art and even murals of Stone Age houses like a chatal hoyuk to have been largely ephemeral undertakings not necessarily ever meant to be marveled at or enjoyed as we do with art today plastered over and begun a new at the next point of social transition in a new ritual and for the cave painters never visited again the Act of Creation itself being of the utmost [Music] importance at the so-called Mega sites of Europe's catini trilia culture of the fourth millennium BC entire houses would regularly be ritually burned down and begun a new a concept that seems to have remained in place for the IW people of Northern Japan until well into the 19th century there is a lot of speculation here but unfortunately given the sheer age of these sites and the sparcity of evidence speculation is often all we have [Music] most recently anthropologists have mused on the effects such so-called hunting scenes at chatal hoyuk and the decorated stonework at sites like carar anepe could have had on ritual performances and even their commemoration afterwards the carvings at kahane in particular of a ferocious aspect largely of natural species that can still be seen in the world today as well as human depictions and hybrid animals remain powerful today let alone when they were first created could it be that the very exceptional nature of these images may have contributed to the production of ritual systems designed to access the invisible world of spirits and the ancestors only reachable through dramatic physical Transformations with future generations of shamans being inspired to manifest the nonhuman through their own performances a circular system of religious ideas with the ideas themselves coming first of course but once they were recorded in stone there being little way of stopping them particularly with ambitious new generations ever seeking meaning and a place in the world for like all the immensely intelligent animals of our species with the greatest imaginations we know of in the universe we are prone to [Music] politicization particularly when faced with individuals who have the power to bring the vital forces of the world into being through ritual alone to bless and Empower their followers to curse their [Music] enemies the possibility remains that the enclosures at karahan Tepe could have been attempts by shamanic individuals or groups to display in the community and gain or regain the the trust of their tribe ultimately to mediate with the Divine in such a way particularly during a crisis is to constantly have to prove oneself the power of the shaman could always be taken away again and replaced by a rival if they were not seen to be effective anymore the enclosures could have provided an esoteric Place only usable by them or their disciples thus cementing their usefulness to the group as The Architects of [Music] memory but perhaps only for a single lifetime or those of their immediate disciples before another Shaman took over and made his own theater of memory perhaps tearing down the old one or covering it [Music] up today large scale or even small events undertaken by religious groups can take months of careful preparation and training as well as large scale monetary and resource Investments it seems that something similar May well have happened at carahan teepe requiring a good deal more resources than usual in an egalitarian society with some kind of Shaman or leader seeming to be in charge maybe there were many shamans competing simultaneously in a sort of arms race for [Music] Authority while this in itself does not necessarily imply a state level of organization or organized priesthood it does seem to have been one rung on on the way there after all communal TRS Spirit Journeys and Altered States Of Consciousness are not exclusive to hunter gatherer societies at all but have long made up integral parts of complex liturgical religions either happening in the open or behind closed doors as so esoteric knowledge no longer available for everyone to watch unfold as they did within the circles of old for the Maya of meso America who still practice the religion of their ancestors today the shaman is still a powerful member of the [Music] Community just as they had been it seems during the days of the classic era greatness in the first Millennium ad then elevated to the heedy heights of an organized priesthood though arguably practicing largely the same religion as before their people began living in cities in the first place toward the end of the second millennium BC and after the collapse of the classic Maya Urban centers in the 9th century ad they went back to living in the forests once more in much smaller groups taking their shamanic ways with them the concept it seems like at karahan Tepe May well be entirely scalable though almost all of the evidence is missing theorists continue to contemplate just what was going on at that fascinating sight in the te Tech mountains some 12 or 13,000 years ago as we have already seen in 2001 one archaeologist Jack kovon incorporating anthropology archaeology as well as cognitive psychology released the groundbreaking book the birth of the Gods and the origins of agriculture containing the Revolutionary idea that it may have been really the human mind not any geographical conditions feasting or material concerns that primarily allowed people to come together to build the foundations necessary to engage in the often unpleasant activity of farming a difficult choice that took a long time to master a cognitive leap which is difficult to explain in terms of individual benefit usually leading to a more labor intensive life heavy investment in seemingly wasteful activities and the Toleration of [Music] inequality though not referred to direct directly in the book kon's argument can be extended to karahan teepe with increased investment in ideological infrastructure as well as the demographic stresses of larger groups coming together people could have become more interested in devoting time to more labor intensive activities if it meant benefiting the group in this Model A revolution in the mind came first creating strong stories at the foundation of society which could then lead to the heavy investment of resources necessary for investment in farming a cognitive turn utilizing elaborate rituals and composite images of animals and humans the heavy investment of resources in neolithic Societies in the Apparently non-utilitarian seeming to continue from the Tash tea all the way to today even though its way of life and perhaps its people too ultimately died out astonishingly karahan teepe may have been one of the first times that this coming together of society happened on a large scale one experiment on the road to the conceptual as well as economic way of being of later Bronze Age societies so many thousands of years later [Music] but could the basic idea at the heart of it all have survived all through history even to today [Music] [Laughter] Stonehenge it's perhaps the most iconic stone circle found anywhere in the [Music] world for many it's the exact image recalled when considering such a term [Music] those Mighty hee rocks on the soulsbury plane erected for who knows what [Music] purpose though speculated on for as long as people have done such [Music] thing for the late archaeologist Aubrey Burl the world's leading Authority on British stone circles though separated by more than 6,000 years both Stonehenge and the megaliths of karahan teepe should be considered in the same category of megalithic architecture and yet amazingly having been buried in the ground for more than 10 Millennia rather than exposed to the elements The Monuments at kahane survive to a much better condition than those at Stonehenge and the other megalithic sites of Britain well in truth it is a miracle that any survived given the efforts invested by those seeking to erase or irrevocably alter them over the [Music] centuries not much evidence survives of artistic embellishments at Stone circles in Britain and Ireland though given the sh amount of rain over the close to 5,000 years of their existence on the landscape as well as the vast amounts of Puritans over the centuries who have sought to remove the devil's influence this comes as no surprise and yet some carvings and art does survive particularly at sites like newrange and Nath in Island's Bo Valley where Myriad swirling patterns have been found as well as on the insides of megalithic tombs in Britany very different to karahan teepe but there [Music] nonetheless but are these sites really all that similar after all karahan Tepe was created by forager hunters and Stonehenge pastoralist farmers and yet it could be argued that these distinctions become somewhat defunct when faced with the great physicality of their Creations in the Tash tppa distinguishing those affluent hunter gatherers from their non- megalith building cousins much more flexible in Social and ideological commitments just as the seasonal Tendencies and relative freedom of movement of the Stonehenge Builders distinguishes them from other much more sedentary urbanized farming populations like in the ancient near East in both societies that of Neolithic Britain and the Tash tea in Southeastern turkey a good deal of seasonal migrations and movement throughout the year seems to have taken [Music] place given the evidence it seems probable that the holy sites were not inhabited at all times but for most people visited at certain times of the year perhaps like Australian aboriginals following so-called dream paths and song lines passed down over the generations to reach the far off holy [Music] centers ancestral knowledge passed down in the form of stories containing deep knowledge of the land and the creatures that dwell within like those visiting Mecca on the Hage maybe some would only visit once in a lifetime for a great Festival others much more often yearly perhaps depending on means or personal persuasion [Music] smaller Stone circles could have been local phenomenons whereas larger ones like kalish the Ring of Broar aere and Stonehenge Havens for much larger conglomerations of travelers all alike unknowingly perhaps harking back to the rituals and dramatic performances of shamanic individuals of the upper Paleolithic at sites like carahan Tepe so many Millennia [Music] before vast performances perhaps being acted out in open air amphitheaters far larger in scale due to the much larger population possible since the adoption of Agriculture but with the older ways of being that enabled that leap in the first place still there like the ritual sites of hunter gatherers those of the Neolithic are very often associated with extraordinary natural features like huge trees impressive rock formations or lakes Stone circles almost always have an incredible view often being placed up high in a prominent location just like at carahan Tepe and perhaps most astonishingly of all it isn't just Eurasia where places like these can be found on the other side of the world in Ancient Japan the Jamon culture which flourished from more than 15,000 years ago until just a few centuries before the Common Era one of the most fascinating hunter gatherer societies on the planet flourished also Building Stone circles some of the largest and most impressive found [Music] anywhere even in ancient North America the astonishing predecessors of the Mississippi and Mound Builders also living a hunter gatherer existence constructed huge monuments in what is now Louisiana at sites like poverty point and Watson [Music] break looking eerily like giant ampy theaters many thousands of years ago Watson break in particular dating to the fourth millennium BC similarly in Peru when the very first urban societies began to coales in the fourth and third Millennia BC on the coastal centers of the nor Chico such as Coral sunen circular enclosures are found along with evidence of feasting activities having taken place musical instruments and the coming together of people to build massive Monumental architecture for the first [Music] time there is an argument then for these phenomena having appeared independently all over the world like pyramids the concept being an obvious one somehow hardwired into how early human groups organized [Music] themselves so then rather than having roots in the Neolithic as often generally assumed all societies on Earth having their roots in the shared cognitive Revolution happening all the way back in the Paleolithic as early as 50,000 years ago ancestors of all human [Music] societies a line of succession being traceable all the way from karahan Tepe in the first days of the hollene to the Stone Circle Builders of the Neolithic and on to the Bronze Age with the open air assembly sites at Manan centers like canosos and cadic holy sanctuaries like dascalo just as the massive Open Air Platform at aguad Phoenix in meso Amica can be seen to trace directly through to the Meer ball courts of a later age perhaps sport ritualized or not played a part at carahan teepe and Stonehenge too as we have seen the term ritual should not be understood now as some sort of autonomous process separate from the everyday it having become something of a joke in archaeological circles due to its apparent overuse we are fundamentally ritualistic animals who place meaning into much of what we do even today ritual is suffused into our everyday lives ashes of a loved one placed on a mantle piece morning coffee and a newspaper [Music] meanings placed on the mundane Comfort gained from a [Music] routine rather than being some separate religious concept from everyday life ritual has always been entangled often merging with politics and the economy individual rituals are one thing but when entire Clans and tribes come together like at carahan teepe or Stonehenge to engage in a group ritual is when things really start to happen such communal Gatherings generating symbolic and social meaning as well as cognitive changes in individuals bringing them on board or further reinforcing faith in a shared story or purpose in the [Music] world though we don't know for sure it is possible that at karahan Tepe time and time again enclosures were constructed in a great ceremonial work followed by perhaps years of Festival like activities with music art storytelling communal dance chanting even psychedelic drugs serving to strengthen realign or even dissolve dependencies between people places things or [Music] Gods a festival that may may be repeated over and over again down the long centuries still making up a firm part of almost every human society today work at carahan teepe and the Tash tea sites is really only just beginning the developments made there over the next Century will undoubtedly continue to Astound again and again breaking the barriers down of what we know and don't know about our direct ancestral past who we are how we came to be and where we are going it's going to be an incredible [Music] ride as always I'm your host Pete Kelly you've been watching history
