" I've been waiting for you I've been waiting for you It's been a long time, baby I've been literally waiting for you I've been waiting for you I've been waiting for you I've been waiting for you Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh I can cast a spell She could you can tell Make a special rule With fire inside of you In a tongue you feel danger I've been instantly I will steal I've been waiting for you It's been a long time, baby I've been waiting for you I've been waiting for you"
