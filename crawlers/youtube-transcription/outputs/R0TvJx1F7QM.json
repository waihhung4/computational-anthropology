"[Music] well it's an honor to be up here usually in an introduction you introduce people to each other this is the BYU audience now I'll get to Dr Norman yafi uh most of you have programs so I will not go over the exciting details of a CV that are summarized here Dr yafi got his undergraduate degree at Northwestern his Advanced degrees at Yale he taught from over 20 years at the University of Arizona and the rest of the time he's being he taught at the University of Michigan even though I advised him not to uh I met Norm I think in the early 1990s when he was just heading to Michigan but but I had been reading his material long before that as you see he's the author of many books and articles he's written two other books on the topic that he's going to be addressing tonight in 1988 he co-edited a book called the collapse of ancient states with George kogil a professor at Arizona State and he's just recently published the book with Patricia mckin questioning collapse human resilience ecological vulnerability and the aftermath of Empire now Dr Yai's been here for a couple days it's been fun to take him to Temple Square and take him across campus and try to give him a little bit of the feel for the Mormon oddness and so we've been having a great time and I've been gossiping with him about all the things that I'm interested in but mostly he tells me I won't I can't answer that I'm going to answer that at the lecture so I'm all excited to hear what he actually has to say about the collapse of ancient civilizations as you read on his CV he's a specialist in the Mesopotamia but he's worked in the southwest and he's a very good theorist so I hope we can learn something from the movies and turn off all your cell phones now if I hear beep I'm going to go find it and throw you out no that's that's all right uh you can use computers but turn off your cell phones and if I could urge you to if you're leaving after the lecture hurry out and then the rest of us can come up close and have a more intimate question and answer period about how civilizations work and why sometimes they don't with Dr y [Applause] I am extremely pleased to be here as a shallot lecturer can you hear me in the back if not start waving and I'll try to speak up um under the offices of the much admir Department of anthropology at BYU and I thank Professor Clark for your generous introduction as Professor Clark has said I've been thinking and writing about collapse for a while and I want to begin by telling you about my own encounters with the subject I began worrying about the collapse of the dynasty of karabi of Babylon in the first half of the second millennium BC I followed the careers of bureaucrats and local leadership structures in Mesopotamian Kor tablets and I was especially interested in the relations of local communities and their Leaders with the state the bureaucracy of the crown all of that was for my dissertation in assyriology studying the languages and history and archaeology of ancient Mesopotamia I thought that in 1973 when I finished my disertation that I was finished with collapse however when I started my first job in the department of anthropology at the University of Arizona I began to consider collapse as part of a larger social evolutionary phenomena as part of larger social evolutionary phenomena the rise and fall of ancient States and comparative perspective I published an article on the subject in 1979 and I thought that was the end of my research on collapse however I received a long letter from Mesoamerican archaeologist George kogal who was intrigued by that article and wondered uh whether my perspective shed any light on Mesoamerican civilizations our further correspondence led us to organizing a conference on the collapse of ancient States at the school of American Research in Santa Fe which was published as John mentioned in 1988 I thought then that I was through with collapse however I began a book on social evolutionary studies on Ancient states that included a part on collapse and that was published in 2005 certainly that would be the end of my work on collapse about a year after that publication Patricia mackenan a Maya archaeologist invited me to a conference on collapse and reference to the work of Jared Diamond's popular book on collapse and I became a co-editor with uh Trisha mackan of that book which appeared in 2009 9 and now I've been asked to come to BYU to talk about what else collapse this interesting collapse that continues is of course because of our modern concerns with global warming and environmental destructions of all sorts and how we might make our own modern society more sustainable and resilient so that it doesn't collapse my adventures with collapse seem destined not to collap collapse at all in fact I've now rethought some fundamental issues and I'm eager to try a few of these out uh today eager might not be the right word however since this is an intimidatingly large and informed uh audience although perhaps not as formidable as the audience at the 1920 conference in Berlin of unemploy Ed Unix who were thrown out of work at the collapse of the Ottoman Empire much of the interest in collapse in archaeology surrounds Jared Diamond's work Diamond might be the most famous Anthropologist archaeologist on the planet at least as far as the public is concerned how many of you have read Diamond either the book guns Germs and Steel or collapse or seen TV programs with diamond so a fair amount in fact diamond is not an archaeologist or an anthropologist he's an ornithologist a physiologist and geographer however he does write a lot better than archaeologists and he is a great spokesman for archaeological research which he doesn't do himself and often misunderstands in some ways Diamond's views are however nicely anthropological in Guns Germs and Steel he tries to explain why there are differences in the civilizations of the world some technologically advanced such as Western Europe and others not Advanced at all such as Oceania or Native America this is nothing to do in Diamond's view with Race by biology and this view of course anthropologists endorse but it has uh to do with geography the West Was triumphant because of the kinds of plants and animals that were indigenous in the near East and then in Europe and which were domesticable and which conferred resistance to disease Native American societies are considered failures in comparison with Europe now all of this is not very historical because if you pick an earlier date the greatest city in the world in 3000 BC was in Iraq in 1500 BC the largest city in the world was in China and in ad500 the greatest city was in Mexico and in ad500 the greatest Empire was in South America in ad. 2500 the greatest cities and the most prosperous nations may not be in the west at all and anyway what is failure and success at least one historian considers the worst Century in human history if we are grading according to Wars suffering and callous massacres of human beings it was the 20th century ad but history is not a report card of success and failure in Diamond's collapse how societies choose to succeed or fail he is concerned with global warming and the risks to Modern civilizations Diamond gleans the archaeological literature to show that the world in which we live was not all that different from the past he subscribes to Santana's famous dictum those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it if we do not learn from the mistakes of History we are doomed to repeat them since according to Diamond many civilizations collapse because of environmental mismanagement we must learn from these collapses and we must not engineer our own disaster not make short-term decisions that ignore long-term stability especially environmental stability archaeologist for archaeologists there's another quotation that resonates loudly in modern research it is William Faulkner's claim that the past is never dead it is not even past that is for modern archaeologists it's not enough to reconstruct the past Trace changes over time explain why some things happened um uh at least as well as we think they did for the past really isn't over but what are archaeologists to do with the present past of course our archaeologists do want to get it right I'll review some cases uh presented more fully in uh that maani and yafi book uh on uh collapse to show that diamond hasn't got it right but there are other questions that are important how do we learn from the past and what do we do with archaeological knowledge in the present the answers may be surprising I want to begin with some examples of the undead past in my own area of research ancient Iraq Mesopotamia um you can see that ancient Mesopotamia is pretty much the borders of modern Iraq in the lower part of the map I don't think it will be possible to follow that small laser point but there is a site called logos I want to show you some of the finds from logos about 2400 BC here is an object called the Stila of the vultures it shows a large figure um which can be interpreted either as a God the god of logos or the king AUM himself uh in this seene holding a net with captives and holding a h a symbol of a mythological bird um and here is a line drawing of this scene um with the bird and the captives in the net and presumably uh the god in The Chariot and uh possibly the king in uh in front of the chariot now it so happens that bird is pretty well known in Mesopotamian literature and indeed we have depictions in gold and Lapis Liley precisely of this magical bird the bird was defeated by the god of logos in a famous myth after which it became the symbol of the king and of the city now the other side of the Stila has this picture of a failan of soldiers led by the king and uh in the lower part of the slide and in the very upper part you can see it is inscribed so we can actually read some of what uh the king inscribes as to his victory over a neighboring City uh which uh was a light motif of the experiences of the kings of logos I show you that particular scene because it has been appropriated in the present there it is that failan of soldiers with uh the one of the most recent rulers of Iraq Saddam Hussein who is very happy to say that he is a successor to the glories of the ancient Kings of Mesopotamia the like an Kings of ancient Iraq themselves so is the fast dead or is it used for political purposes let me show you this map again um more or less in the middle of it is about there it's a town called Kish it hasn't been occupied for 2,000 years but here we see a highway sign saying turn right to get to Kish why in the world would we have a highway sign in a modern Iraqi Highway leading to this ancient site was it a just a tourist attraction here is the site itself in plan at around 2500 BC it was around 4 uh kilometers squared with at least 20,000 people and we know from the archaeology and from the texts also from this period it could easily claimed to be the largest and most powerful City not only in Mesopotamia but the world I want to show you a little of the excavations that occurred the French excavated the place in 1911 and 192 they were intending to go back but World War I interrupted that plan and from 1923 to 1933 an expedition from the University of Oxford in England and the Chicago Field Museum excavated for 10 years at the site up at the very top you see a a temple from around 600 BC emerging and as you go down you go through time back to around 3000 BC when the site was in effect founded those are not natural Hills those are the ruins of Kish and these are only a small part of the ruins of Kish it like all early Mesopotamian cities is gigantic and archaeologists have only uncovered easily less than 1% of it and you can see from the previous slide of the stratagraph problems of trying to have a large horizontal exposure contemporary buildings at any one time at Kish now on top of that tall mount on the right there's something that I have no idea what it is here is a shot 80 years later of I think the same exact place in Kish and you see there is again something on the top of the mound but we know what that is it's an American Army bivac at Kish that used it the ancient site as a modern military base and here is a soldier uh showing you some of the ruins of Kish that have been unexcavated the Chicago Field Museum now called The Natural History Museum is under taking a project to accumulate and digitize all the artifacts from Kish this was publicized in the Chicago Tribune a soldier from Chicago in Iraq saw that and sent that picture to the field Muse the Natural History Museum at Chicago who uh uh and where colleagues sent it on to me now in the countryside in modern Iraq uh there is hardly any political stability at all and here is a satellite picture of looting in one small site you can see bulldozzer tracks leading into it and um uh uh locals are essentially pirating out of economic necessity uh their own past in order to uh find tablets uh and also artifacts that they could sell on the Antiquities Market one of the ironies of History might be that that American Military bivwak and Kish was in fact protecting it from Modern lutters let me show you some Mesopotamian tablets um these are very early ones uh as writing was invented around 3200 BC there were some precursors uh to writing but the writing wrting system uh was invented it seems in a moment as it were and perhaps even by one person because as my academic colleagues like to think of it could you imagine a committee inventing writing here is a later tablet in an envelope um we can read people's mail at the distance of uh two uh 4,000 Thousand Years some of these tablets uh were written on and then enclosed in a sheath of clay in which uh the same tablet the same information was recorded So if there was a legal challenge you could break open the envelope and read the um the uh the the real tablet uh that had been enclosed in that clay sheath that envelope I was very pleased to see in the museum of people's cultures this morning that there are um about a dozen clay tablets from Mesopotamia in the collections of that uh very fine Museum uh Mesopotamians wrote everything they wrote letters they wrote Royal inscriptions they wrote myths they wrote epics they wrote lawsuits they wrote contracts contracts of sale rental marriage divorce uh almost anything thing you can think of they wrote on clay and these clay tablets are incredibly durable think of a pot you might be able to smash it into pieces but you it's very hard actually to destroy and that is so for clay tablets now think of our media of communication paper that is going to disappear very quickly over time and think of computer media that is also going to disappear so the point is if you want something to last for a long time you want to write it on Clay uh also uh if there is some disaster in uh in Provo and the city somehow disappears and is excavated by archaeologists about a thousand years thereafter they're not going to find any paper they're not going to find these anything in the ruins of the library they're not going to find any computer media tapes or discs or anything like that but they're going to find about a dozen clay tablets in the ruins of the Museum of peoples and cultures and they may conclude that Provo was a very far Outpost of Mesopotamian civilization I'm going to return to Mesopotamia the area I know best or at least have the most images of a little bit later but I want to review for you some of the case studies and the question questioning collapse book with a few other observations to talk about um the theme of collapse whoops first no first I'm going to uh the Pacific um I have a colleague who works in Oceania and he shows such a slide at the start of his lectures he says this is my field area it's half the globe and going to talk about Easter Island you can see the arrow in the lower right pointing to Easter Island um here is a bit of a map showing how Easter Island was settled from the West at around 12200 a Easter Island is the island that is the the most distant from any other occupied place on Earth it is 3,000 kilometers west of Chile which uh is the government of Easter Island and it's 2,000 kilometers away from sorry from pitar Islands you can see the closest Islands next to eastern island this is Jared Diamond's most dramatic case of collapse as engineered destruction by by the people who lived on Easter Island or rapanui as it's called in the language of Easter Island itself now these are the most famous artifacts from Easter Island these very large um monuments called Moi and for Diamond the issue is that Easter Islanders deforested their Island and this led to EOS side as he puts it and cultural collapse to quote diamond in just a few centuries the people of Easter Island wiped out their Forest drove their plants and animals to Extinction saw their complex society spiral into chaos and cannibalism in case anybody misses the point are we about to follow their lead by destroying our environment well indeed the paleobotanical research on Easter Island shows that it was in fact deforested and that had implications for those large carved monuments these moai some of which are 10 m High weigh up to 5 tons the point is that some of these trees this Palm Forest were cut down in in order to use them as rollers or sleds to bring the moai from where they were quarried to the place where they were erected in that Monumental way and here is rapanui Easter Island uh today uh indeed the place was deforested for Diamond as he puts it What was The Islander thinking of when he cut down the last tree well Easter Islanders are Polynesians that were they were farmers they brought plants from other regions cultivated them and they certainly cut down and burned forests as part of agricultural practices the same as the English did on the American east coast they cut down forests in order to plant things there was something else brought by the Easter Islanders in their migration to Easter Island they probably came from um the maresa islands there are some cultural items and the language itself of the maresa islands about 2,000 kilometers away related to the language of rapanui they brought rats either they brought them as food or they were stowaways on boats and indeed we saw a Clipper ship at Temple Square the other day which if you look in the rafters you saw rats uh rats are very good at getting transported on boats here is one of the favorite foods of the rats a palm nut every Palm nut that is found in archaeological context is gwed as you see those GW marks on the top of the Palm nut it is suggested that the that population was explosive and rapon rapanui within a few Generations there were millions of rats feasting on Palm nuts and this according to Terry hunt professor at the University of Hawaii is the most important part in the deforestation of rapanui once those nuts were eaten the palm trees could not regenerate in fact the population growth is estimated always a tricky thing to do in archaeological context at rapanui as growing fairly steadily then leveling off a little under 4500 people until 1722 what happened in 1722 a Dutch ship landed on Easter Island and consorting with the local rapanan uh uh led to a transmission of European diseases and an enormous demographic catastrophe for rapanan if we talk about collapse it is because of European contact now Terry hunt this is a slide from him the Hawaii Professor talks about uh this is not ecocide as Diamond put it but genocide this is I think the wrong use of the term genocide but he is very dramatically using the term to show that it wasn't Easter Islanders who caused their own collapse as Diamond had it but it was because of European contact I now want to say a few words about Maya uh collapses I do so with uh trepidation BYU as you probably know is one of the foremost institutions in the world in the study of the Ancient Maya and a good deal of about of what I'm about to say comes from my reading of BYU Scholars and I can only hope that I haven't screwed it up this is a of course a scene an advertisement for Mel Gibson's picture Apocalypto the film shows um a Maya War basically where Maya one Maya City takes captives um engages in human sacrifices and behaves in general despicably uh all of which somehow doesn't seem to endear the film to Maya archaeologists I'm not sure why since they know that the Maya did prec prely those sorts of things for Gibson the whole point of the film is to say that uh Europeans and Christianity saved the Maya from their own bad behavior here is the opposite view of the ma the ma are kind of favorites for projecting uh Strange Behaviors and this is the Star Wars view of uh tall uh uh probably the best known of the classic Maya uh cities where uh uh the and this is appeals to new agers who kind of hold the old views uh no longer accepted by Scholars at the Maya were really peaceful philosophers and astronomers who contemplated the heavens and may even have some relation to people from outer space uh here is a map of classic Maya site so from around 200 to 900 or so I simply want to point out that there there is a distinction between the Central Area uh more or less the paten province in Guatemala and the Northern Area more or less the Yucatan Peninsula of today's uh Mexico uh here is a scene at tal that I'm going to return to a bit later just to give you an idea of pyramids and ceremonial places and here is a Stila from the side of Copan in Honduras in fact but here is a a those are in the central area that peten state here we're up in the north now at chichan itah where there's something that looks like a good classic Maya pyramid but there are also constructions at Chichen of buildings um uh which are not Maya at all but are Mexican toltech if you want so when one talks about the collapse of Maya cities uh which is clear it happened over uh you know in Maya cities over decades or a hundred or so years these May well have been done have occurred as a a result of droughts increased volcanic activity that's the newest Theory I've been reading about and not least the over centralized and expensive Maya religion that required much support in labor and resources from the countryside the last word about the Maya collapse has certainly not been written but one thing you can say about the Maya is that they didn't choose to fail there are still about 8 million Maya living today in Guatemala bise and Mexico and historically the Maya were the last people to be conquered in the region by the Spanish and indeed some Maya are still fighting governments in the region today in this last Maya image another repre of tial what I want to point out is especially that pit at the base of the pyramid it's not an ancient installation at all it's a modern fire pit as the modern Maya who live in and around T call celebrate their own history before the ruins of their past in other words they are connecting the modern Maya with their ancient uh descendants who built these amazing cities this is a point I want to return to in a bit but right now I want to emphasize that when we talk about collapse or we question collapse we must discuss how ideologies and belief systems in the past can be and were malleable as the example of the Persistence of Maya culture has been in the case of Chichen and other Northern cities by amalgamating Maya culture with Mexican culture cities were and uh persist persisted uh whereas other cities that did not change uh didn't moving to the American southwest I want to show a picture of choco Canyon it which is in Northern and uh Western New Mexico that's it up there from about a 800 to 1125 thereabouts there were a number of Pueblo like structures that dotted this choco Canyon area in an unprecedented concentration of buildings uh uh in Southwestern prehistory either before the time of choco or after the time of choco there was no such concentration of buildings such as in chako here are a number of plans of great houses um that existed at chako and here is an overhead view of peblo Bonito you there okay sorry uh there it is in plan in the upper right hand part of the slide there it is overhead and you can see hair trigger just up the canyon another of the great houses uh uh and there were 14 uh alog together of these um uh contemporary large structures okay that is the uh Pueblo Bonito again which was reconstructed in part it's at the height five stories tall there are lots and lots of rooms and there are lots of round buildings some of which might have been ritual structures now the story of choco Canyon is very complicated it seems to have been a pilgrimage site there were very few people who actually lived in Taco Canyon and most of those great houses don't have any domestic uh facilities no Hearth cooking uh features and so forth and in choco uh the choco phenomenon included not just all these buildings in choco Canyon but many outlying settlements ranging over a 100 kilometers that use the same kind of architecture um as choco Canyon and some of these settlements had roads ceremonial type roads that led in the direction of choco Canyon from their own uh living Pueblo so there was something big going on in choco Canyon that United culturally a large swath of the Four Corners region in the southwest between 81150 or so ad now there were leaders at ch o Canyon there was wealth of a sort in choco Canyon and there were longdistance connections of choin with people near and far including um trade uh with distant regions in meso America because Maca that only grow in southern Mexico were found in choco and chocolate uh that also comes from southern Mexico has recently been identified in choco Canyon it seems that people from all over the Four Corners region traveled to choco in Summers for ceremonies that connected them in a chako and belief system it was something like the Vatican of the Southwest and in this slide you see one of the largest the largest actually ceremonial structure in chako and in this sign that structure casarin kadaa is considered by modern Pueblo Indians to be an ancestral site their identity is bound up in some ways with ancient choco Canyon now no man-made environmental catastro catastrophe brought choco to an end as Diamond alludes part of the reason was climate change a decades long drought in the 12th century after which choco was a abandoned but an important part of this collapse was the failure of the chowin belief system the system that held all this region of chako together how do we know this we have oral histories from Modern puebloans who tell their stories about chako and we have archaeological artifacts ritual uh artifacts that show the kinds of changes that occurred after the collapse of chako and archaeologists today take these oral histories of modern Native Americans very seriously indeed these oral histories relate how people in previous times meaning chako overstepped the boundaries set by the gods and the gods thus abandoned chako after chakon some new settlements arose fairly quickly a few of them in Imitation of the great houses of chako but many new settlements were established a new belief system arose and a system that opposed the grandios aspirations of the leaders of chako here is just a map of some Modern Pueblo communities many of which have stories about a previous world that looks like choco and here is a Kina doll it's made by hopes and used at least this one is used to teach children about the supernatural universe and this system of cinas was created around 1300 ad not from nothing but with much symbolism that was in fact invented and was very very different than choco I have to tell you the story that I was at a site called homolovi near Winslow Arizona which the Hopi regard as an ancestral site and which dates to a little bit before 1300 ad at least some of the sites that holvi do I was visiting colleagues from the University of Arizona who are Excavating at the site and as I was visiting a cach of objects was found and the archaeologists called over a couple of teenage hopes who were working uh at the site with the archaeologists and the young Hopi said the as one thing came out of the ground I know what that is that's uh something or other H but he he said then but that's very strange because this something or other always goes with this other thing five minutes later the other thing came out of the ground this is a site that is 700 years before uh these modern hopes in their beliefs but it was invented then and it's part of the Hy belief system today and there are other sites too and other finds that have been excavated in the 12th century uh ad and which modern Pueblo Indians can interpret very well because it's part of their belief system today so what was invented after choco Canyon um is essentially the uh belief system that works in Pueblo's about today well what's the point about talking of about the collapse of choco yes the great houses were abandoned and we can study drought and failures of leadership and so forth but I think it's far more interesting and certainly more important to tell the story of Native American survival resilience adaptability and the construction of more sustainable societies and maybe we should even be talking about heroism especially if we extend the story to experiences with European and American Invaders in the southwest I now want to return to Mesopotamia with an example of collapse that has nothing to do with environmental mismanagement and failure and indeed it's a story about the ironies of political success I'm going to tell you the story only in outline of course but fortunately you have experts on ancient Mesopotamia at BYU and you can go to them and hear the rest of the story as uh Paul what's his name Paul Harvey used to say thank you I pointed to out to you the southern cities of logos and Kish in the very south here and now I'm going to talk about the north which is ancient Assyria uh it's called ass Syria after one of its capitals ashure and also the national deity who was called ashure now also on this map note the site of Kes which is way off in more or less the middle of turkey which we call the Asiatic part we call Anatolia I want to start out by talking about the old Assyrian period which is a period we know mainly from trade and here are some of the trade routs from ashure in Northern Iraq to kanes and to other uh places in Anatolia that were like Kesh in fact Kesh was a trade Colony set up by the Assyrians near a larger Anatolian site but it was a colony without colonialism since the Assyrians lived in Anatolia under the suffrage of Anatolian rulers they didn't conquer the place they were just trading with it now Assyrians took donkey Caravans from aure to Anatolia and other outposts they traded tin which is needed for the production of bronze and textiles uh and four silver and gold which were plentiful in Anatolia a and the people who traded were entrepreneurs this was not State controlled trade but these were people who made money on longdistance trade moving materials from where they were plentiful to where they were scarce but it's not economics I want to talk about today in Old Assyrian Society there were Kings definitely but there were other people involved in governmental Affairs in Assyria there were there was for example a city hall and there were assemblies or councils of big men and small men as the texts reported and the system of dating in Assyria was after important people uh not Kings and their lieutenants in the land in brief there was a kind of sharing of power and this hierarchy attempts to explain how that worked there was a palace and there were Kings but there were also councils and Nobles as well as a temple Administration all of that those people were Assyrians that changed in the middle Assyrian period we find that Kings have a great deal more power because they were at the start of the period fighting neighbors for their own independence and in order to do so they centralized their state we don't read of assemblies anymore and we do read of new importance of the army which had initially uh freed the Assyrians from their neighbors whom they were fighting um uh but turned into a military force for expansion soon thereafter one Assyrian King ulti nura built a new capital and we read that he was assassinated for this act of hubris by the nobility in Assyria which still existed but was in the process of being disenfranchised by the king's own nobles and army officers so this is an attempt to depict the middle Assyrian hierarchy let us say around 1300 BC the old Assyrians were around 1800 BC and you see that the Neo Assyrian Society was hierarchized more or less directly under the authority of the palace although there were Nobles and gentry who could rise up to resist policies of the king now we go to the Neo Assyrian period where the Assyrian army is triumphant the Assyrians conquer most of the ancient near East all the way into Egypt and they build new capitals the new bureaucrats are officers of the army they are granted large lands uh for their new ranks and they have new people to work these kinds of lands um here are a couple of images of door Bulls you may have seen and one of the capitals new capitals that had to be built freshly in the Neo Assyrian period as the new Palace of a newly an immensely strong King this is what the Assyrian hierarchy um hypothetically looked like uh the king and the palace were were at the top the Army and the generals were increasingly important bureaucrats new capitals were built and if you notice at the bottom um a many of the laborers on these new capitals were people that the Assyrians had defeated in battle perhaps the most famous episode of people that the Assyrians had uh subjugated and then deported as l laborers to build capitals and to work on Estates were the tribes of Israel the Israel the the king of Israel refused to pay tribute to the Assyrian army he came down defeated them and their Capital Samaria and we read in the texts of the tens of thousands of people who were deported in 722 BC by the king Sargon II into the Syrian Heartland to work on those new capitals and to be field laborers the old line nobility in Assyria had been eradicated the countryside consisted of large lands that were given to generals and high bureaucrats the people who work this land and who are the majority in Assyrian capitals were not Assyrians did not share Assyrian culture did not speak the Assyrian language and mainly spoke Aramaic um uh and came from the areas that Assyria had conquered when the Assyrian army was defeated by old and new enemies in 614 through 610 uh BC there was no regeneration from this collapse as we had seen in these previous regenerations the urban capitals lay in Ruins and the top levels of this high hierarchy had been removed as part of the collapse indeed the only things left were the lower end of the hierarchy Villages which were populated by non Assyrians so the answer to why the Assyrian state did not regenerate was that the very success of Assyrian rulers had destroyed the basis of Assyrian culture the elimination of the nobility and Merchant classes in order to become a more efficient military State finally resulted in the submersion of their own culture but history offers no Assurance of finality what um there was no environmental destruction and it was the policies of successful Assyrian kings that had destroyed their uh their own culture but is this collapse to total here in Chicago is a monument it says in memoriam of Assyrian Martyrs since some descendants of those Aramaic speakers that had been deported to Assyria converted to Christianity and eventually formed the Church of the East not part of the Roman church but of the Eastern Orthodox church today however they call themselves Assyrians and their Church the Assyrian church because they're proud of their relation to ancient Assyria even though their beliefs and languages have little to do with historic uh ancient Assyria let me try to wrap all of this up first the past is not dead this is already well known it is the past is used by politicians for their own purposes as I showed in a couple of slides in Mesopotamia but could tell such stories from all over the world also modern identities are inextricably tied to their understandings of the past and these understandings have been created by archaeologists no one knew about Assyria before archaeologists in the 19th century brought the civilization to life there were a few odd references of course about Assyria in the Hebrew Bible and in Greek histories but these were often uh very garbled as we know from reading the original documents from the land themselves so archaeologists are the midwives of memory conferring the power of the past to live again second there is a responsibility for archaeologist to get things right at least to make sure that the data are analyzed and ordered as best we can pyramids were not built by aliens from outer space and collapses were not caused by people ruining their environment Diamond's story is a fairy tale of the past the new element in the responsibilities of archaeologist to work with the descendants of ancient people looms ever larger for modern archaeologists as we learn from them as well as sharing our knowledge of the past with them third it is clear that diamond and archaeologists concerned with global warming are concerned with global warming uh and en Environmental Management archaeologists are just as concerned about these things as Jared Diamond but it is the case that ancient people did not have the capability of destroying their entire environments although humans certainly did alter their environments sometimes enormously it was simply impossible for humans to affect their environments in the scale we can do so today the warnings about Global Environmental change are not that we are going to suffer the the same fate as ancient civilizations because there is no precedent for the kinds of environmental destructions we face today and this is all the more reason to take action in our day fourth the history of ancient States shows that we can appreciate the long course of humans who solved problems in the past and still survive today we have many examples of people who learn to change their ways the challenge es ahead for us are profound and require inspired problem solving and human resilience it may be optimistic but one can hope that our leaders and people across the globe are now responding to the challenges we have before us Fifth and finally the entire problem of collapse has perhaps been falsely conceiv by popular writers like Jared Diamond but also many archaeologists collapse tends to imply that ancient states were relatively stable and well governed with leaders who understood their societies nothing seems further from the truth collapse was not an exception to the rule of stability and to explain collapse we must find stresses and unusual conditions either external like climatic change or internal like resistance to unjust rule ancient States all of them were rather unstable ramshackle and always changing dynasties fell various social and ethnic groups struggled for power enemies appeared who were themselves on the periphery of ancient States and who alternately were attacked by the armies of those States or were lured by the wealth of states with which they came into contact in archaeology we often speak of the evolution of complex societies meaning the evolution of states and state-like societies perhaps we should change our perspective 180 de and discuss rather the evolution of fragility collapse certainly would look very different if we did thank you [Applause] "
