"There's something about caves -- a shadowy opening in a limestone\ncliff that draws you in. As you pass through the portal\nbetween light and dark, you enter a subterranean world -- a place of perpetual gloom,\nof earthy smells, of hushed silence. Long ago in Europe, ancient people also entered\nthese underground worlds. As witness to their passage, they left behind mysterious\nengravings and paintings, like this panel of humans, triangles\nand zigzags from Ojo Guare\u00f1a in Spain. You now walk the same path\nas these early artists. And in this surreal, otherworldly place, it's almost possible to imagine that you hear the muffled footfall\nof skin boots on soft earth, or that you see the flickering of a torch\naround the next bend. When I'm in a cave, I often find myself wondering\nwhat drove these people to go so deep to brave dangerous and narrow\npassageways to leave their mark? In this video clip, that was shot half a kilometer,\nor about a third of a mile, underground, in the cave of Cudon in Spain, we found a series\nof red paintings on a ceiling in a previously unexplored\nsection of the cave. As we crawled forward, military-style,\nwith the ceiling getting ever lower, we finally got to a point\nwhere the ceiling was so low that my husband\nand project photographer, Dylan, could no longer achieve focus\non the ceiling with his DSLR camera. So while he filmed me, I kept following the trail of red paint\nwith a single light and a point-and-shoot camera\nthat we kept for that type of occasion. Half a kilometer underground. Seriously. What was somebody doing down there\nwith a torch or a stone lamp? (Laughter) I mean -- me, it makes sense, right? But you know, this is the kind of question that\nI'm trying to answer with my research. I study some of the oldest\nart in the world. It was created by these\nearly artists in Europe, between 10,000 and 40,000 years ago. And the thing is that I'm not just studying it\nbecause it's beautiful, though some of it certainly is. But what I'm interested in\nis the development of the modern mind, of the evolution of creativity,\nof imagination, of abstract thought, about what it means to be human. While all species communicate\nin one way or another, only we humans have really\ntaken it to another level. Our desire and ability\nto share and collaborate has been a huge part of our success story. Our modern world is based on a global\nnetwork of information exchange made possible, in large part,\nby our ability to communicate -- in particular, using graphic\nor written forms of communication. The thing is, though, that we've been building\non the mental achievements of those that came before us for so long that it's easy to forget that certain\nabilities haven't already existed. It's one of the things\nI find most fascinating about studying our deep history. Those people didn't have the shoulders\nof any giants to stand on. They were the original shoulders. And while a surprising number\nof important inventions come out of that distant time, what I want to talk to you about today\nis the invention of graphic communication. There are three\nmain types of communication, spoken, gestural --\nso things like sign language -- and graphic communication. Spoken and gestural are\nby their very nature ephemeral. It requires close contact\nfor a message to be sent and received. And after the moment\nof transmission, it's gone forever. Graphic communication, on the other hand,\ndecouples that relationship. And with its invention,\nit became possible for the first time for a message to be\ntransmitted and preserved beyond a single moment in place and time. Europe is one of the first places that we start to see graphic marks\nregularly appearing in caves, rock shelters\nand even a few surviving open-air sites. But this is not the Europe we know today. This was a world dominated\nby towering ice sheets, three to four kilometers high, with sweeping grass plains\nand frozen tundra. This was the Ice Age. Over the last century, more than 350 Ice Age rock art sites\nhave been found across the continent, decorated with animals, abstract shapes\nand even the occasional human like these engraved figures\nfrom Grotta dell'Addaura in Sicily. They provide us with a rare glimpse into the creative world and imagination\nof these early artists. Since their discovery, it's been the animals that have received\nthe majority of the study like this black horse\nfrom Cullalvera in Spain, or this unusual purple bison\nfrom La Pasiega. But for me, it was the abstract shapes,\nwhat we call geometric signs, that drew me to study the art. The funny this is that at most sites the geometric signs far outnumber\nthe animal and human images. But when I started on this back in 2007, there wasn't even a definitive list\nof how many shapes there were, nor was there a strong sense of whether the same ones\nappeared across space or time. Before I could even\nget started on my questions, my first step was to compile a database of all known geometric signs\nfrom all of the rock art sites. The problem was that while they were\nwell documented at some sites, usually the ones\nwith the very nice animals, there was also a large number of them\nwhere it was very vague -- there wasn't a lot\nof description or detail. Some of them hadn't been visited\nin half a century or more. These were the ones\nthat I targeted for my field work. Over the course of two years, my faithful husband Dylan and I\neach spent over 300 hours underground, hiking, crawling and wriggling\naround 52 sites in France, Spain, Portugal and Sicily. And it was totally worth it. We found new, undocumented geometric signs\nat 75 percent of the sites we visited. This is the level of accuracy\nI knew I was going to need if I wanted to start answering\nthose larger questions. So let's get to those answers. Barring a handful of outliers,\nthere are only 32 geometric signs. Only 32 signs across a 30,000-year time span\nand the entire continent of Europe. That is a very small number. Now, if these were random\ndoodles or decorations, we would expect to see\na lot more variation, but instead what we find\nare the same signs repeating across both space and time. Some signs start out strong,\nbefore losing popularity and vanishing, while other signs are later inventions. But 65 percent of those signs stayed\nin use during that entire time period -- things like lines, rectangles\ntriangles, ovals and circles like we see here\nfrom the end of the Ice Age, at a 10,000-year-old site\nhigh in the Pyrenees Mountains. And while certain signs\nspan thousands of kilometers, other signs had much more\nrestricted distribution patterns, with some being limited\nto a single territory, like we see here\nwith these divided rectangles that are only found in northern Spain, and which some researchers have speculated could be some sort\nof family or clan signs. On a side note, there is surprising degree\nof similarity in the earliest rock art found all the way from France and Spain\nto Indonesia and Australia. With many of the same signs\nappearing in such far-flung places, especially in that 30,000\nto 40,000-year range, it's starting to seem increasingly likely that this invention actually traces back\nto a common point of origin in Africa. But that I'm afraid,\nis a subject for a future talk. So back to the matter at hand. There could be no doubt that these signs\nwere meaningful to their creators, like these 25,000-year-old\nbas-relief sculptures from La Roque de Venasque in France. We might not know what they meant,\nbut the people of the time certainly did. The repetition of the same signs,\nfor so long, and at so many sites tells us that the artists\nwere making intentional choices. If we're talking about geometric shapes, with specific, culturally recognized,\nagreed-upon meanings, than we could very well be looking at one of the oldest systems\nof graphic communication in the world. I'm not talking about writing yet. There's just not enough\ncharacters at this point to have represented all of the words\nin the spoken language, something which is a requirement\nfor a full writing system. Nor do we see the signs\nrepeating regularly enough to suggest that they were\nsome sort of alphabet. But what we do have\nare some intriguing one-offs, like this panel from La Pasiega in Spain,\nknown as \"The Inscription,\" with its symmetrical markings on the left, possible stylized representations\nof hands in the middle, and what looks a bit\nlike a bracket on the right. The oldest systems of graphic\ncommunication in the world -- Sumerian cuneiform, Egyptian hieroglyphs,\nthe earliest Chinese script, all emerged between 4,000\nand 5,000 years ago, with each coming into existence\nfrom an earlier protosystem made up of counting marks\nand pictographic representations, where the meaning\nand the image were the same. So a picture of a bird would really\nhave represented that animal. It's only later that we start to see\nthese pictographs become more stylized, until they almost become unrecognizable and that we also start to see\nmore symbols being invented to represent all those other\nmissing words in language -- things like pronouns, adverbs, adjectives. So knowing all this, it seems highly unlikely that\nthe geometric signs from Ice Age Europe were truly abstract written characters. Instead, what's much more likely is that these early artists\nwere also making counting marks, maybe like this row of lines\nfrom Riparo di Za Minic in Sicily, as well as creating\nstylized representations of things from the world around them. Could some of the signs\nbe weaponry or housing? Or what about celestial objects\nlike star constellations? Or maybe even rivers, mountains,\ntrees -- landscape features, possibly like this black penniform\nsurrounded by strange bell-shaped signs from the site of El Castillo in Spain. The term penniform\nmeans \"feather-shaped\" in Latin, but could this actually be\na depiction of a plant or a tree? Some researchers have begun\nto ask these questions about certain signs at specific sites, but I believe the time has come\nto revisit this category as a whole. The irony in all of this, of course, is that having just carefully classified\nall of the signs into a single category, I have a feeling that my next step\nwill involve breaking it back apart as different types of imagery\nare identified and separated off. Now don't get me wrong, the later creation\nof fully developed writing was an impressive feat in its own right. But it's important to remember that those early writing systems\ndidn't come out of a vacuum. And that even 5,000 years ago, people were already building\non something much older, with its origins stretching back\ntens of thousands of years -- to the geometric signs\nof Ice Age Europe and far beyond, to that point, deep\nin our collective history, when someone first came up with the idea\nof making a graphic mark, and forever changed the nature\nof how we communicate.
