"The Great Wall of China and the famous\u00a0\nterracotta army vividly symbolize the power\u00a0\u00a0 of ancient China\u2014to the point that they have\u00a0\neven been featured in movies . In The Mummy:\u00a0\u00a0 Tomb of the Dragon Emperor , a 2008 release\u00a0\nthat did no honor to the 1999 classic,\u00a0\u00a0 the army even came back to life .\nThe historical creator of the\u00a0\u00a0 real terracotta army, the first\u00a0\nemperor of China, Qin Shi Huang,\u00a0\u00a0 probably conscripted some 700,000 workers to\u00a0\ncreate his massive mausoleum. It covers an area\u00a0\u00a0 of about 56 square kilometers and includes the\u00a0\nterracotta army, with its 8,000 clay soldiers,\u00a0\u00a0 130 chariots, and nearly 800 horses. These\u00a0\nfigures represent China's army at the time,\u00a0\u00a0 an army more powerful than China had ever had.\u00a0\nThis army allowed Qin Shi Huang, the king of Qin,\u00a0\u00a0 to unite the warring states of China and unify\u00a0\nthem under his rule as the first emperor.\u00a0 Before Qin Shi Huang unified China, the region\u00a0\nconsisted of seven states that struggled for\u00a0\u00a0 power. This era, known as the warring states\u00a0\nperiod, is the subject of many Chinese myths,\u00a0\u00a0 legends, and even modern movies. For example, in\u00a0\nthe film genre wuxia history and legend blur. A\u00a0\u00a0 famous example is the 2002 film Hero, starring\u00a0\nJet Li. Mythological and historical elements\u00a0\u00a0 are linked not only in popular media but also in\u00a0\nhow the Chinese perceive their history. To get a\u00a0\u00a0 clear view of China's early history, we need to\u00a0\nuntangle the history from the myth. To do that,\u00a0\u00a0 we will jump back even further, and take a\u00a0\nlook at how the sparsely populated China of\u00a0\u00a0 the Stone Age developed into a complex network of\u00a0\nwarring states and, eventually, a mighty empire.\u00a0 Chapter 1: The First Traces of War\nAbout 12,000 years ago, the ice from\u00a0\u00a0 the last Ice Age melted. The hunter-gatherers\u00a0\nthat had lived in East Asia for more than 100,000\u00a0\u00a0 years began to settle near rivers and swamps,\u00a0\nespecially in the south of present-day China\u00a0\u00a0 and along the Yangtze and Yellow Rivers. Over the\u00a0\nfollowing millennia, they developed a sedentary\u00a0\u00a0 way of life based on agriculture. People lived\u00a0\ntogether in clans; cultivated millet, cabbage,\u00a0\u00a0 and hemp; and raised pigs, dogs, and chickens.\u00a0\nAs usually happens when permanent settlements\u00a0\u00a0 are established, the increasing contact between\u00a0\ntribes and cultures led to conflicts and therefore\u00a0\u00a0 the need for protection. For this reason,\u00a0\npeople soon built low stone walls or ditches\u00a0\u00a0 around their settlements. At first, these had\u00a0\na double function: they prevented livestock\u00a0\u00a0 from wandering off, and they were an obstacle for\u00a0\nraiders. Somewhat later, in the Middle Stone Age,\u00a0\u00a0 which lasted from about 7,000 to 5,000 BC in\u00a0\nChina, the first earthen ramparts, combined\u00a0\u00a0 with ditches, emerged in the Yangtze River basin.\u00a0\nThey primarily served a military function, making\u00a0\u00a0 them the first indisputable traces of violent\u00a0\nconflict between groups in China. According\u00a0\u00a0 to the historian Kauschik Roy, these initial\u00a0\nconflicts mainly involved small-scale fighting\u00a0\u00a0 between villages, cattle raids, and feuds.\nThe fortified settlements turned into cities\u00a0\u00a0 throughout the next millennia, and their small\u00a0\nearthen walls became impressive fortifications.\u00a0\u00a0 One of the numerous Neolithic cultures found\u00a0\nin China , the Liangzhu culture, was located\u00a0\u00a0 in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River around\u00a0\n3,300\u20132,300 BC and is known to have had cities of\u00a0\u00a0 up to 30,000 people. The Longshan culture also\u00a0\nhad large cities and, in the 3rd millennium BC,\u00a0\u00a0 massive ramparts of rammed earth that were up\u00a0\nto 25m wide. This construction technique was\u00a0\u00a0 still used in China about four millennia later\u00a0\nwhen the Ming built their capitals in Nanjing\u00a0\u00a0 and Beijing. The sheer size of these cities and\u00a0\nfortifications makes clear that the Liangzhu and\u00a0\u00a0 Longshan cultures were complex communities that\u00a0\nhad mastered many cultural skills. These included,\u00a0\u00a0 for example, the cultivation of rice, practiced\u00a0\nsince about 7,000 BC, especially in southern\u00a0\u00a0 China; the production of silk; and the processing\u00a0\nof bronze, which began around 3,000 BC. The\u00a0\u00a0 introduction of bronze work was accompanied by\u00a0\nnew technologies that decisively changed art,\u00a0\u00a0 agriculture and, not least, warfare.\nBut before we dive right into the depths\u00a0\u00a0 of Chinese history, take a moment and relax:\u00a0\nlook, cold turkey may be great on sandwiches,\u00a0\u00a0 but there\u2019s a better way to break your bad habits.\u00a0\nAnd right now I\u2019m not talking about some long\u00a0\u00a0 forgotten ritual from ancient China, I\u2019m talking\u00a0\nabout the sponsor of this video F\u00dcM.

Its\u00a0\nname, literally, means the ruins of Yin. Chinese\u00a0\u00a0 archaeologists excavated several royal tombs at\u00a0\nYinxu between 1928 and 1937, which contained among\u00a0\u00a0 other things the remains of soldiers, horses, and\u00a0\nchariots. These were the remains of troops of the\u00a0\u00a0 Shang Dynasty, the first Chinese dynasty,\u00a0\nwhich is well-documented by written sources\u00a0\u00a0 and archaeological records. Traditional Chinese\u00a0\nhistoriography recognizes an even earlier dynasty,\u00a0\u00a0 the Xia dynasty, but many Western scholars\u00a0\ndoubt its existence because there is no clear\u00a0\u00a0 evidence of a central government during this\u00a0\nperiod, and the first accounts referring to\u00a0\u00a0 it were written some 1,000 years later.\nYin was the last capital of the Shang\u00a0\u00a0 (14th\u201311th centuries), who lived in numerous\u00a0\ncities on the central plains of the Yellow\u00a0\u00a0 River valley. Excavations have shown that Shang\u00a0\nsociety was very complex and heavily stratified.\u00a0\u00a0 At its head was a king who was advised by priests,\u00a0\nwho gave him instructions from the Shang high god\u00a0\u00a0 Di. Just as many Chinese do today, the Shang\u00a0\nalso worshipped their ancestors. According\u00a0\u00a0 to the historian Li Feng, the Shang kings\u00a0\ntraveled around their lands to govern their\u00a0\u00a0 kingdom and established a kind of hegemonic rule\u00a0\nin which most of the authority rested with them\u00a0\u00a0 and was enforced with the help of the army.\nMembers of the upper class lived in houses\u00a0\u00a0 and palaces resembling those of the Forbidden\u00a0\nCity in Beijing, while the common people lived\u00a0\u00a0 in simple pit houses. Most commoners lived in the\u00a0\ncountryside, cultivating wheat and raising sheep,\u00a0\u00a0 goats, and water buffalo. Merchants and\u00a0\nartisans formed a kind of middle class.\u00a0\u00a0 They built the temples of the rich and made\u00a0\ntools, vessels, and weapons, being especially\u00a0\u00a0 known for their skills in bronze working. The\u00a0\nShang needed those weapons for their armies,\u00a0\u00a0 who defended the state against nomadic neighbors\u00a0\nwho sometimes wanted to do more than just trade.\u00a0\u00a0 The army also played an important societal role\u00a0\nbecause it was needed to take captives. The Shang\u00a0\u00a0 demand for prisoners of war was substantial\u00a0\nbecause they used them as human sacrifices.\u00a0 Human sacrifices are documented in various\u00a0\ngraves, as well as in the oldest written\u00a0\u00a0 sources from China: the famous oracle bones. These\u00a0\nwere animal bones used for divination during the\u00a0\u00a0 Shang dynasty. They contain short inscriptions\u00a0\nthat frequently reference battles, fights,\u00a0\u00a0 and sacrifices. One bone, for example,\u00a0\nsays that after a successful campaign,\u00a0\u00a0 \u201c2,656 men were chastised [that is, executed] with\u00a0\nthe halberd.\u201d While this figure is probably not\u00a0\u00a0 to be taken quite literally, archaeologists have\u00a0\nidentified as many as 600 skeletons of sacrificial\u00a0\u00a0 victims in the graves of high-ranking individuals.\nUnfortunately, we do not know much about the Shang\u00a0\u00a0 military. We do know, however, that there was\u00a0\na simple bureaucratic system and that the Shang\u00a0\u00a0 King maintained a standing army of about 1,000\u00a0\nprofessional soldiers, supplemented by levies\u00a0\u00a0 in times of crisis. The conscription system was\u00a0\nbased on clans, which provided 100 men each, led\u00a0\u00a0 by their chiefs. In this way, armies of 3,000 to\u00a0\n5,000 and, in extreme cases, more than 10,000 men,\u00a0\u00a0 could be raised. The finds at Yinxu, along with\u00a0\nother archaeological evidence, hint at how these\u00a0\u00a0 armies were structured. The burials suggest that\u00a0\nthe armies of the Shang consisted of infantry,\u00a0\u00a0 archers, and chariots. The infantry was composed\u00a0\nof regiments of 300 men, each divided into three\u00a0\u00a0 companies: left, right, and center. Ten regiments\u00a0\nformed a larger unit of 3,000 men, also divided\u00a0\u00a0 into three groups. The Shang soldiers were armed\u00a0\nwith halberds, bows, spears, and the so-called Ko,\u00a0\u00a0 or dagger-axes. Probably only the richest\u00a0\ncould afford bronze versions of these weapons.\u00a0 Around the 13th century BC, another piece of\u00a0\narmy equipment was introduced to China from\u00a0\u00a0 the northwest: the chariot. According to Kaushik\u00a0\nRoy, nomads who traveled between the Caucasus and\u00a0\u00a0 the Urals used chariots, and knowledge of the\u00a0\nvehicles was brought to China by prisoners of\u00a0\u00a0 war or traveling merchants. As the discoveries\u00a0\nin Yinxu show, the chariots of the Shang were\u00a0\u00a0 quite complex. Two horses pulled them, they had\u00a0\na single axle with spoked wheels, and they had\u00a0\u00a0 space for an archer, a driver, and often a third\u00a0\nperson armed with a ko and a shield to protect the\u00a0\u00a0 driver. Five such chariots formed a squadron,\u00a0\nand five squadrons formed a chariot company.\u00a0\u00a0 This army provided the Shang with stability and\u00a0\ncontrol for several centuries until a powerful\u00a0\u00a0 contender arose in the 12th and 11th centuries BC.\nChapter 3: The Mandate of Heaven (Western Zhou\u00a0\u00a0 Dynasty, 11th century BC\u2013771 BC.)\nIn the 1059 BC Mercury, Venus,\u00a0\u00a0 Mars Jupiter and Saturn formed a conjunction\u00a0\nvisible to the naked eye and somewhat later\u00a0\u00a0 the comet 1P/Halley passed by earth. The rulers of\u00a0\nZhou interpreted this as a supernatural sign they\u00a0\u00a0 were destined to rule. Not long after\u2014probably in\u00a0\n1046\u2014King Wu of Zhou marched for Yin with an army\u00a0\u00a0 that was supposedly composed of 45,000 men. He\u00a0\nclashed with the Shang defenders at the Battle\u00a0\u00a0 of Muye. This was the culmination of a period\u00a0\nof increasing tensions and rivalries between\u00a0\u00a0 the ruling Shang and the vassal Zhou and ended\u00a0\nin a clear victory for the Zhou, who conquered\u00a0\u00a0 the capital. This ended the Shang dynasty.\nThe fall of the Shang is a central topic in\u00a0\u00a0 one of the earliest written sources of Chinese\u00a0\nhistory, the Book of Documents. It contains\u00a0\u00a0 various battle speeches that justify the attack\u00a0\non the Shang by portraying them as violent and\u00a0\u00a0 corrupt. This coincided with the Zhou\u2019s creation\u00a0\nof a new political ideology called the Mandate of\u00a0\u00a0 Heaven. The Mandate of Heaven shaped China for\u00a0\ncenturies by legitimizing the rule of kings and\u00a0\u00a0 emperors. According to this doctrine, tian\u2014which\u00a0\nliterally means heaven but refers to a superior,\u00a0\u00a0 impersonal deity\u2014gave its mandate to a worthy\u00a0\nfamily, making them the rightful rulers. If\u00a0\u00a0 they proved unworthy, tian revoked the mandate\u00a0\nand allowed a new ruler to overthrow the old\u00a0\u00a0 one. This was what had occurred with the\u00a0\nShang, at least according to the Zhou:\u00a0 [T]he king of Shang, with strength\u00a0\npursues his lawless way. He has cast away\u00a0 the time-worn sires, and cultivates\u00a0\nintimacies with wicked men. Dissolute,\u00a0 intemperate, reckless, oppressive\u00a0\n[\u2026]. The innocent cry to Heaven.\u00a0 In fact, the Zhou and the Shang were not all\u00a0\nthat different. Along with the Xia dynasty,\u00a0\u00a0 if it existed, the Zhou and Shang dynasties grew\u00a0\nout of the Longshan culture. They coexisted in\u00a0\u00a0 three separate areas but replaced each other\u00a0\nas the dominant power. According to John King\u00a0\u00a0 Fairbank and Merle Goldmann, experts on Chinese\u00a0\nhistory, there was \u201ca high degree of cultural\u00a0\u00a0 homogeneity and continuity\u201d between the Shang and\u00a0\nthe Zhou. They even spoke very similar languages.\u00a0 The cultural and political center of the Western\u00a0\nZhou Dynasty, which succeeded the Shang Dynasty,\u00a0\u00a0 was in the Wei River valley, near their capital,\u00a0\nFenghao. Soon after their rise to power,\u00a0\u00a0 the Zhou began to expand their sphere of\u00a0\ninfluence, leading campaigns against the\u00a0\u00a0 nomadic tribes in the northwest and forays\u00a0\ninto the areas adjacent to the Han, Yangtze,\u00a0\u00a0 and Huai rivers. To control their vast territory,\u00a0\nthe Zhou established a new system of government,\u00a0\u00a0 the Fengjian system. As in the Western feudal\u00a0\nsystem, the king would grant land to a nobleman,\u00a0\u00a0 making him lord of that region, in\u00a0\nexchange for a pledge of allegiance.\u00a0 The central pillars of the Zhou's power were\u00a0\nthe ritual authority of the king\u2014now seen as\u00a0\u00a0 God's representative on earth\u2014as well\u00a0\nas a complex bureaucracy and a powerful\u00a0\u00a0 army. According to a standard reference on\u00a0\nmilitary history, World History of Warfare,\u00a0\u00a0 the Zhou army initially differed from that of the\u00a0\nShang only in size\u2014the Zhou were reportedly able\u00a0\u00a0 to mobilize more than 75,000 men. The core of this\u00a0\narmy was still made up of infantry and chariots,\u00a0\u00a0 but the latter were now drawn by four horses and\u00a0\naccompanied by four infantry units, one on each\u00a0\u00a0 side. In addition, drums, bells, and banners were\u00a0\nused to communicate. For example, lowering the\u00a0\u00a0 banners on the commander's chariot was the signal\u00a0\nto retreat. When a Zhou army was on the march, the\u00a0\u00a0 chariots formed a barricade around the camp. This\u00a0\narrangement was comparable to later wagon forts.\u00a0 Exactly how fighting took place is difficult to\u00a0\ndetermine. This is due to the way early Chinese\u00a0\u00a0 literature talks about war. In most cases,\u00a0\nthe actual act of war is omitted. The literary\u00a0\u00a0 scholar Ching Hsien Wang calls this the \u201cellipsis\u00a0\nof battle.\u201d This is perfectly illustrated by the\u00a0\u00a0 poem \u201cThe Sixth Month\u201d from the Book of Songs,\u00a0\nalso known as the Classic of Poetry. Several\u00a0\u00a0 verses are devoted to describing the preparations\u00a0\nfor battle\u2014how people prepare their horses, fill\u00a0\u00a0 the quivers with arrows, bring in the harvest, and\u00a0\nmarch to the battlefield\u2014but when it comes to the\u00a0\u00a0 actual battle, there's but one short sentence: \u201cWe\u00a0\nsmote the Xian-yu / As far as the great plain.\u201d\u00a0 There is, however, an idealistic, strongly\u00a0\nritualistic description of how battles played out.\u00a0\u00a0 According to this description, the commander first\u00a0\nconsulted an oracle. Depending on the result, the\u00a0\u00a0 army broke camp and retreated or took up battle\u00a0\nformation. In the latter case, the officers then\u00a0\u00a0 assembled at the general's tent. The general\u00a0\ngave a battle speech, delivered his orders,\u00a0\u00a0 and asked the gods and ancestors for support. When\u00a0\nthe drums beat for the attack, the army advanced.\u00a0\u00a0 According to the World History of Warfare, tactics\u00a0\nand strategy were less important than leadership,\u00a0\u00a0 momentum, and morale. While an infantry melee\u00a0\nensued in the center, the nobles met on the\u00a0\u00a0 flanks and fought separate fights and challenges\u00a0\non their chariots in combats that often had a\u00a0\u00a0 ritual character. If the Zhou were victorious,\u00a0\nthey would feast on the enemies' supplies and\u00a0\u00a0 sacrifice some prisoners of war as \u201cblood for\u00a0\nthe drums.\u201d Whether the Zhou really followed\u00a0\u00a0 this procedure or instead flexibly adapted the\u00a0\nrules of combat to the situation is hard to say.\u00a0 In the 9th century, the rule of the Western\u00a0\nZhou began to crumble. Military defeats,\u00a0\u00a0 pressure from neighboring nomadic tribes, and the\u00a0\naccumulation of power among important vassals led\u00a0\u00a0 to tensions, revolts and, eventually,\u00a0\nthe end of the Western Zhou dynasty.\u00a0 Chapter 4: Professionalization\u00a0\n(Eastern Zhou Dynasty, 771\u2013256 BC.)\u00a0 \u201cThe supreme art of war is to subdue the enemy\u00a0\nwithout fighting.\u201d These words are taken from one\u00a0\u00a0 of the most famous books on strategy and warfare\u00a0\never, The Art of War by Sun Tzu. This book,\u00a0\u00a0 written in the 5th century BC, is still read\u00a0\nin military academies and business schools,\u00a0\u00a0 and its principles are still applied to conflicts.\u00a0\nThe Art of War, along with other writings on\u00a0\u00a0 military theory from this period, is an expression\u00a0\nof the professionalization of Chinese warfare.\u00a0 The Zhou got off lightly from their crisis and\u00a0\nestablished a new capital in the eastern part\u00a0\u00a0 of their territory, Wangcheng. Thus began\u00a0\nthe Eastern Zhou Dynasty . Nevertheless,\u00a0\u00a0 the Zhou rulers never fully reestablished control\u00a0\nand order. The end of their dominance allowed\u00a0\u00a0 other states to expand their influence, leading\u00a0\nto an ongoing struggle for supremacy. The ensuing\u00a0\u00a0 competition and seemingly endless wars promoted\u00a0\ntechnological progress, intellectual endeavors,\u00a0\u00a0 and the professionalization of warfare. For\u00a0\nexample, this was the time of Confucius,\u00a0\u00a0 the great philosopher who remains very influential\u00a0\nacross China and East Asia to this day.\u00a0 As early as the 6th century BC, the chariot\u00a0\nand the ritualized form of warfare associated\u00a0\u00a0 with it gradually became less important. Chariot\u00a0\ncompanies were replaced by large, disciplined,\u00a0\u00a0 and powerful infantry armies, mainly consisting\u00a0\nof recruits from the peasantry, and by fast, agile\u00a0\u00a0 cavalry. New technologies such as the crossbow,\u00a0\ninvented in the early 5th century BC; catapults;\u00a0\u00a0 and finally, towards the end of the 4th century\u00a0\nBC, mounted archers like those used by the nomads\u00a0\u00a0 of northwestern China, with whom the northern\u00a0\nempires were in constant conflict, further\u00a0\u00a0 changed warfare. These skilled horse warriors gave\u00a0\nthe Chinese troops a hard time, which is why the\u00a0\u00a0 northern states of Qin, Zhao, and Yan began\u00a0\nto fortify parts of their borders with walls.\u00a0\u00a0 These walls were the beginnings of the defensive\u00a0\nline that would become the Great Wall of China.\u00a0 These military and architectural developments\u00a0\nwere made possible by a series of social and\u00a0\u00a0 technological innovations. The warring princes\u00a0\ncontinually chased new ideas and technologies that\u00a0\u00a0 could give them an edge over their competitors.\u00a0\nFor example, the liberation of peasants through\u00a0\u00a0 the abolition of the feudal system meant that\u00a0\nmasses of commoners were now available for\u00a0\u00a0 military service, the development of irrigation\u00a0\nsystems improved harvests, and the extraction and\u00a0\u00a0 processing of iron allowed for better tools\u00a0\nand weapons. Thanks to these innovations,\u00a0\u00a0 armies became bigger and better. In the third\u00a0\ncentury BC, some armies may have numbered as\u00a0\u00a0 many as 400,000 men. Although numbers such as\u00a0\nthese should be taken with a grain of salt,\u00a0\u00a0 they show the tremendous progress the armies of\u00a0\nChina and the states producing them had made.\u00a0 During the Warring States period, the\u00a0\nmore powerful empires conquered more and\u00a0\u00a0 more of the smaller ones until only seven states\u00a0\nremained. After centuries of struggling for power,\u00a0\u00a0 one of those warring states, the Qin, gained the\u00a0\nupper hand. Although the others forged alliances\u00a0\u00a0 against him, Zheng, the king of Qin, eventually\u00a0\nsubdued one state after another. By 221 BC,\u00a0\u00a0 he had conquered all of China. He became the first\u00a0\nemperor of China under the name Qin Shi Huang.\u00a0 Epilogue\nIn 1974, farmers near Xi\u2019an in central China\u00a0\u00a0 dug a well near Qin Shi Huang's burial mound.\u00a0\nUnexpectedly, they found ancient clay shards,\u00a0\u00a0 bricks, and bronze arrowheads. The news of this\u00a0\nfind spread quickly. Archaeologists began to\u00a0\u00a0 examine the site more closely and discovered the\u00a0\nlegendary terracotta army. It is no coincidence\u00a0\u00a0 that Qin Shi Huang made it part of his mausoleum.\u00a0\nNot only had he united his empire in war, but he\u00a0\u00a0 had also changed the intellectual attitude toward\u00a0\nwar and made the self-portrayal as a warrior\u00a0\u00a0 a distinguishing feature of his dynasty.\nDuring the period of stability his rule brought,\u00a0\u00a0 Qin Shi Huang created the foundations of the\u00a0\nChinese state system. He reformed the army,\u00a0\u00a0 expanded military infrastructures, and centralized\u00a0\nthe administration and bureaucracy. Among his most\u00a0\u00a0 important reforms were the abolition of serfdom,\u00a0\nthe standardization of weights and measures,\u00a0\u00a0 and the harmonization of Chinese writing.\u00a0\nPerhaps his most famous legacy, though,\u00a0\u00a0 was the expansion of the individual sections\u00a0\nof the wall in northern China into a continuous\u00a0\u00a0 line of defense: the Great Wall of China. This\u00a0\nmassive defensive line served the empire well for\u00a0\u00a0 centuries. But it is none of these achievements\u00a0\nthat shape our memory of China's first emperor\u00a0\u00a0 but rather the actions he took towards the end\u00a0\nof his life. Qin Shi Huang became paranoid, had\u00a0\u00a0 books burned and scholars executed, and searched\u00a0\nobstinately for the elixir of life. His search\u00a0\u00a0 was unsuccessful. The first emperor of China died\u00a0\nin 210 BC, and his empire plunged into turmoil. "
