"[Music] thank you [Music] video number 107 from mytho religious series book 4. dragons are dinosaurs part two in Sumerian Chinese and Thai artifacts dear fellow true seekers in the last few videos I have shared information about several ancient artifacts that seem to prove that civilized humans have existed much much longer than what historians have been telling us according to the theory of evolution modern human I.E homo sapiens heard in Africa thousand are a maximum three hundred thousand years ago and yet we actually found man-made artifacts that are already millions and even billions years old but they have been ignored by mainstream academics because they do not fit with the conventional historical timeline if all the previous information that I have shared with you in the previous videos is still not enough to come to the conclusion that civilized human beings have been living on our planet much longer than nearly circus 6 000 years ago probably millions or even billions years ago let's have a look at following evidence in artifacts and literatures concerning dragons or dinosaurs almost all if not all nations in the world have stories about dragons today we consider dragons or giant serpents or gigantic reptilians as legendary mythical creatures in other words they never really existed but is it so isn't it odd that so many nations in the world have stories about dragons if they never really existed they must have been invented by the imaginations of our ancestors how did our ancestors from different parts of the World Imagine the same creature or did they actually see the same real living creature shockingly there's plenty of evidence that men and dinosaurs actually interacted the evidence is recorded in form of art literature and artifacts this plethora of artifacts proved men and dinosaurs coexisted how else do we explain the representation in art literature or artifacts of recognizable species of dinosaurs by ancient men who supposedly had never seen one alive in the previous video number 106 I have shared the origin of the name dinosaur and how a real scientist by the name of Robert calledaway 1855-1925 a German architect and practicing archaeologist was suspicious that what we call dinosaurs today might be the one and same mythical creature known as dragons beginning with the rediscovery of ancient Babylon located in modern Iraq today [Music] he suggested that the series at the Gate of Ishtar probably was a depiction of a species of dinosaur called iguanodum today but as you can see they do not really look alike however since he proposed his theory many other authors especially among Christian creationists today continue this Dragon dinosaur research in order to prove the validity of the Bible which contains several stories concerning dragons and amazingly there is much evidence proving cold away have been right all along so some Christian researchers have proposed that the Cirrus at the Gate of Ishtar might be the same species of dinosaur called muscle spondylus instead of Iguanodon and surprisingly this creature has also been depicted with precise detail by the Chinese during the Tang Dynasty in the previous video I have also shown a bizarre decoration on the helmet of the traditions an ancient group of Indo-European tribe who inhabited South Eastern Europe that looks like a species of dinosaur called centosaurus a duck-built dinosaur with a unicorn [Music] Dragon dinosaur artifacts part 2. if you're still not convinced allow me to show more bizarre statues and pictures from the ancient and not so ancient worlds that coincidentally look very similar to what we call dinosaurs today however we must remember that there are so many different types of dinosaurs dinosaurs are a varied group of animals some were bipedal or two-legged some quadrupedal four-legged some were human-sized or even smaller some very large some were terrestrials some semi-aquatic and some could even fly or at least light and we have found dinosaur fossils in every continent in the world including Antarctica [Music] if you still doubt that the Cyrus of the e-star gate could not have been the same as what we call dinosaur today what do you think of the following depiction could this creature with Serpentine looking head big body with long tail and neck found in ancient Sumerian tablet be the same as what we call Apatosaurus or brontosaurus and yet brontosaurus is supposed to be extinct Circa 150 million years ago if not what are they then surely these aren't elephants the following art piece pictured on the left is from China around 1400 CE it is currently in the Genesis Park collection it displays numerous characteristics of the big dinosaur feed configuration three toes metatarsal stunts scale-like representation all over the body except for the horn which has a striated pattern long alpad slander tail elaborate head Crest and a long neck [Music] to the right is what looks like a characterization of a very similar animal this piece is an antique also from China the gallery identifies the piece as a bird a four-legged bird no doubt because of the dark bill this piece seems to represent a similar animal as the first piece on the left did it appears that the artist had some familiarity with duck-built Dinosaurs is it a coincidence that the fossils of brachiosophers the type of duckbilled dinosaur have been found in China this is how it might have looked like the following photos portray this animal as deduced from its skull is a quad from China do they look like here is another fascinating Chinese artifact from the late Eastern Zoo sauropod fungian ornamental box reference phone went at the great Bronze Age of China Metropolitan Museum of Art 1980 page 285. the creature on that box has a long neck and a head that resembles a brachial sword the difference is it displayed a tritical foot three forward-facing toes like on birds traductal foot is not uncommon though among dinosaurs although so far as our paleontological research goes typically it is common among the carnivorous theropods and not among the hair before sauropods here is a comparison of Gian Fang's animal head with another sauropod head and neck detail and here is a comparison of it with a sauropod Brachiosaurus they are eerily similar looking don't you think [Music] if it isn't depicting a dinosaur what animal did the artist try to depict and if it is simply a fantasy creature then how remarkably similar it is to a real dinosaur next let's consider a Shang Dynasty 1766 until 1122 BCE Dragon artifact that was advertised on the Chinese Antiquities Market as a dinosaur depiction it displays relief lines in a scale-like pattern a broad beak a dermal frill and a head Crest that strikingly looks like the dinosaur sarolithus shells on the right this Jade statue now in the Genesis part collection is made of white colored nephrites with differential weathering cleaving veins and Earth penetration demonstrating its authenticity if this artifact is in depicting subtle of this then what is it there is no other animal in existence today that looks like this animal and again if it is Pure Fantasy animal then how remarkable that it looks so similar to several office don't you think here's another one an ancient tie incense burner from the book of Asia next to it is a statue of a giant sauropod dinosaur Park in Thailand near where the bones of a sauropod were found in 1976. sauropods had very long necks long tails small heads relative to the rest of their body and four thick pillar-like legs they are notable for the enormous sizes attained by some species and the group includes the largest animals to have ever lived on land [Music] the longest dinosaur known from reasonable fossils material is probably Argentinosaurus who in glenses with length estimates of 35 meters or 115 feet to 36 meters or 118 feet according to the most recent researches fossilized remains of sauropods have been found on every continent including Antarctica and Asia including in Thailand now is it a coincidence how the animal Declaration of this Thai incense burner looks so similar to sauropod type of dinosaur that was actually found in Thailand and again if this incense burner is not depicting sauropod what kind of animal is it depicting them but sauropods may have extinct between 90 to 75 million years ago so when did the ties learn about this creature deer fellow through Seekers there are still many more proof that dragons are the same as dinosaurs and I will share more of them in the next video [Music] for now I thank you for watching and hope to see you on my next video [Music] thank you [Music] foreign [Music] "
