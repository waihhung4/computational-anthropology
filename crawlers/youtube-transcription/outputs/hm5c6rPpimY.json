"ancient legends myths and religions from around\u00a0\nthe world have spoken of gods and Angels not\u00a0\u00a0 always in the spiritual sense but actual Flesh\u00a0\nand Blood beings interacting with mankind many\u00a0\u00a0 of these ancient cultures had vast knowledge\u00a0\nof mathematics and astronomy attributing their\u00a0\u00a0 knowledge as being hanged down from the gods\u00a0\nwho were these god-like beings known to one\u00a0\u00a0 of the oldest civilizations the Sumerians as the\u00a0\nAnunnaki we'll explore the Mysteries around the\u00a0\u00a0 Anunnaki and search for hidden answers in\u00a0\nthe new episode of secret Origins welcome the Sumerian civilization which emerged\u00a0\nmore than 6 000 years ago from the Stone\u00a0\u00a0 Age is credited with over a hundred of\u00a0\nthe earliest advancements for a modern\u00a0\u00a0 society these include agriculture science\u00a0\nmedicine mathematics kingship laws courts\u00a0\u00a0 judges calls and essentially all aspects of\u00a0\nsociety that were integral to its development\u00a0\u00a0 but how did a civilization like this\u00a0\nbecome so Advanced out of nowhere is\u00a0\u00a0 it possible that they were held by another\u00a0\nmore advanced extraterrestrial civilization\u00a0\u00a0 in recent times Swan theory has been tremendously\u00a0\ngaining popularity the one about the ancient\u00a0\u00a0 astronauts and the beings called the Anunnaki\u00a0\nwho were they did they truly exist and if so what\u00a0\u00a0 was their purpose and the motivation for creating\u00a0\nHumanity thought to be the oldest civilization in\u00a0\u00a0 the world the southern Mesopotamian civilization\u00a0\nof ancient Sumeria emerged around three thousand\u00a0\u00a0 four thousand BC they left behind valuable\u00a0\nevidence of their Advanced Society including\u00a0\u00a0 riding on cuneiform tablets made of clay and\u00a0\nstone which they invented using a wedge-shaped\u00a0\u00a0 stylist to impress symbols onto wet clay tablets\u00a0\ntheir writing system allowed for information\u00a0\u00a0 to be preserved for a long time deciphering the\u00a0\ncuneiform tablets proved difficult in March 1843\u00a0\u00a0 however thousands of tablets were uncovered at an\u00a0\nazerian Palace providing crucial evidence of an\u00a0\u00a0 ancient Kingdom within a decade the ruins of the\u00a0\nSumerian capital city of York were also discovered\u00a0\u00a0 here researchers found the cigarette of fewer\u00a0\ncuneiform tablets and gold adorned tombs but what\u00a0\u00a0 is interesting is that the cuneiform tablets found\u00a0\nat the site reveal more than just evidence of an\u00a0\u00a0 ancient civilization they point to descriptions of\u00a0\na group of divine beings known as the Anunnaki or\u00a0\u00a0 The princely Offspring of God who according\u00a0\nto Sumerian belief descended from the sky Sumerian civilization believed in hierarchy\u00a0\nof gods called the Anunnaki which the Heavenly\u00a0\u00a0 Gods being the Supreme deities these beings\u00a0\npossessed immense knowledge and power beyond\u00a0\u00a0 human capacity and their origin remains a mystery\u00a0\nto archaeologists the Sumerian Tablets suggests\u00a0\u00a0 the possibility of extraterrestrial origin\u00a0\nfor the Anunnaki who played a significant\u00a0\u00a0 role in the civilizations development that they\u00a0\nwere responsible for genetically engineering\u00a0\u00a0 the human race as seen in the Sumerian king list\u00a0\ncontaining names of Kings who lived for hundreds\u00a0\u00a0 of years leading researchers to speculate\u00a0\nabout the presence of extraterrestrial genes\u00a0\u00a0 the Sumerian king list is perhaps one of the\u00a0\nmost important ancient texts that perfectly\u00a0\u00a0 describes a time in history where literally\u00a0\nGods ruled for thousands of years after the\u00a0\u00a0 kingship descended from Heaven the kingship\u00a0\nwas in eridu in arida alilim became king\u00a0\u00a0 he ruled for 28 800 years a loud jar ruled\u00a0\nfor 36 000 years they rode for 64 800 years\u00a0\u00a0 one of the most interesting details about the\u00a0\nSumerian king list is the fact that the earliest\u00a0\u00a0 list describes eight Kings who ruled over Earth\u00a0\nfor a total of 241 200 years since the original\u00a0\u00a0 kingship had descended from Heaven all the way to\u00a0\nthe time of the great flood which swept over the\u00a0\u00a0 land and once more the kingship was lowered from\u00a0\nHeaven After the flood could the ancient Kings of\u00a0\u00a0 Summer have lived for hundreds or even thousands\u00a0\nof years making them are extraterrestrial\u00a0\u00a0 ancestors some believe this question was\u00a0\nanswered over 35 years ago in 1976 zecharia\u00a0\u00a0 sitchin published the book the 12th Planet\u00a0\nrevealing his interpretation of the Anunnaki\u00a0\u00a0 deities sichem believed that the Sumerian gods\u00a0\nwere extraterrestrial who landed on Earth over 450\u00a0\u00a0 000 years ago created humans and played a role\u00a0\nin their downfall during during a great flood\u00a0\u00a0 but why did the Anunnaki visit Earth and create\u00a0\nhumans according to sichin's hypothesis they came\u00a0\u00a0 to Earth to mine gold and created humans to\u00a0\nperform the task this theory is controversial\u00a0\u00a0 but provides evidence that the Anunnaki were\u00a0\nthe original creators of mankind the Anunnaki\u00a0\u00a0 claimed to have come from their planet Nibiru\u00a0\nand could travel through Stargates and wormholes\u00a0\u00a0 Zakaria sitchin also claimed that the Sumerians\u00a0\nlearned astrology from the Anunnaki which gave\u00a0\u00a0 them a deep understanding of our solar system\u00a0\nincluding Venus and Saturn and even depicted\u00a0\u00a0 a tenth planet called Nibiru sichin believed\u00a0\nthat Nibiru orbits the Sun every 3600 Earth\u00a0\u00a0 years and causes disruptions when it passes\u00a0\nclose to Earth in 1983 The Washington Post\u00a0\u00a0 reported a Heavenly Body as large as Jupiter\u00a0\nand NASA had acknowledged the possibility of\u00a0\u00a0 a large Hidden Planet due to gravitational\u00a0\neffects observed in our solar system modern\u00a0\u00a0 astronomers have detected a 10th Planet larger\u00a0\nthan Pluto some believe that the Anunnaki came\u00a0\u00a0 from Nibiru and created a shield on Earth\u00a0\nusing gold to help heal their own planet\u00a0\u00a0 so who exactly were the Anunnaki the term\u00a0\nAnunnaki comes from Anno the chief god of\u00a0\u00a0 the sky and Anunnaki simply means the children\u00a0\nof anno or it can be also translated as those\u00a0\u00a0 who came from the sky the three most prominent\u00a0\nfigures in the Anunnaki Pantheon are ano and his\u00a0\u00a0 two sons the half brothers and Lil and enki Anu\u00a0\nwas the supreme god and ruler of the Anunnaki\u00a0\u00a0 and was believed to reside in Heavens overseeing\u00a0\nthe actions of the other gods elil was the god of\u00a0\u00a0 the air and storm he was the firstborn son of Anu\u00a0\nand his rightful Heir so his role on Earth was as\u00a0\u00a0 the enforcer of his father's will in a way he was\u00a0\nthe main ruler of the planet enki was the Second\u00a0\u00a0 Son of Anu he was the god of knowledge wisdom and\u00a0\ncreation originally enki was worshiped as a god\u00a0\u00a0 of fresh water and served as the patreon deity of\u00a0\nthe city of eridu today eridu is often considered\u00a0\u00a0 to be one of the oldest permanent settlements\u00a0\nin Mesopotamia and perhaps even in the world\u00a0\u00a0 the ancient Sumerians also believed that eridu was\u00a0\nthe first city in the world and they documented\u00a0\u00a0 that belief in the Sumerian king list and the\u00a0\neredu Genesis at the current times at least 18\u00a0\u00a0 layers of settlement have been found at the\u00a0\nsite so chances are it really was the first\u00a0\u00a0 city and probably the residents of Prince enki\u00a0\nOver time however enki's influence grew and this\u00a0\u00a0 deity was considered to have power over many\u00a0\nother aspects of life including trickery and\u00a0\u00a0 Mischief magic creation and fertility in\u00a0\nfact it was enki together with ninhurzak\u00a0\u00a0 the ancient symbol of the powerful mother who\u00a0\ngenetically engineered the first humans called\u00a0\u00a0 Adamo they did it by mixing their one DNA with\u00a0\nthat of homo erectus and as a result created the\u00a0\u00a0 homo sapiens it so reminds us of the biblical\u00a0\nphrase that God created us in his own image initially the humans were not able to reproduce\u00a0\nthey were created in Laboratories and were used\u00a0\u00a0 as Workforce to mine gold seeing how his\u00a0\nCreations his own children in a way were\u00a0\u00a0 being exploited henki decided to take care\u00a0\nof them by going against and Lil's will enki\u00a0\u00a0 secretly gave humans the knowledge of mating and\u00a0\nreproducing and not only he had been teaching them\u00a0\u00a0 the knowledge of the universe some theories\u00a0\nproposed that one of enki's favorite places\u00a0\u00a0 to resign was Atlantis then that in trying\u00a0\nto protect his children he with the aid of\u00a0\u00a0 arcturians established the Atlantean civilization\u00a0\nan isolated place where humans could live freely\u00a0\u00a0 without being exploited by the Annunaki but this\u00a0\nact enraged and Lil in fact the Sumerian clay\u00a0\u00a0 tablet described a war between the two brothers it\u00a0\ncomes out that the detonation of nuclear weapons\u00a0\u00a0 in the 20th century was not the first time\u00a0\nhumanity had seen such a terrible destruction\u00a0\u00a0 drawing upon the work of zecharia sitchin the Book\u00a0\nof Genesis Sumerian clay tablets in archaeological\u00a0\u00a0 evidence such as an ancient radioactive skeletons\u00a0\nthere is a possibility of an ancient nuclear event\u00a0\u00a0 that destroyed the Sumerian civilization\u00a0\nas a result of power struggles of the Gods\u00a0\u00a0 as his creator the Anunnaki God enki had a\u00a0\nfatherly relationship with the first humans\u00a0\u00a0 but in Lil who was acting as a sole commander of\u00a0\nEarth was enraged at his brother enki for spoiling\u00a0\u00a0 the Anunnaki Bloodlines through interbreeding\u00a0\nthis shift imposed a blackout not only of the\u00a0\u00a0 very human nature of the Anunnaki Gods but\u00a0\nalso of Humanity's own ancient past on Earth\u00a0\u00a0 there is a theory suggesting that two of\u00a0\nand Lil's attacks against the enki clan\u00a0\u00a0 and Humanity are described in the stories of\u00a0\nthe Deluge and the Tower of Babel his final\u00a0\u00a0 attempt after coursing the assembly of the Gods\u00a0\nin devoting yes was the nuclear bombing of five\u00a0\u00a0 cities of the Jordan plain including sudom and\u00a0\nGomorrah which resulted in the destruction of\u00a0\u00a0 the Sumerian civilization and the anunnaki's own\u00a0\ncivilization on Earth including their Spaceport\u00a0\u00a0 in the Sinai the Terra papers tells that after\u00a0\nthe war enki was exiled from the planet however\u00a0\u00a0 he still continued to teach Humanity spiritual\u00a0\nknowledge and to Aid them in their development\u00a0\u00a0 the Anunnaki were known in ancient Babylon\u00a0\nas sire which carries the meaning of dragons\u00a0\u00a0 or big serpents and the Anunnaki God enki was\u00a0\nassociated with the Brotherhood of the snake\u00a0\u00a0 and was often represented by two coiled snakes\u00a0\nof caduceus a symbol that had multiple meanings\u00a0\u00a0 in ancient times some Scholars have suggested\u00a0\nthat the symbol represented The Reptilian nature\u00a0\u00a0 of the Anunnaki and their alleged connection\u00a0\nto a reptilian alien race While others have\u00a0\u00a0 linked to the coiled serpent as a symbol of\u00a0\nKundalini of spiritual knowledge and wisdom\u00a0\u00a0 interestingly the caduceus is also the magic\u00a0\nwand carried by Hermes also known as thought\u00a0\u00a0 the Egyptian god of wisdom and not only the\u00a0\ncaduceus of enki and later on Hermes features\u00a0\u00a0 at the top of the central Rod the pine cone that\u00a0\nrepresents the gift of Kundalini awareness when\u00a0\u00a0 activated often when the caduceus is winged\u00a0\nmeaning that in our deepest meditations we\u00a0\u00a0 can fly and access all knowledge and tools\u00a0\nfor healing another enigmatic object seen\u00a0\u00a0 in the Sumerian art is the bracelet that\u00a0\nmost of the major Anunnaki gods wear the\u00a0\u00a0 meaning of these bracelets is unknown but\u00a0\nsome believe that they were not randomly\u00a0\u00a0 depicted and there has to be a deeper symbolic\u00a0\nmeaning they remind us a little bit of watches\u00a0\u00a0 but the most intriguing object that the Anunnaki\u00a0\nhole is a pine cone which is always directed\u00a0\u00a0 towards something do we know anything about the\u00a0\npine cones in ancient Mesopotamia what were they\u00a0\u00a0 believed to represent or symbolize in ancient\u00a0\ntimes from esoteric perspective the fine cone can\u00a0\u00a0 be seen as a symbol of spiritual enlightenment\u00a0\nand Awakening the Divine cone is a symbol that\u00a0\u00a0 has been used in many cultures and religions\u00a0\nthroughout history including ancient Sumerian\u00a0\u00a0 Egyptian and Greek cultures the pine cone was\u00a0\nsometimes used as a sacred offering or as a\u00a0\u00a0 symbol of the Divine for example in ancient Egypt\u00a0\nthe staff of Osiris the god of the afterlife was\u00a0\u00a0 depicted with a fine cone at the top in Hinduism\u00a0\nthe fine cone is sometimes associated with Lord\u00a0\u00a0 Shiva the God of destruction and transformation\u00a0\nthe Pope's stuff also known as the papal ferula\u00a0\u00a0 features a pine cone as a decorative element in\u00a0\nVatican Square there is a bronze sculpture of\u00a0\u00a0 a pine cone that is known as the largest in the\u00a0\nworld it is located in the courtyard of the pine\u00a0\u00a0 cone and is considered a significant symbol of\u00a0\nthe Vatican spiritual and historical significance\u00a0\u00a0 why in some esoteric Traditions the fine cone is\u00a0\nalso seen as a symbol of regeneration and rebirth\u00a0\u00a0 this is because the pine cone contains seeds\u00a0\nthat can be used to grow new trees symbolizing\u00a0\u00a0 the cycle of Life Death and rebirth kyonifar pine\u00a0\ntrees are one of the oldest planned Genera on the\u00a0\u00a0 planet having existed much longer than all\u00a0\nflowering plants species combined pine cones\u00a0\u00a0 The evolutionary precursor to flowers have spines\u00a0\nthat spiral in perfect Fibonacci Sequence similar\u00a0\u00a0 to the sacred geometry of a rose or a sunflower\u00a0\nin most of the ancient cultures the pine cone\u00a0\u00a0 was associated with the pineal gland likely due to\u00a0\nthe pineal glands Pine cone-like shape the pineal\u00a0\u00a0 gland named after a shape like a pine cone is\u00a0\nlocated at the geometric center of our brain and\u00a0\u00a0 is closely linked to our perception of light it is\u00a0\na small endocrine gland responsible for producing\u00a0\u00a0 secreting melatonin which regulates sleep wake\u00a0\npatterns and circadian rhythms receives more\u00a0\u00a0 blood flow than than any other area of the body\u00a0\nexcept the kidneys and is uniquely isolated from\u00a0\u00a0 the blood-brain barrier system the pineal gland\u00a0\nis also associated with spiritual and mystical\u00a0\u00a0 experiences and has been referred to as a third\u00a0\neye in some spiritual Traditions or the seed of\u00a0\u00a0 the Soul it is said to be the gateway to higher\u00a0\nstate of consciousness and spiritual experiences\u00a0\u00a0 Rick Strassman a psychopharmacologist believes\u00a0\nthat the third eye is the source to psychedelic\u00a0\u00a0 DMT in our bodies Strassman has hypothesized\u00a0\nthat large amounts of DMT are released in our\u00a0\u00a0 bodies during heightened states of spiritual\u00a0\nconsciousness such as birth death and near-dead\u00a0\u00a0 experiences or perhaps during The Awakening\u00a0\nof our Kundalini in a moment of enlightenment\u00a0\u00a0 synthesized DMT or plants containing DMT are often\u00a0\nused as a recreational psychedelics or in shamanic\u00a0\u00a0 ceremonies such as the ayahuasca ceremony\u00a0\noriginating in South America DMT users often\u00a0\u00a0 report intense experiences of Spiritual Awakening\u00a0\ncontact with entities of Supernatural or spiritual\u00a0\u00a0 origin and the dilation or compression of time and\u00a0\nwhat is interesting is that the among the reports\u00a0\u00a0 of thousands users experiencing with Ayahuasca\u00a0\nthe serpent is documented as the most commonly\u00a0\u00a0 appearing archetype in their spiritual visions the\u00a0\npine cone is a special symbol because the spiral\u00a0\u00a0 pattern found in pine cones is known to contain\u00a0\nthe Golden Ratio or also known as the Divine\u00a0\u00a0 proportion the golden ratio is a mathematical\u00a0\nproportion that is found throughout nature and is\u00a0\u00a0 associated with beauty Harmony and balance in case\u00a0\nof the pine cone the spiral pattern is created\u00a0\u00a0 by a series of spirals that curve in opposite\u00a0\ndirections forming a distinctive pattern that\u00a0\u00a0 closely follows the golden ratio the golden ratio\u00a0\nis part of the sacred geometry which is often seen\u00a0\u00a0 as a way of revealing the blueprint of creation\u00a0\nas it is believed to tap into the fundamental\u00a0\u00a0 principles and patterns that underlie the universe\u00a0\nso now it is even more evident that the pine cone\u00a0\u00a0 that the Anunnaki were holding was not there by\u00a0\nchance but in fact it symbolizes sacred knowledge\u00a0\u00a0 the blueprint of creation of the whole universe\u00a0\nand carries the message of Spiritual Awakening and\u00a0\u00a0 Enlightenment that can be achieved through the\u00a0\nactivation of the pineal gland and so it comes\u00a0\u00a0 out that the Anunnaki not only created humans as\u00a0\nslaves they also played a role in the evolution\u00a0\u00a0 of human consciousness helping humans to access\u00a0\nand cultivate their spiritual potential by their\u00a0\u00a0 genes with that of homo erectus they also encoded\u00a0\nin our DNA sacred knowledge of the universe and of\u00a0\u00a0 the source of everything knowledge that throughout\u00a0\nhistory we have deeply forgotten but it is still\u00a0\u00a0 there planted somewhere in our DNA and we still\u00a0\nhave the ability to remember it and activate it\u00a0\u00a0 other intriguing traits associated with the\u00a0\nAnunnaki include the mysterious bag depicted\u00a0\u00a0 in ancient artwork which some researchers believe\u00a0\nwas a container for the Water of Life a substance\u00a0\u00a0 used in the anunnaki's genetic experiments\u00a0\non humans and animals or what if they were\u00a0\u00a0 carrying the seeds inside them the bags held\u00a0\nby the Annunaki in ancient Mesopotamian art\u00a0\u00a0 could have represented a variety of different\u00a0\nthings one interpretation is that the bags may\u00a0\u00a0 have represented the anunnaki's role as\u00a0\nkeepers of the secrets or keepers of the\u00a0\u00a0 knowledge in this interpretation The Backs could\u00a0\nbe seen as containers for advanced knowledge and\u00a0\u00a0 Technology representing the anunnaki's role as\u00a0\nthe Guardians and Protectors of ancient wisdom\u00a0\u00a0 elsewhere the hang bag image shows up with\u00a0\nstriking similarities in two Stone reliefs one\u00a0\u00a0 made by the Assyrian of ancient Iraq sometime\u00a0\nbetween 880 859 BC and the other made by the\u00a0\u00a0 olmecs of ancient mesoamerica sometime between\u00a0\n12 400 BC in both of these images a man-like\u00a0\u00a0 figure carries the handbag in his hand as\u00a0\nif it were a basket or purse when used in\u00a0\u00a0 Assyrian art it is said the purse holds a magic\u00a0\ndust probably symbolizing the fertilization of\u00a0\u00a0 Earth by the Anunnaki after all they were\u00a0\nbelieved to be the creators of our planet\u00a0\u00a0 in contemporary times the Annunaki are\u00a0\noften depicted as the equivalent of the\u00a0\u00a0 Creator God in the Old Testament but could there\u00a0\nbe evidence of the anunnaki's existence in ancient\u00a0\u00a0 texts such as the Bible and archaeological\u00a0\ndiscoveries and how will we know for certain\u00a0\u00a0 there are various mentions of extraterrestrial\u00a0\nEncounters in the Bible including descriptions\u00a0\u00a0 of vehicles such as clouds pillars and\u00a0\ndwellings and references to UFOs as flying\u00a0\u00a0 furnace and burning bushes the Book of Genesis\u00a0\nalso mentions the sons of God having Offspring\u00a0\u00a0 with human females resulting in hybrid beings\u00a0\nknown as the Nephilim they are described as\u00a0\u00a0 possessing a cloak or garment that gave them\u00a0\nPowers similar to those of the Anunnaki of Sumeria\u00a0\u00a0 ancient texts such as the ones zecharia sitchin\u00a0\nwas deciphering implied that the Anunnaki owned\u00a0\u00a0 the Garden of Eden so it turns out that the\u00a0\nserpent was a member of the Anunnaki not just\u00a0\u00a0 a Biblical creature it is speculated that it\u00a0\nwas indeed enki himself who transformed into\u00a0\u00a0 a serpent to give the knowledge of mating to his\u00a0\nchildren Adamo and it seems logical since enki\u00a0\u00a0 has always been associated with the symbol of\u00a0\nthe serpent The Book of Ezekiel also describes\u00a0\u00a0 possible extraterrestrial encounters Ezekiel is\u00a0\na major prophet in the Old Testament of the Bible\u00a0\u00a0 he was a priest who was living in Exile in the\u00a0\ncity of Babylon according to the Bible Ezekiel\u00a0\u00a0 was chosen by God to receive visions and messages\u00a0\nwhich he then delivered to the people of Israel\u00a0\u00a0 to guide them and warn them of coming judgment\u00a0\nezekiel's prophecies are recorded in the Book of\u00a0\u00a0 Ezekiel which is one of the books of the Hebrew\u00a0\nBible and the Christian Old Testament according\u00a0\u00a0 to ezekiel's book he had a vision of being with\u00a0\nwings that moved and made tremendous noise in a\u00a0\u00a0 wheel that moved without making a steering\u00a0\nmovement at first Ezekiel thought that what\u00a0\u00a0 he saw was God and he fell on the ground to pray\u00a0\nhowever he later realized that it was not God and\u00a0\u00a0 described what he saw these descriptions bear a\u00a0\nstriking resemblance to what modern UFO sightings\u00a0\u00a0 look like some researchers have speculated that\u00a0\nbeing with wings could be a representation of\u00a0\u00a0 extraterrestrial spacecraft and the wheel could\u00a0\nbe a depiction of a type of propulsion system\u00a0\u00a0 that aliens might use interestingly the original\u00a0\nHebrew text of Ezekiel does not mention the word\u00a0\u00a0 God but instead refers to the Splendor of the\u00a0\nhighest in the Book of Ezekiel the Splendor\u00a0\u00a0 of the highest arrives a second time closing\u00a0\nis equal to feel the gravity and gives him a\u00a0\u00a0 measuring device to measure a building so so can\u00a0\nezekiel's descriptions be interpreted as evidence\u00a0\u00a0 of contact with extraterrestrial beings in ancient\u00a0\ntimes what if it was the same as the Anunnaki\u00a0\u00a0 so far we've seen that it's a fact that there is\u00a0\na widespread belief that the Anunnaki were alien\u00a0\u00a0 entities who played a significant role in shaping\u00a0\nhuman history however is there any proof to answer\u00a0\u00a0 this we'll go back 20 years the location is Iraq\u00a0\nduring operation Iraq Freedom American troops\u00a0\u00a0 were deployed to maintain Ordon in Baghdad however\u00a0\nlooters took advantage of the chaos and destroyed\u00a0\u00a0 numerous ancient artifacts including musical\u00a0\ninstruments and cuneiform tablets It is believed\u00a0\u00a0 that the cuneiform tablets that were stolen from\u00a0\nIraq museums during the chaos of the war in 2003\u00a0\u00a0 contained crucial information about the Anunnaki\u00a0\nand their connection to extraterrestrial beings\u00a0\u00a0 the coordinated and organized nature of the theft\u00a0\nwith individuals using earpieces to gain access\u00a0\u00a0 to double locked doors and steal valuable items\u00a0\nsuggests that this was not a random act of War so\u00a0\u00a0 the question is was this a deliberate attempt to\u00a0\nconceal Forbidden Knowledge from the past what if\u00a0\u00a0 the stolen texts contain significant information\u00a0\nthat supports the theory of an Annunaki connection\u00a0\u00a0 and the involvement of extraterrestrial beings\u00a0\nin shaping human history millions of people\u00a0\u00a0 worldwide are interested in the possibility that\u00a0\nextraterrestrial beings have played a significant\u00a0\u00a0 role in human history the theft of the Priceless\u00a0\nartifact from the national museum in Baghdad\u00a0\u00a0 highlights the importance of preserving and\u00a0\nstudying the past to gain a better understanding\u00a0\u00a0 of our Origins and the potential involvement of\u00a0\nextraterrestrial beings in shaping our destiny and\u00a0\u00a0 if we think about that imagine how much historical\u00a0\naccounts have been reshaped and Rewritten so that\u00a0\u00a0 the real history remains hidden and what we know\u00a0\ntoday is nothing but a tiny part of the truth the\u00a0\u00a0 falsification of his history has done more to\u00a0\nimpede human development than any other thing\u00a0\u00a0 known to mankind how or our view of History\u00a0\nchange if we confirm the anunnaki's role in\u00a0\u00a0 shaping human civilization will we need to rewrite\u00a0\nour history books and if so how would that affect\u00a0\u00a0 our understanding of ourselves and our place in\u00a0\nthe world not only the fact that we are not alone\u00a0\u00a0 but also that we carry a sacred Divine knowledge\u00a0\nwithin our DNA we bow before you and thank you\u00a0\u00a0 for watching another episode of secret Origins\u00a0\nkeep your minds open and until we meet again "
