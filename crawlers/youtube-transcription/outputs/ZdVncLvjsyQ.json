"the ancient sumerians were an ancient civilization who presented monumental and innovative ideas that we still use apply and study today without the advancements of the sumerians our world would look very different from how we know it some people refer to the sumerians as the creators of civilization as modern humans understand it based in mesopotamia the sumerians lived between the tigris and euphrates rivers it was here that their great leaps in languages governing and architecture forever changed human history sumer is the earliest civilization we were able to tie to mesopotamia a region full of historical promise the sumerians were around between the chalcolithic and early bronze ages meaning they were making such fantastic accomplishments from just 4500 to 1900 bc so today here at unexplained mysteries we will be taking a look into the sumerian beliefs to truly see how advanced this ancient civilization was the origins of human beings according to the sumerians there are countless different stories of creation with each culture religion and civilization having their own ideas whether you believe in the big bang theory a religious deity creating the universe or have a different understanding of the creation of the world how we each believe that the world was created as a fundamental part of our faith and beliefs the same was true for the sumerians unfortunately for modern historians we have very little evidence to support theories we have pieced together as to how this society saw the world in other words very little literature from the sumerian era survived meaning we cannot read lengthy descriptions of what could function as a holy text we are fortunate enough to have a few segments from tablets engraved with small sections we think refer to a time before there were gods however when we are forming a picture from such small clues the information is not necessarily wholly accurate throughout mesopotamia as a whole literary evidence seems to suggest that individual gods were associated with various natural forces resulting in a number of myths interacting with one another as opposed to a belief in a singular story of creation whereas today with christianity for example the one christian god created the world or in hinduism it was brahma the god of creation who created the universe the sumerians and many mesopotamian civilizations had a number of coexisting deities the first assumption that modern historians believe the sumerians held is that the gods are simply older than the world and therefore the formation of the gods themselves is not discussed at least not according to literature we have found a few of the tablet sections mentioned above do tell a story before earth was formed though it does not describe the gods themselves there was no moonlight or sunlight meaning that everything was in darkness the earth was described as green and the ground did hold water but no plants grew this description is derived from a third millennium sumerian poem a particularly rare find though some second millennium artifacts do contain further descriptions as to how earth and life were formed gilgamesh and the netherworld as it is called today is one relatively well-known sumerian myth this tale tells us that there was once a time when both earth and the heavens were won though they were eventually torn apart the gods known collectively as the great gods once humanity was created each took on various roles to maintain control over the separate realms earth the heavens and the netherworld respectively according to one sumerian poem enki and ninma the gods of lower status the ones who were tasked with the physical creation of the earth begun to complain to nama the mother nama then asked enki her son to find an alternative solution so that the gods were not forced to continue to work so laboriously enki then took some clay and put it inside of her womb ready to then birth the first ever humans despite this clay sculpture the creation of humans comes in an entirely different story this sumerian poem the song of the ho described the god ending the god who is considered responsible for the division of earth and the heavens as creating humankind the creation of humans was driven with a purpose for us to provide for the great gods the idea of humans catering to the gods is a recurring theme throughout a lot of mesopotamian literature some other myths and poems written by the sumerians surrounding the creation of the world as we know it include the debate between grain and sheep which tells us how the gods gave us humans quite simply grain and sheep to eat before this the earth was barren and a wasteland by today's standards humans wandered naked drinking from ditches and eating merely grass similarly the debate between bird and fish says that we did not have drinking water until enki the lord of wisdom allowed water to flow from mountains another poem enki and the world order details the organization of our planet and some speak of hierarchy even between the gods within many of the sumerian creation beliefs there are some clear similarities and links to be drawn towards some modern day religions equally many of the poems and myths do seem fairly unique to the sumerian civilization the great number of poems and stories interact with each other in a way that may appear entirely alien to a number of people in our modern society we most likely will never know just how accurate the information we have is due to there being so little preserved literature but nonetheless the research gained from studying the past is invaluable and will show us just how advanced ancient societies really were the mystery of the anunnaki many religions and cultures around the world today worship a number of deities not just the one the sumerians were no different one particular group of deities that were worshipped were known as the anunnaki and it was not just the sumerians who worshipped these figures the akkadians assyrians and the babylonians are all known to have looked up to respected and worshipped the anunnaki too though there is still a great deal we still do not know about them the earliest record we have of the anunnaki can be traced back to sumerian writings describing the anunnaki as being descendants of anne the god of the heavens and ki the goddess of the earth which as we know from various poems discussed earlier used to be united as one so what was the role of the anunnaki to determine the fate and the destiny of the humans here on earth the vast majority of the evidence we have to support the ideas surrounding the anunnaki comes from the written word furthermore whilst texts typically only refer to the group as a set unit drawn visual depictions only seem to show the anunnaki as individuals with only two or three members being identified from these images the understanding of these gods from mesopotamia is mixed though many historians think they were believed to have had powers of being incredibly large in physical size being covered in a frightening substance referred to as melum and more often than not the anunnaki were horned caps for the sumerians specifically the mythology surrounding the anunnaki was a little different the group was made of the seven gods who decree meaning an enlil enki inhesag nana utu and inanna these have all been described as anunnaki though we have no complete list that has survived and stood the test of time many argue about the true number of anunnaki whilst others argue over what their official role was in sumerian mythology many of these deities were thought to represent specific celestial bodies for example inanna was thought of as venus and utu the sun though this went further with an and enki being in orbit with points that would intersect this thought and attention to detail without high-tech equipment shows such a great sense of promise for the field of astronomy however the uncertainty about the anunnaki does not end there some popular conspiracy theories such as aliens building the pyramids and ideas about reptilian overlords have been credited to the anunnaki with some suggesting these deities are the cause of such sightings and coincidences most famously perhaps was the 2012 prediction that the anunnaki would return and wipe out the human race due to this being the end of the mesoamerican long count calendar perhaps we may never know precisely who the anunnaki were to the sumerians though we have plenty of questions to help us fill in the blanks suma civilization the sumerians were incredibly advanced for one of the earliest known civilizations despite their time on earth occurring incredibly early on it did not take long for the civilization to thrive some of the most important aspects of the sumerian civilization from an archaeological historical and linguistic point of view is the writing form the sumerians used suniform scripts to convey messages engraved into it this helps us to bridge the gaps between hieroglyphs and runes which would eventually become the written word interestingly the sumerian language does not belong to a language group such as germanic romantic or scandinavian languages and so the language exists somewhat in isolation another key cultural aspect is the religious focus and close tie of faith and religion to cosmology some other key surprisingly advanced aspects of sumerian civilization include agriculture art the economy and technology all these aspects of the summer civilization are what have led to the world as we know it today even the most ancient societies can tell us so much about the world as we know it hopefully one day we will find out more about those who came before us but what do you make of this ancient civilization be sure to let us know your thoughts in the comments section below and help us by growing this community while working to solve these unexplained
