"NARRATOR: Northern Iraq,\nalong the east bank of the Tigris River. Opposite the city of Mosul lie\nthe ruins of the ancient city of Nineveh, a place originally\ninhabited by the Sumerians of Mesopotamia. Here, in 1842, British\narchaeologist Austen Henry Layard unearthed the\nruins of the great library of Ashurbanipal, a\nroyal archive containing thousands of clay tablets\nwith cuneiform inscriptions. Dating to 3000 BC, the\nmessages carved into stone are considered to be the\nworld's first written accounts. Sumerian tablets\nare probably one of the oldest form of a\nwritten record that we have. They've been translated, and\nthey tell exciting stories about how gods intermingled\nwith human beings and actually had a hand in\nthe creation of human beings. Whether or not it's just\nmythology or if it's fact, no one really knows. NARRATOR: According\nto interpretations of the Sumerian tablets, the\ngods were called the Annunaki. What we're looking at\nhere is a Sumerian tablet that actually shows the tree of\nlife flanked by divine beings. You can see here the\nAnnunaki on each side. We also see the winged\ndisk, a symbolic reference that the Annunaki had\nthe power of flight. They actually had necklaces\nwith astronomical references-- a moon, a star, various\nsymbols, which even could be symbolized as a\nwristwatch, technology being used 6,000 years ago. NARRATOR: The written\naccounts etched into stone suggest the Annunaki were giant\nbeings standing 8 feet tall who came to Earth in search\nof gold for their home planet. JASON MARTELL: When the\nSumerian gods, the Annunaki, realized the toll it was taking\nto mine the gold themselves, they decided to\nfashion a worker being, a slave to mine\nthe gold for them. And they explain in the\nSumerian creation tales that this was an\narduous process. So it's very possible that our\ngenetic evolution was a process done by the Annunaki to\ncreate us in their image and after their likeness. They created man, according\nto the Sumerian text. They created Adam and Eve. How interesting that the Bible\nwill echo the story but talk about it in terms of god. NARRATOR: Ancient chronicles of\nsky beings creating human life are common in early cultures\nfound all over the world. But while mainstream scholars\noften dismiss this evidence, might such tangible\nhistorical accounts provide proof of\nalien intervention in man's evolution? The Sumerians are not the only\nculture that talks about this. Also in the Quran it\nsays that language was given to us by Allah, or god. The Maya Popol Vuh\nsays that language was given to us by the gods. The ancient Egyptian texts are\nsaying the exact same thing. We should finally come\nto grips with the idea that extraterrestrials\nhad something to do with our development. "
