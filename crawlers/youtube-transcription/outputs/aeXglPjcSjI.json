"the anunaki live on the planet Nibiru which orbits our system they are an ancient race of extremely developed and Powerful beings and can be considered gods in human eyes but even the great Anunnaki suffered from the terrible environmental conditions on their Planet a large crack had formed in nibiru's Ozone layer this crack widened every decade increasing global warming and destroying crops and animal life the Anunnaki discovered that pouring Gold Dust particles into the atmosphere slowed down the expansion of the crack even reversing it slightly but Nibiru was a mineral poor planet and gold was extremely scarce the lack of food quickly led to revolt among the population groups of rebels challenged the central government of Nibiru and a chaotic wave was about to sweep through every city on the planet the rebels were led by alalu who despite being part of Nibiru Noble lineage did not have a good relationship with his parents trying to execute audet alalu attacked and killed the king of Nibiru demanding the throne for himself however there was an heir by right of lineage Prince Anu a public duel was organized to decide the new ruler of Nibiru Anu and alalu fought unarmed and after a fierce fight Anu was chosen as the new king of Nibiru alalu was judged for his actions but before the sentence was handed down he managed to steal a ship and escape from Nibiru King Anu decided that Exile was punishment enough for alalu and decided to commit his efforts to saving his Planet Anu realized that the only viable solution would be to find the precious gold on other celestial bodies many space Expeditions were made to the planet's closest to Nibiru but the results were dismal as gold veins were scarce when hope was almost nil a massive breakthrough was made on the third closest planet to the Sun a true Paradise had been found most of the planet was covered with water with large portions of land that harbored a huge diversity of animal and plant life even more important to the anunaki there were many ores waiting to be exploited including precious gold to the amazement of nibiru's entire Royal Court the person responsible for the discovery was the exile alalu as a result of his vital contribution he was pardoned for his crimes the Anunnaki dubed the planet Kai but it was later known as planet Earth the Anunnaki chose a region now known as Mesopotamia to build a wonderful city called aidu King anu's eldest son named eni was in charge of the Metropolis while his father continued as ruler of the planet Nibiru after 7 Days of hard work the anunaki completed the construction of aidu they began the processes of extracting gold which after being collected in considerable quantities was sent to Nibiru extracting gold was an arduous and painful process therefore the Anunnaki decided to resort to forc labor from an alien race called the iiji who had long before been defeated in battle and dominated by the anunaki after hundreds of years the planet Nibiru was practically reestablished on account of the massive amount of gold mined from Earth but the aiji could no longer stand suffering in the gold mines and organized a fullscale rebellion a great War inevitably occurred between the anunaki and the aiji the city of IDU was badly damaged and many gold mines collapsed despite their courage and determination the aiji were no match for the anunaki in strength and Technology they were quickly subdued but the anunaki realized that the the aiji had already done much to restore Nibiru and forcing them to work would only result in new rebellions a new solution had to be created the anunaki decided to create a new race of living beings capable of working and learning but inferior to the aiji in strength and size to do this the anunaki used the womb of a female primate that inhabited the forests and using advanced technology inseminated her with the anunaki essence but the results were grotesque giving rise to terrifying monsters such as Cyclops gorgens and two-headed Giants the method of conception had failed the other alternative was to use the essence of a male primate and after modifying its DNA to inseminate it into the womb of an Anunnaki woman after a few months of waiting the first baby was born who was given the name adamu his skin was tanned with a reddish tint although he was much smaller than the the anunaki babies adamu was just like his creators it was the birth of the first human being the anunaki also conceived a woman named hia to fulfill the requirements necessary for human procreation centuries after the birth of adamu and hea humans represented a sizable population in the city of aru the anunaki were pleased with the development of the humans who soon became able to mine gold build houses and even plant and harvest crops as a reward for their efforts the humans were allowed to frequent the Eden a sacred Garden created by the anunaki the beauty of human women started to attract some anunaki but the relationship between the two races was strictly forbidden but eni himself King of the city of eridu eventually fell in love with a human woman from this relationship the boy adapa was born he became a very talented and wise man man for he was the direct son of a noble anunaki adapa also had a longer life than most humans but he was not Immortal adapa married a woman named atiti and they gave birth to a new line of humans who were more intelligent than the previous generation but ota's children also inherited the Anunnaki Lust For Gold and desire for power this gave rise to Violent Behavior among the humans ota's two oldest Sons named Cain and Abel were the closest Servants of the Anunnaki and competed with each other to see who their masters could please the most tired of standing behind his brother Abel Cain waited until they were alone using a wooden Club he murdered his brother never before had a human killed another which was a surprise to the anunaki as punishment Cain had his forehead marked with a symbol pointing to him as a murderer and was exiled from IDU he was condemned to live forever in the world without ever finding peace for his soul there were other similar cases later against the anunaki orders humans began to procreate excessively aidu quickly became unable to provide shelter for so many people and food sources were scarce in Eden's Garden as the planet Nibiru was recovered mining gold in large quantities was no longer necessary the Anunnaki decided to expel the humans from their Sacred City and garden condemning them to live in the fields and forests after being driven out of aidu by the anunaki the humans began to wander aimlessly around the world but something unexpected happened some Anunnaki and iiji secretly had love affairs with humans the children generated between the anunaki and humans were capable of amazing things being being considered demigods that would leave their names eternalized in legends of several peoples some of the most famous were Gilgamesh Hercules Perseus and Samson but the children of the aiji with humans were beastial and evil Giants who became forever known as Nephilim they usually lived in Hill caves but attacked human dwellings and caused much trouble for the anunaki even without the anunaki support the humans flourished and bu built cities of their own without the Anunnaki to dictate rules the humans went into decadence thievery debauchery and violence were common in the cities and it seemed impossible to control human barbarism but everything was about to change the orbit of the planet Nibiru was approaching the Earth an event that only happened every 3,600 years the anunaki knew of the impending disaster as Nibiru would reverse the Earth's magnetic poles causing earthquakes volcano eruptions and tsunamis the Anunnaki final decision was to abandon humans return to their ships and flee into space where they would remain orbiting planet Earth until the natural disasters were over against the wishes of his advisers and family members King enki decided that the human race deserved a chance to save itself from the cataclysm he commissioned udap pist a good-natured man to create a giant ship called the preser R of life in preparation for a giant flood that would end life on Earth even in the face of the mockery of humans utnapishtim dutifully carried out en's instructions and built the ship utnapishtim also sheltered and protected the essence of all the animals on Earth enki ordered that the technology of the anunaki be used to collect the DNA of one male and one female from each animal specimen found when the Great ship was finally ready the sign of approaching Nibiru could be felt all over the world those who had mocked utnapishtim now feared the result of their arrogance as predicted the Earth was devastated by an unprecedented disaster earthquakes ripped the surface of the Earth setting up new continents volcanoes spewed lava and glowing smoke incinerating everything in their path finally a torrential rain raised the level of the oceans which even covered the Summit of some mountains the splendorous city of eridu and the Garden of Eden were destroyed as were the terrible giant Nephilim but despite these Horrors utnapishtim's ship held out and floated until the water returned to normal levels unveiling a reborn world with the help of the anunakis technology life on Earth was restored powerful new cities were gradually built such as Babylon husa and noos humans revered the anunaki again worshiping them as gods and building temples in their honor the human race occupied the new territories that arose After the flood creating distinct civilizations each representing the anunas deities according to local beliefs but peace was again threatened as enki's younger brother named en leil wanted to be Earth's Chief ruler the Anunnaki allowed humans to have their own Kings in their cities but Ani was The Sovereign of Earth with the title King of Kings this position aroused enil's Envy the Rivalry between enki and enil became greater and greater mainly because enil disliked humans and despised the fact that his brother had helped them survived the flood and Leo believed that humans were mere laborers with limited intelligence he never agreed with the accelerated development that the human race achieved with the anunaki help to Plate the situation en suggested a political marriage between his son dumuzid and enana and Le's granddaughter but enki's eldest son named Marduk did not accept this idea since he intended to unseat his father and uncle and assume the title of King of Kings himself mardic devised a plan that caused the accidental death of his brother dumuzid with the end of the arranged marriage the enmity between anky and enl escalated mardic was punished for the crime and exiled to a lonely desert when he was informed of the disputes between the anunaki living on Earth King Anu of Nibiru decided to intervene Anu pardoned Marduk who was released from Exile and allowed to be among the anunaki Anu also ended the feud between Ani and enlil he promised the two brothers and other anunaki of Royal lineage a territory for each to rule on Earth en Leo was given the region of Mesopotamia eni got Egypt inana got Persia and nma was given the Sinai region the pardon given to Marduk did not entitle him to rule a territory disgruntled Marduk demanded Babylon a city in which he became the main deity mardic decided to challenge the other anunaki and contrary to anu's orders taught his human subjects The Secret of producing iron weapons and armor creating the best equipped Army at the time thirsty for power mardik ordered the construction of Hanging Gardens in Babylon to replicate the Splendor of the ancient Garden of Eden which had been devastated in the flood not only that mardic also ordered the construction of a great tower that was to reach the Clouds Of Heaven defying King Anu the Tower of Babel quickly reached an impressive height as the construction was intended to overshadow all the other anunaki buildings on Earth the outrage was not ignored by the remaining Anunnaki and each leader started preparing human armies to face mardic obeying marduk's orders the Babylonian armies marched out to conquer and enslave other nations this was the beginning of a great wave of wars and conflicts between the strongest peoples of the Bronze Age the Anunnaki constantly changed sides and formed alliances with each other leading to chaos and destruction and many major cities mic's armies managed to dominate Egypt and Si to confront the other Anunnaki Marduk humiliated or annihilated the conquered humans with no other way out eni and his brother in leil joined forces with the authorization of King Anu they used the technology of the Anunnaki weapons and ships to fight mardic an extreme decision with many detrimental consequences to the world the destruction caused by the Anunnaki weapons led to multiple natural disasters volcanoes earthquakes and tsunamis destroyed entire civilizations crops disappeared due to air contaminated by volcanic ash with famine becoming ubiquitous desperate humans abandoned cities or formed marauding groups to attack more fertile lands these Grim events were recorded as the Bronze Age collapse after causing such a catastrophe on the world the Anunnaki realized that the wars would never end and could destroy the entire planet Earth to Halt the debacle Anu ordered all the Anunnaki to return to Nibiru and let the Earth be ruled by humans some human leaders descended from the Anunnaki were chosen to rule the rest until the day when the anunaki will return to Earth to choose the people worthy of being taken to Nibiru where they will live forever as Immortals "
