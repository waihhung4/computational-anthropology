"Transcriber: Francesca Sacco\nReviewer: Queenie Lee Today, I'm going to be talking about\na theory you've never heard of, and hopefully by the end of it,\nyou'll think, as I do, that it really is something\nthat nobody talks about, and yet it has changed the world\nand continues to change the world. It's called the Hamitic hypothesis. It's an idea that developed\nover hundreds of years, became very popular in the 19th century, but continues to affect parts\nof the world today, particularly Africa. It's the subject of a book\nthat I've written, that will be coming out\nin a couple of months, called The Lost White Tribe: Explorers, Scientists,\nand the Theory that Changed a Continent. This story - Well, I should tell you,\nI'm a historian of exploration, and that's my job. I look at explorers, expeditions, and cultural encounters\nwith people around the world, and why people think these expeditions\nare so important, back home. And this story of the lost white tribe,\nwhich I'm going to be talking about, and the Hamitic hypothesis, really grew out of a book\nI wrote about ten years ago called The Coldest Crucible,\nand that was about Arctic exploration. And in a way, I never would have imagined\nthat this book about the Arctic would have led me to the project\nI'm working on now, because this book is about the Arctic, and the Hamitic hypothesis\nis really about Africa, but it actually grew out of part\nof that earlier topic. I was writing about Arctic exploration. I was particularly interested\nin American explorers, and how in the 1800's, American explorers found it\nso interesting to go to the Arctic, a really dangerous place. Many dozens of Americans\nlost their lives going there, either to try to find a Northwest Passage\nor to get to the North pole. But I found this story of one explorer,\nhis name was Vilhjalmur Stefansson, and he went to the Arctic, not to try to get to the North pole,\nbut to find undiscovered peoples. While he was in the upper region of Canada in a place called Victoria Island, he discovered a group of Inuit,\nwhich he described when he came back as being blond, of being\nwhat he called blond Eskimos. I thought this was the most bizarre story,\nbut I could not stop reading about it. There were stories\nall over the US at the time. In fact, the worldwide press\ntook up the story of the Blonde Eskimos of Victoria Island. Some people thought\nit was a complete fake, that it was a hoax. Other people thought it was an amazing kind of discovery\nthat needed to be explained. But I had nothing that I could do with it, it had no part to play\nin the story I was telling. So I tucked it away in a file, and what I found was\nthat over the next six years or so, I started finding more and more kind of stories of these white tribes that people had discovered\nall over the world. So for example, in Panama, Richard Marsh finds a group\nthat he calls the white Indians. In Central Asia, there is a group of people who said\nthey found Tibetans who looked Aryan. In parts of Africa, people\nwere finding white tribes as well. And in Japan, people discovered\nin the late 19th century, a group called the Ainu\nin the northern island of Japan, which they said looked like Caucasians. So, by the time I got to about 2008, I had this giant file of kind of weird\nwhite tribe discoveries, and I figured now is the time\nto do something with it. But there was one story in particular\nthat I was interested in, and that was the story of a discovery that took place\nin East Africa in the 1870s - in that red box you see there. It happened just to the west\nof Lake Victoria, one of the largest lakes in the world, and it was made by a very\nfamous explorer, Henry Morton Stanley. Now, Stanley may have been familiar to you\nas the guy who discovers Livingstone, or rescues Livingstone,\nin the heart of Africa in 1869. In fact, the phrase\n\"Dr. Livingstone, I presume?\" was supposedly something that Stanley\nsaid to Livingstone when they met. This was one of the most famous\nexpeditions of the 19th century. But, Stanley went back to Africa\nand went back many times, and on his subsequent\nexpedition to Africa, he went not to find Livingstone, but to try to discover\nthe source of the Nile. People knew by the late 1800s that there were many lakes\nin the areas of East Africa, what we call the Rift Valley\nof East Africa, and that one of these lakes\nwould have been the source of the Nile, something that geographers\nhad been searching for, for 2,000 years. But Stanley said, \"I'm going to figure out\nwhich of these lakes it actually is.\" So he treks into East Africa,\nand he determines with great confidence that Lake Victoria\nis the ultimate source of the Nile, 4,000 miles of Nile River,\nand that is the source. But what he also discovers is something\nthat in a sense creates a new mystery, which is he finds that there are\nmembers of an African soldier force that are protecting him, which look white, and he calls them\n\"Greeks in white shirts.\" He can't believe how\nlight complected these Africans are. He asks other members\nof his expedition party, \"Who are these men?\" and they say, \"They come\nfrom the mountains to the West on a mountain called Gambaragara.\" So he writes about this\nand sends these reports back home, and the illustrations of his narrative\nactually show Mount Gambaragara over on the left-hand side\nof the illustration, you can see it in the background. This became a huge story, back home, this lost white race that Stanley\nhad found in the heart of Africa. How in God's name would Stanley have explained this\nin the late 18th century? What kind of theoretical background\ncould people use or information? Why you would find a group of white people\nliving in the heart of Africa? In fact, Stanley,\nvery much as a man of the 1800s, was at this transition moment between people who use the Bible as a way\nof explaining the history of the world and people who use science as a way\nof explaining the history of the world. So when Stanley thought about it, he actually looked back\nto the Middle Ages, when people tried\nto explain the differences that we saw in the peoples of the world,\nwhat we would call racial differences, and look to the stories of Genesis,\nin particular the story of Noah. And in the story of Noah,\nwe all know about Noah and the flood, but a lot of people don't know\nwhat happened after the flood, which was Noah parks the Arch\non the top of Mount Ararat, disembarks with his family\nas well as his three sons, Sem, Japheth, and Ham. And it was really these three sons\nthat many people in the Middle Ages - by that, we're talking about\nJews, Christians, and Muslims - all look to this story\nas a kind of explanation for how the world got repopulated\nafter it was annihilated in Genesis 9. And as you see here, this is a medieval map\nshowing the three sons of Noah on the three known\ncontinents of the world. Asia, on the top - you see\nthe little arch there at the very top, hanging out on the top of Ararat. And Sem, the base of the word Semitic\ncomes from Sem, Noah's son. And then in the bottom\nleft corner is Europe - this map is rotated east, by the way. On the bottom left, you see,\nEurope, and that's Japheth. And then the forerunner\nof all Africans, people thought, were the descendants of Ham. So when Stanley talks\nabout this white tribe, he says, \"Somehow they must\nbe related to the tribe of Ham,\" and they became known as Hamites. But this was a transition point. And Stanley was a very smart man; he was also not just reading his Bible,\nhe was also reading Darwin, and he was reading Charles Lyell,\nwho were beginning to, in a sense, dismantle a kind of\nbiblical history of the world. Guys like Darwin and Lyell said, \"The world was not 6,000 years old;\nit's hundreds of thousands of years old\" - they had no idea how old it really was. But it was very, very old,\nand in addition to that, species maybe didn't stay fixed over time,\nmaybe species changed over time, maybe in fact, human beings\nwere once resembled something else. So Stanley began\nto try to adopt these old ideas and graph them to new ideas. And a lot of other people\nat that time did as well. Strangely enough, the Hamitic hypothesis, this idea that all Africans\ncame from the descendants of Ham, that son of Noah, somehow got weirdly flipped\nto \"No, Hamites are not all Africans, Hamites are some invasion of white people\nthat happened in the ancient past, and that this invasion of white people explains why we are finding\nwhite tribes all over the world.\" Now, if this sounds a little bizarre,\nlet me kind of reinforce. This was not some wacky idea, like, you know, scientists\nwho go looking for Sasquatch or people trying to prove ColdFusion. This was anthropologists,\nlinguists, paleontologists, all kinds of scientists\nfrom across the spectrum were interested in this. This is a map, for example, of an anthropologists\nnamed Griffith Taylor, who is actually trying\nto describe what he saw as the racial dispersion of groups\nout of Asia around the world. Now you look, and it kind of\nlooks like a swirling map, but just to orient you here,\nthe middle of the map is Asia. And as you see, there are these kind of initial flows\noutward of darker races. Now, Griffith Taylor believed that the first races\nof the human species were primitive, and that the later races\nof the species were more advanced. And like most 19th century Europeans\nand North Americans, when they thought\nabout primitive and advanced, they saw it also as a racial ladder, and that primitive meant dark skinned\nand advanced meant light skinned. So they created a kind of\ncolor map of the world: to give you another example,\nhe called this the Lava Flow analogy, that all of the races of the human species\nemerged first in Asia, and then gradually, the later, more advanced, races -\ni.e. the white race - kind of rolled over the other races\nand spread itself out as it conquered and overcame\nand drove to the edges the darker raced peoples of the world, either intermarrying with them\nor conquering them. So this was the idea\nthat could somehow explain why you would find\nwhite tribes in weird areas. It also happened to fit very nicely with what was happening\nin the late 19th century, which was new white tribes were taking\nover other places in the world. Europeans were madly scrambling\nfor colonial possessions from Asia to Africa. In fact, this map of Africa\nfrom the late 19th century shows, essentially, the color codes here are different color codes\nfor European countries: brown is France, green is Great Britain,\nblue is Belgium, and purple is Germany. Literally, all of Africa had been\ncarved up by European countries as they tried to grab colonies. So, the idea that there had been\nwhite ancestors who had done this before kind of fit the mode\nof European thinking at the time, and as European colonists\ncame into these parts of Africa, and they looked at various\ngroups of Africans, they said, \"These are the Hamites;\nthese are the proto-white people. Let's treat them slightly different than these people that we think of\nas being black African.\" So, over the course\nof the late 19th century, some groups, like the Bahima,\nthe Batusi of Rwanda, the Nyamwezi of Tanzania\nwere called white, and other groups were called,\nlike the Bahutu of Rwanda, were called black. Now, at the time, Africans themselves did not have\nthe same idea of racial concept, right? They thought mostly\nin terms of ethnic or clan terms, and yet, these ideas caught on. And it also allowed Europeans\nand North Americans, when they looked at the great kind of\nlegacy of African civilizations, when they looked, for example,\nat Great Zimbabwe or the great Pyramids, they said, \"Clearly, black cultures\ncouldn't have created these. These must have been the Hamites, right? Those ancient,\nhighly advanced white invaders who were here thousands of years ago. So this Hamitic hypothesis became a way of explaining,\njustifying, white colonization, as well as all of this cool stuff\nthat you find in Africa, and that was essentially taken away\nfrom Africans themselves. There is a very dark side\nto the Hamitic hypothesis as well, which is this: even after Europeans\nleft Africa in the 1960s and these countries became independent, even after the Hamitic hypothesis essentially was exploded\nas not being true, even after that time Africans themselves had started\nto adapt and adopt the Hamitic hypothesis as a part of their own history. So for example, the Batusi of Rwanda considered themselves\nas having an origin outside of Africa, and other groups in Africa as well. The Iraqw of Tanzania see themselves\nas having a Mediterranean origin, not an African one. And this racial conflict\nbetween the two groups was something that became important\nin the Rwandan genocide of 1994. It was much easier for the Hutu\nto see the Batusi as foreign, as literally non-African invaders\nof their own country, and made it that much easier for them\nto exterminate them. I'm not saying that's the only reason\nfor the Rwandan genocide, but it was one of the important factors. So that's the sad part of the story. But there's another part\nand I want to end on this other part, which is an interesting part of the story, which is we really haven't actually gotten\nback to the original question, which was: if these things aren't true, if Stanley wasn't actually seeing\nwhite people in the heart of Africa, then what was he seeing? So I went to Africa in 2013, and I actually climbed that mountain\nthat Stanley was looking at, which I was totally unprepared for. I mean, I run; I thought\nI was in pretty good shape, but this mountain is 17,000 feet high! There is a glacier on the top of it,\nand I wasn't really prepared for that. But here I am before I got to that point. (Laughter) And I wanted to see, as I told my guide,\nI wanted to see what Stanley saw, and my guide, who was a member\nof the Bakonzo tribe, he looked at me and said: \"There's no white people\non the top of that mountain, man.\" (Laughter) And I said, \"I know that there aren't.\" But I want to think about\nwhat Stanley saw. I came up with a provisional hypothesis,\nand the provisional hypothesis is this: I think Stanley did see difference;\nI think he did look at people and said, \"These people do not look\nanything like these people.\" We now know that in terms\nof human diversity, Africa is the most diverse\ncontinent in the world. There's more human diversity,\ni.e. physical diversity, in Africa than any other place because within Africa is a much longer\nevolutionary period of time for the human species than outside of it. So I think he did see human difference,\nand then it was filtered through - this is my own theory,\nand I'm very proud of it - it filtered what I call\nthe Mr. Magoo Hypothesis. (Laughter) So for those of you who are too young\nto remember Mr. Magoo, he was this Don Quixote-like figure who was so nearsighted\nthat you would stick him in a room, and he wouldn't really know where he was,\nand he thought he was somewhere else, but everything that he, like,\nbumped into or knocked into, he interpreted as if he\nwas in that other place because his expectations\nof where he was were so strong it filtered virtually\nall information coming in. And I think that almost all explorers -\nprobably all tourists - suffer from the Mr. Magoo hypothesis, which is that they too, in a sense,\nfilter everything they see through their expectations\nof what they should see. And I think Stanley, in a sense, wanted to see people\nwho were like him, who were European. He was a desperately lonely man;\nhe was living in Africa for three years, oftentimes without anyone else\nfrom Europe or North America, and I think in a sense,\nhe wanted to identify with people and saw this difference - cheekbones,\naquiline nose, lighter skin color - and traced that as white. Ultimately, to finish it off, why should\nwe remember this strange hypothesis? OK. It was a kind of inkblot test\nfor the way people looked at the world. But ultimately, I think we should\nremember the Hamitic hypothesis because when we think about\nmaster races and Aryan domination, we think about kind of the very short,\nvery violent history of Nazi Germany, but in fact, there was a much longer\nand a much more profound racial theory that continues to exist today,\nand that is the Hamitic hypothesis. Thanks very much. (Applause) "
