"(soft piano music) - [Narrator] We're in the Shanghai Museum, and we're looking at a\nvery early Oracle Bone. And this is so important\nbecause this brings us to the very beginnings of\nwriting in ancient China. - [Narrator] The Oracle\nBone is on an ox scapula, so it's actually the shoulder blade here that you can see carved\nlittle tiny characters from the right to the\nleft, all in little lines. - [Narrator] And those\ncharacters are still, many of them, recognizable\nas Chinese characters today. - [Narrator] Yeah, about\n40% of them, actually are decipherable, and we\nhave tons of these remaining. We have about 200,000 of them. - [Narrator] We're not\nreally used to the idea in the west that we could read writing that's more than 3,000 years old. - [Narrator] And, of course,\nthis is really important, because you can read history through it. When we have a group of\nthese objects together, we can look back and\nsee how things evolved on this particular year, what\nkinds of concerns people had. - [Narrator] It's an Oracle Bone, so we know that it something\nthat could divine the future, that could help people understand what the future might bring. - [Narrator] They would get these bones, they would inscribe the questions on them, and then a diviner would come\nand use a particular ritual that involved a heated rod, a metal rod, that they would touch to the bone, and the way that the cracks would evolve on the questions would divine the future. - [Narrator] So the cracks\nwould be read by someone who had a kind of special power. - [Narrator] The questions\nwere all directed toward somebody named Shangdi, the deified ancestor of\nthe Shang royal cult. And we're talking about the Shang Dynasty, this is in the cradle of civilization, the Yellow River Valley, the capital. And the kinds of questions\nthat people would ask would involve everything from the very mundane to ritualistic things. When should a sacrifice be performed, a particular rite of worship. This one we're looking\nat, a question about the bumper harvest, when to be planting. - [Narrator] And, ancestor worship was incredibly important\nduring the Shang Dynasty, and that's something that will change with the next dynasty, the Zhou Dynasty. - [Narrator] Now, when\nwe get into the Zhou, we see a different concept of the divine. - [Narrator] So, Shangdi\nwas the particular ancestor/god of the Shang Dynasty. - Exactly, royalty.\n- And it makes sense with the - next dynasty--\n- Exactly (drowned out). - you'd have to adjust that.\n- You'd have to adjust. - [Narrator] So, we see these on, especially on scapula of oxen, but also other animal bones,\nand also tortoise shell. - [Narrator] Tortoise shell\nis another favorite medium, probably also as tortoise\nwas an important mythological creature from very early times. But, here, you can see that\nthe medium itself is very flat, it's a good surface to carve into. And, when we're looking\nat these kinds of things, keep in mind that this is what we have. We have bones, these\nstood the test of time, but that doesn't mean that there wasn't also writing on other things. - [Narrator] And the\nwriting that we're seeing, we know that Chinese\ncharacters stand for words, but, perhaps, at this time in history, the signs that we're seeing\nare more pictographic-- - Yeah, they've been--\n- until it evolved. - [Narrator] Yeah, they've\nbeen slowly decoded and, actually, art historians have spent quite a bit of time\ntrying to decipher this, enough so that we can read them, but, at this point, writing\nis a functional medium. It's to communicate, in\nthis example, with the gods. Eventually, it evolves into calligraphy, which becomes this art form. - [Narrator] And, so, the\nimportance of Chinese writing here in this very early moment. - [Narrator] A lot of major developments in Chinese society right, we've got centralized power as a\nmajor theme coming out of the writing, the idea\nthat people can communicate and organize, and this idea\nof creating a history here. - [Narrator] And, so\nlucky that we can at least untangle 40% of it, - Yeah, 40%.\n- of these thousands of bones that survive. - Exactly.\n- And, one day, we'll understand even more of them. - [Narrator] Even more of them, exactly.
