"China, it's big and it lasted a long time,\nbut we've put all of it into one video. Nope, no, we haven't, that would not be right. This video will cover about the same amount\nof time as Ancient Egypt, so it's a long amount of time, but still ancient history. The location of China had a lot of influence\non its history and culture. Flights to China from the outside world were\nreally hard to get back then. Really, really, hard, since airplanes were\nnot invented for a few thousand years after the time we're talking about. The Yangtze River and the Huang He River or\nthe Yellow River were the rivers in China where early Chinese civilizations began. To the north and west of those river valleys\nthere are very large deserts, and to the south, the Himalayan mountains. And of course, to the East is the Pacific\nOcean, the largest ocean in the world. So, getting to and from China during ancient\ntimes from the West was very difficult and often deadly which kept these civilizations\nfrom others' influence, trade and sometimes invasions for thousands of years. The period of Chinese history this chapter\nwill focus is the bronze age until the Han Dynasty, over 2000 years. The Yellow River was not an easy place for\nearly people to live. While the river's water was important for\ngrowing food, it also flooded often. These floods were sometimes made worse by\nearly solutions to contain the river. The thing about floods though, is that they\nare far too large for anyone to fight alone. So, the river created a problem that needed\npeople to work together or, dragons! Okay, before we get to the dragons, we should\nback up a bit. Like other civilizations, people began faming\nby the rivers, mostly growing millet near the Yellow River in the north, and mostly\nrice near the Yangtze River in the south. The copper, tin and bronze ages of prehistory\nhappened and during the bronze age, dynasties began to govern the people. A dynasty is a period of time where a family\nhas the ruling power, often for many people's lives, and in China the ruling dynasty was\nbelieved to have the mandate of heaven. The mandate of heaven was the idea that the\ndynasty in power was meant to be in power, as if a divine force decided it. When a dynasty lost power, it was believed\nthat they lost the mandate of heaven, and the new rulers earned it. Basically, it's the idea that whoever is in\ncharge is supposed to be in charge, because they're in charge. The first dynasty, the Xia, is thought to\nbe a myth by historians. Stories of the Xia are mostly about its most\nfamous leader, Yu the Engineer. Yu wasn't the typical engineer that sat at\na drawing board measuring, calculating, and making models, Yu was a bit more... hands-on? Stories of Yu include him teaming up with\nmer-men river spirits, turning into a bear, taming and defeating monsters... one with\nnine heads, almost never seeing his wife (okay, some engineers probably do that) and asking\ndragons to redirect the river and flood waters. Anyone that's ever worked with dragons can\ntell you, they never make more coffee in the break room, they're always giving spoilers\nat the water cooler and they're just terrible with paperwork. Now stories of mythical creatures in ancient\ncities are very common, stories of gods, and creatures and god-creatures starting cities\nand civilizations are found throughout the world. So, while the stories of the Xia may not be\ntrue, it's still a bit of a historical mystery. "
