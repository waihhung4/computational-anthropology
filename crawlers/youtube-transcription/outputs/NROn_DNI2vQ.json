"amy Andunaki gods from another planet visited Earth 445,000 years ago in pursuit of gold. They landed with a splash in one of Earth's oceans and built Eridu home in the far away. A full-fledged mission Earth eventually emerged from the virtual community complete with a mission control center, a space port, mining operations, and even a waste station on Mars. The astronauts used genetic engineering to create primitive workers, whom a sapiens, since they were short on human resources. The new beginning was necessary after the cataclysmic delugeing of the planet. The astronauts took on the role of gods, giving humanity's civilization and the ability to worship. Then roughly 4,000 years ago, a nuclear catastrophe undid everything that had been accomplished. This was caused by visitors to Earth who were engaged in conflicts and wars. By and more hand drew information from the now famous Morehen collection private museum in Liechtenstein. It was once curated by his grandfather George Morehen for the Rothschild's curated artifacts, comprising of the Bible, clay tablets, ancient mythologies, and archaeological finds about what had happened on Earth, particularly the events that had occurred since the beginning of human history. But what had occurred on the astronauts' home planet Nebiru before the events on Earth? What had led to space travel, the demand for gold, and the creation of man? What feelings, conflicts, convictions, and morals, or lack thereof, led the main characters in the heavenly and space circus? What were the interactions between Nebiru and Earth that were tense? What conflicts erupted between the young and old, between those born on Earth, and those who had travelled from Nebiru? And to what extent was what transpired predetermined by destiny? A destiny whose account of the past contains the secret to the future. Would it not be fortunate if one of the main characters, an eyewitness who could tell the difference between fate and destiny, recorded for posterity the hell, where, when, and why, if it all, possibly the first and last things? But some accomplished just that, and foremost among them was the commander of the first crew of Nebiru astronauts. The biblical stories of creation, Adam and Dave, the Garden of Eden, the deluge, and the Tower of Babel, were based on writings made millennia earlier in Mesopotamia, particularly by the Anunaki Sumerians, according to scholars and theologians. And they, in turn, made it evident that they had read the writings of the Anunaki, those who, from heaven to earth, came. The ancient gods from which they had learned about historical events, many of which took place before civilization had even emerged. Many such early texts have been discovered due to archaeological discoveries made over the past 150 years in the ruins of ancient civilizations, particularly in the Near East. The discoveries have also revealed the extent of missing texts, or so-called Lost Books, which are either mentioned in the discovered texts, or inferred from such texts, or known to have existed, because they were cataloged in royal or temple libraries. The epic of Gilgamesh described the debate between the gods that resulted in the decision to let mankind perish in the deluge. And the text, Arta Hase's, describes the revolt of the Anunaki who had labored in the gold mines that resulted in the creation of primitive workers, earthlings. Both contain portions of what is sometimes referred to as the secrets of the gods. The leaders of the astronauts occasionally wrote compositions themselves. Sometimes they dictated the text to a selected scribe, as in the era epoch, where one of the two gods who had brought about the nuclear catastrophe attempted to blame his rival. Other times, the gods served as his scribe, as in the case of the Book of the Seek of Thuth, Egyptian god of knowledge, which the god had hidden in an underground chamber. The Bible claims that before giving the commandments to his chosen people, the Lord god yawer wrote them on two stone tablets he delivered to Moses on Mount Sinai. He recorded the words the Lord spoke to him while he was on the Mount for 40 days and 40 nights. Moses had the new set of tablets written on them when he flung down and smashed the original set after the golden carf event. The Book of the Seek of Thuth would not have been known if it weren't for a story about it preserved on papyrus from the reign of the Egyptian monarch Kufu, Chi-h-o-s. We would never have known about the divine tablets and their contents. Everything would have been included in the mysterious body of lost writings, whose very existence would have never been discovered if it weren't for the biblical narratives in Exodus and toe toronomy. But least two occasions suggested that the biblical narrator was aware of prior works. The fact that, in some instances, we are aware that some messages exist but are unaware of their contents is no less terrible. The Bible explicitly references the Book of Dasha, also known as the Book of Righteousness and the Book of the Wars of Yawer. This is the Book of the Generations of Adam, says the first line of Genesis chapter five. Tulledoth typically translated as Generations means Historic or Genealological Record. The second time is in Genesis 6-1, where the phrase, these are the Tulledoth of Noah, is used to introduce the story of Noah and the Deluge. In addition, the Book of Enoch, one of the so-called apocryphal books that were not included in the canonized Bible, contains passages that scholars believed to be fragments from much earlier Book of Noah. In fact, partial versions of a book that became known as the Book of Adam and Eve have survived over the millennia in Armenian, Slovonic, Syriac and Ethiopia, languages. The famed Library of Alexandria in Egypt is a frequently cited illustration of the magnitude of Lost Books. In conflicts from 48 BC to the Arab conquest of AD642, this beautiful library, where intellectuals met to examine the body of knowledge was destroyed. After Alexander's demise in 323 BC, General Tullimi built a library with more than 500,000 volumes of literature engraved on diverse materials, clay, stone, papyrus and parchment. The first five volumes of the Hebrew Bible translated into Greek are all that is left of its richness. In addition, several of the library's resident scholars' papers still contain fragments. Only via this, do we know that in 270 BC, the Greeks gave the Egyptian priest Monatho a commissioned chronicle Egypt's history and prehistory. Then it was the demigods, and ultimately, around 3,100 BC, the ferryonic dynasty started. He said that the divine reigns lasted for thousands of years after the flood. During which time there were wars and battles between the gods, and that they had started 10,000 years before the flood. Retempts were made to give the Greeks' suffances a record of past events in Alexander's Asian territories, where their rule was transferred to General Celiusiid and his successes. The history of gods and men was chronicled in three volumes by Berusus, a priest of the Babylonian god, Marduk, who had access to clay tablet libraries, the most important of which was the temple library of Haran, now in Southeast Turkey. This history began 432,000 years before the deluge, when the gods descended to earth from the heavens. Berusus stated that the first ruler came ashore from the sea disguised as a fish, listing the names and rain lengths of the first 10 leaders. He was the one who endowed humanity with civilization, and his name was Karnes when translated into Greek. Both priests thus gave tales of gods of heaven who had come to earth, a time when only gods ruled on earth and of the devastating deluge, alluding to each other in numerous aspects. Berusus specifically reported the existence of writings from before the Great Flood. Stone tablets that were hidden for safe keeping in an ancient city called Sipar, one of the original cities founded by the ancient gods in the fragmentary bits and pieces retained in other contemporary writings from the three volumes. Sipar, like other pre-diluvial towns of the gods, was overrun and destroyed by the deluge, 668 to 633 BC. A library containing the remnants of some 25,000 inscribed plate tablets was unearthed in the palace's ruins when archaeologists discovered Ninver in the middle of the 19th century. This ancient Assyrian metropolis had previously only been known from the Old Testament. A mention of the pre-diluvial texts appeared in the Chronicles of the Assyrian Monarch Ashur Bonipar. Ashur Bonipar, who was a devoted collector of olden texts, boasting his annals, the god of scribes has bestowed on me the gift of the knowledge of his art. I have been initiated into the secrets of writing. I can even read the intricate tablets in Anunnaki Sumerian. I understand the enigmatic words in the stone carvings from the days before the flood. I Anunnaki Sumerian civilization, which later gave way to the Indus Valley civilization in the Indian subcontinent, is known to have flourished in Iraq almost a millennium before the beginning of the Faryonic Age in Egypt. It is now known that the Anunnaki Sumerians were the first to record the histories and legends of deities and humans. From them, all of the peoples, including the Hebrews, got the stories of creation, Adam and Eve, Kain and Abel, the Deluge, the Tower of Babel, and the Wars and Loves of the Gods, which are depicted in the writings and memories of the Greeks, itites, Kain andites, Persians and Indo-Europeans. These ancient manuscripts reveal that far all the texts, some discovered many lost were their sources. The amount of these ancient texts is astounding. They made the ruins of the ancient Near East tens of thousands of clay tablets have been found, not thousands. Numerous transactions involve or document daily life elements such as marriage contracts and workers' wages. Other canonized texts, or secret literature were written down in the Anunnaki Sumerian language and then translated to a Kadian, the first Semitic language and other ancient languages. These texts primarily found in palace libraries make up the Royal Analysts. Still other texts discovered in the ruins of Temple Library's Orce scribal schools make up a group of canonized texts. Additionally, references to missing books can be found in those earliest writings dating back almost 6,000 years. Texts inscribed on stone tablets. The same information concerning the 10 pre-Dyluvial kings and their 432,000-year cumulative reign that Barossa said mentioned is etched on clay prisms which are among the incredible to say. Luckily does not communicate the miracle findings in the remains of ancient towns and their libraries. There is no question that the Anunnaki Sumerian compilers of the Anunnaki Sumerian Kinglists which are on display in the Ashmolyam Museum in Oxford, England had access to some previous common or canonical textual material. They strongly imply that the original recorder of the arrival as well as of prior events and subsequent events had to be one of those leaders, a key participant or an eyewitness when combined with other equally early manuscripts found in varying levels of preservation. The leader who had splashed down with the first batch of astronauts had been a participant in all those activities and an eyewitness to them. His nickname at the time was EA which stands for, he whose home is water. He was disappointed when his half-brother and opponent, Enlil, Lord of the Command, was awarded control of the earth's mission and his humiliation was only slightly lessened by being given the title En key, Lord of Earth. AR, En key, a renowned scientist discovered the hominids who lived there after being vanished from the god cities and space-bought in the edin, eaten, to oversee the gold mining in the abzu, southeast Africa. As a result, when the Anunnaki laboring in the gold mines were belled and sent no more, he was the one who realized that the necessary human resources could be obtained by accelerating evolution through genetic engineering. As a result, the atom, literally he of the earth, an earthling, was created. The events mirrored in the biblical story of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden described the second genetic modification by En key that added the extra-cromosomal genes required for sexual conception. Because Adam was a hybrid, he was unable to have children. It was he, En key, who disobeyed his brother Enlil's intention to let mankind perish in the deluge. The events whose hero has been referred to as Noah in the Bible and Zeus Sudra in the earlier original Anunnaki Sumerian text, when mankind proliferating did not turn out as it had been planned. En key, Nibiru's ruler and the first born son of Anunn was well versed in the history of his planet and its inhabitants. He was a gifted scientist who left the most essential components of the sophisticated Anunnaki knowledge, particularly to his two sons, Maddo Kudnengish Zida, who, as Egyptian gods were known there as Rans, though, respectively. But he also played a crucial role in transferring some of this cutting-edge knowledge to mankind by imparting the secrets of the gods to a few chosen individuals. Such initiates recorded those divine lessons as part of human kinds inheritance in at least two cases, as they were told to do. One of the earliest lost writings is believed to have been written by a DARPA, who is thought to be the son of En key by a human woman. Writing's regarding time is one of his known works. The other known as En Maddo Ranki was most likely the forerunner of the biblical Enoc, who was carried up to heaven after giving his sons the book of divine secrets, a version that may have survived in the extra biblical book of Enoc. Despite being Anunnus' first-born, he was not meant to succeed his father as ruler of Nibiru. Enlil, Enki's half-brother, received that honour thanks to complicated succession procedures representing the complicated history of the Nibiruans. Enki and Enlil were sent to earth to stop the Acrimonious dispute, because earth's gold may be used to make a barrier to protect Nibiru's fanishing atmosphere. Enki decided to reject Enlil's plan for mankind to perish in the deluge against this backdrop, which was made even more complicated by the presence of their half-sister Ninhor Sarg, the chief medical officer of the Anunnaki on earth. The fight persisted between the two half-brothers' kids and even their grandchildren. The fact that everyone involved, especially those who were born on earth, had to deal with Nibiru's longer orbital periods reduction in longevity, contributed to their personal suffering and sharpened their goals. Everything reached ahead in the last century of the third millennium BC, when Enlil's first-born son and not Marduk, Enki's first-born by his official bride, asserted that he should inherit the earth. The employment of nuclear weapons due to the brutal fight, which included numerous conflicts, unexpectedly destroyed the Anunnaki's Sumerian civilization. The commencement of the priesthood, the lignages of the intermediaries between the gods and the people, the communicators of the divine words to the mortal earthlings, had been marked by the initiation of selected persons into the secrets of the gods. The call's interpretation of divine words co-existed with the practice of looking to the stars for signs, and prophecy started to come into play as mankind was drawn to join sides in religious disputes. Naboo, Marduk's first-born son, strove to persuade mankind on behalf of his ex-alt father that the heavenly signals indicated the coming supremacy of Marduk, and the term to describe such speakers of the gods who proclaimed what was the come was Naboo. These advances made the realization that one must distinguish between fate and destiny more acute. Enki and Enlil started to reflect philosophically on what was truly faded and could not have been avoided, and what was faded as a result of good or bad choices and free will. Enki and Enlil sometimes reviewed and remembered the sequence of events and the apparent parallelism between what had happened on the bureau and what had happened on earth. The differences between NAM, a destiny like the Plantry Orbits whose course had been established and was immutable and Anu, which were previously unquestioned, were now closely examined. Tahr, which stood for fate, literally meant a destiny that could be bent, broken or halted. The former could be predicted where is the latter could not, especially if everything was cyclical like Plantry Orbits. If what was will again be, if the first things will also be the last. The culmination of the nuclear apocalypse forced the Anunaki leaders to examine their motives, and it heightened the need to explain why it happened in this way to the engulfing human masses. Is someone responsible for this? Was it predetermined or just a byproduct of Anunaki's will? Was anyone accountable? On the eve of the catastrophe, Enki was the lone opponent of using the illegal weapon in the councils of the Anunaki. Enki felt it was imperative to inform the suffering survivors of the significance of the turning point in the story of aliens who had good intentions, but ended up being destroyers. And who better than Aya, Enki, who arrived first and was an eyewitness to tell the past so that the future could be predicted? Since a lengthy collection covering at least 22 tablets in the more-hand collection was found in the ancient library in Mosul, Enki documented his autobiography. Enki is quoted as saying by Nippur, there was a great deal of flooding when I got closer to earth. As I got closer to its lush meadows, at my direction, heaps and mounds were built up. I constructed my home in a purity spot, giving it a suitable moniker. The lengthy passage tells how Enki gave his lieutenant's task to complete, sending them on a trip to earth. Enki's story is completed by several additional books, some are partly in the more-hand collection in Liechtenstein and the other half in Switzerland, also in a private museum. They include a cosmogenee and an epic of creation, both of which contain Enki's own writings, known to researchers as the Eridue Genesis, and which relate various aspects of his participation in related developments. They go into great depth on how Adam was created. They include texts of Enki's personal life and problems, such as the tale of his attempts to have a son by his half-sister Ninhorseung. His promiscuity with both goddesses and the daughters of man, and the unintended consequences thereof. They describe how other Anunaki, male and female came to Enki in his city Eridue to obtain the May, a data disc from him that encoded all aspects of civilization. The division of earth's kingdoms between Enki and Enlil by Anu areverted a flare-up of their feuds, as noted in the Ahtraha'ses narrative. The discussions in the Council of the Gods about the fate of humanity and Enki's deception, which is known as the story of Noah and the Ark, are almost verbatim in texts documenting the events before the deluge. Until one of its original Mesopotamian versions was discovered in the tablets of the epic of Gilgamesh, this story was only known from the Bible. The main body of recorded memories of the events of Gods and mortals can be found in Anunaki Sumerian and Acadian clay tablets, Babylonian and Serian temple libraries, Egyptian, Itite and Canaanite myths and biblical tales. For the first time, Ryan Mohan has brought together and exploited this scattered and dispersed data to reconstruct Enki's eyewitness account. The autobiographical memoirs and incisive forecasts of an extra terrestrial god. Even though Ryan Mohan's grandfather was an aserialologist, who curated the collection of which it is named and he has also studied near Eastern history for almost 33 years, it took him seven years to gain access to the collection with special permission from the Rothschilds. It reminds me of Yahweh's instructions to the Prophet Isaiah, 7th century BC, which are presented as a text delivered by Enki to a chosen scribe, a book of witnessing to be unsealed at a suitable time. From now, write it as a book on a sealed tablet, carve it, let it be a testimony for all time witnessing to the very end. Isaiah 38 Enki himself saw the future while he dealt with the past, that the Anunaki who possessed free will were in control of their own fates, as well as the fate of humanity, gave way to the understanding that destiny ultimately determined how events would turn out, and as a result, as the Hebrew prophets had foretold, the first thing shall be the last. Thus the Enki recorded time-line serves as the basis for prophecy, and the past becomes the future. These are the words of En Dubsa, a brilliant scribe born in Eridu city who served the great god Enki. I was called by my master, the Lord Enki, the great god, the merciful creator of people who created them in the seventh year following the great calamity on the 17th day of the second month. I was one of Eridu's surviving members who fled to the dry step as the evil wind approached the city. I then set foot in the wilderness, searching for dead branches to use as firewood. I then turned to look above, and a whirlwind came from the south. It was silent, and had a reddish glow about it. Four straight feet extended out from its abdomen as it descended to the ground, and the brightness vanished. I immediately fell to the ground and bowed down, because I knew it was a divine vision. When I opened my eyes, I saw two divine emissaries stand in close by. They too had human faces, and their clothes sparkled like a furnished brass. They said, you are being called by the mighty deity Enki, as they addressed me by name. Do not be alarmed, you are blessed, and we are coming to transfer you to his retreat in the land of Magan, on the island in the middle of the river of Magan, where the sluces are, by lifting you into the air. So whirlwind rose as a fiery chariot, and left as they finished speaking. They each grasped one of my hands while holding onto me by the other. They immediately transported me between the earth and the heavens like an eagle as they lifted me. The countryside, rivers, plains, and mountains were all visible to me. They then dropped me off on the island near the entrance to the home of the giant guard, and as soon as they released their grip, I was overcome with a brilliant sidehead never seen before, collapsing to the ground as though bereft of the spirit of life. I felt as though I had been roused from the deepest sleep by the sound of my name being called. I added, here I am, I was enclosed. Despite the darkness, an aura was present. Then the darkest of voices called my name once more. Even though I could hear it, I could not identify who was speaking, or where the voice was coming from. The voice then addressed me, saying, Endupsa, descendant of Adapha, I have appointed you to be my scribe, that you record my words on the tablets. A light suddenly materialized in one area of the inclusion. A scribes table, a scribes stool, and beautifully formed stones were on the table, and the area was set up like a scribal workspace. However, I didn't see any clay tablets or pots with wet clay. Only one stylus was on the table, and it shone in the light like no other readstilers ever had. Endupsa, son of Aridu City, my faithful servant, the voice said once more, I am your lord, Enki, and I have asked you to record my words because I am deeply saddened by what the great calamity has brought upon humanity. To prove to gods and mortals that my hands are pure, I want a document the events precisely as they happen. Such a catastrophe had not before in the earth, the gods and the inhabitants since the great deluge. But the great deluge, not the great calamity would occur. This one would have been avoided seven years ago, it could have been avoided. Although I, Enki, did everything I could to stop it, I was unsuccessful. Furthermore, was it fate or destiny? It will be judged since there will be a day of judgment at the end of time. It will be the day of the re-entering celestial god when the earth will tremble, the rivers will shift their courses, and there will be darkness at noon and a fire in the heavens at night. On that day, it will be revealed who will survive and who will perish, who will be rewarded, and who will be punished. Gods and humans alike. For what will come to pass by what had passed shall be determined, and what was destined shall in a cycle be repeated. And what was destined and only by the hearts will occur for good or ill shall be for judgment come. The great Lord then resumed speaking, stating, I will reveal the correct narrative of the beginnings and of the prior times and of the olden times. For in the past, the future lies hidden. The voice suddenly went silent. I will talk for forty days and forty nights, and you will write during that time. Forty will be the total of those days and nights since forty is my sacred number among the gods. You must fast for forty days and forty nights, and consume bread and water once, which will be enough to keep you alive for the duration of your assignment. A glowing appeared in another area of the enclosure as the voice paused. I then noticed a table with a plate and a cup on it. I got up, and saw the bread and the cup of water on the plate. And upsa, eat the bread and drink the water, and you will be maintained for forty days and forty nights, the great Lord Enky's voice echo. And I followed the instructions. The light at the scribal table became more intense as the voice told me to sit there. I couldn't see any doors or openings where I was, yet the glowing was as bright as the midday sun. The voice asked, what do and ups are the scribe? I then stated, I see stone tablets and their colour is blue as pure as the sky, as I looked at the blazing beam on the table, the stones and the stylus. Then I noticed a stylus I had never seen before, with a read-like stem and an eagle-tallon-like tip. Stay true to what I've said and spoken, the voice said. These are the tablets on which you should write my words. They were cut to my specifications from the best lapis-lusselai, each having two smooth faces. Each stone tablet must have its front face inscribed, and its back must have two writing columns. The stylus you can see was also created by a god. It has a divine crystal tip and an electron handle. It will snuggly fit in your hand, and engraving with it will be as simple as marking wet clay. There was a pause and I touched one stone. The surface felt soft and smooth like smooth skin. I then took the holy stylus which was as light as a feather. The great deity Enky then spoke and I recorded his words verbatim in my writing. His voice was booming, occasionally approaching a whisper. His voice conveyed grief for agony as much as pride or joy. I took another tablet to continue after one had been written on all of its faces. The giant god paused when the ultimate words were pronounced and I heard a loud sigh. And he said, Endups are my servant. You have faithfully recorded my words for 40 days and 40 nights. This is where your job is done. Now take hold of a second tablet and write your attestation. As a witness, seal the tablet at the end. Take the tablet and place it with the other tablets in the divine chest. The chosen ones will arrive at a pre-determined time and discover the chest and the tablets. They will then learn everything I have dictated to you and an accurate account of the beginnings, the prior times, the olden times and the ages. It will be both a witness to the past and a foreteller of the future. For the first thing is also the last and a future lives in the past. After a brief pause, I placed the tablets inside the chest correctly. The chest outside was covered in gold inlay and constructed from a kishawood. My lord then spoke, telling me to fasten the chest's latch and close the cover and I followed the instructions. There are another silence my lord Enky said, and as for you and oopsah, you have spoken with a great deity and even though you haven't seen me, you have been in my presence. You are therefore my chosen spokesperson for the people you will become and I bless you. You must exhort them to do what is right since a good and long life is found in doing so. And it would be best if you can sold them because in 70 years the towns will be restored and the crops will resound. Warfare will coexist with times of calm. Kingdoms will rise and fall and new nations will grow powerful. The ancient gods will retire and the future will be decided by new gods. However, destiny will win out in the end and my remarks about the past foretell that future. And oopsah, you must inform the populace of all of it. After that there was stillness and as I and oopsah nelt in prayer, I questioned how I would know what to say. The words to speak will come to you in dreams and visions, the Lord Enky said. The signs will be in the heavens. There will be more prophets who have been chosen after you and in the end there will be no need for prophets because there will be a new earth and a new heaven. After the Oras disappeared and there was silence the ghost left me and I was on the planes outside of Eridu when I came to my senses. Summary of the more-hand collection of Cadian tablet, MC2894A, bewailing the emptiness of Summary. What happened when the radioactive cloud expanded and the gods left their cities? The discussions held at the gods council. The terrible choice to use weapons of terror. The beginnings of the gods and nibirus' incredible armaments, north-south wars, union and denastic rule on nibiru, the location of nibiru in the solar system. Summary changes brought on by a declining atmosphere. The attempt to get gold to protect the atmosphere fails. Alalu, a userpper, ignites volcanic gases with nuclear bombs. A denastic sessor named Anu overthrows Alalu. Alalu escapes nibiru by stealing a spacecraft. More-hand collection of Cadian tablet, MC2894A. The first-born son of Anu, Lord Enki, who rules over nibiru spoke these words. I cry lament with a heavy heart and bitterly laments flood my heart. How devastated is the country? How has the evil wind taken its people? How have the stables and sheepfolds been emptied? How severely has the evil wind affected the cities causing their inhabitants to pile up like dead bodies? How much has the evil wind affected the fields, leaving their greenery with it? How much are the rivers in love? The once pure beautiful waters have been poisoned and no one swims anymore. Summary is empty of its blackheaded inhabitants, all life has vanished. It is also empty of its cattle and lambs. The harm of milk-churning has gone silent. Only the wind hours in its gorgeous cities, the only odor is death. The temples whose gods race their heads to heaven have been forgotten. The septor and tiara are no longer present. No lordship or kingship command exists. The two big rivers previously lushened life-giving banks now only support weeds. My ways and roads are untraveled. Thriving Sumer is like an abandoned wasteland. How devastated is the country? The abode of men and gods. Unknown to man, a catastrophe struck the region. A catastrophe that humankind had never experienced before and was unstoppable. A disrupting hand of horror was laid upon all the regions from west to east. The gods were as helpless as men in their cities. The evil wind inflicted a great calamity in its path, a storm formed in a remote plane. A wind that brings death and travels from west-west has been faded to follow that path. A storm is as devastating as a deluge, destroying not with water but with wind, overwhelming not with tidal waves but with poisoned air. It was created by fate rather than destiny. The great gods had brought about the great calamity in their meeting. It was approved by Enlil and Ninhusag. I was the only one pleading for a halt. I fought day and night to accept the skies will but in vain. The warrior son of Enlil, Ninhuta and my son, Negal, poisoned weapons and let them lose across the vast plain. We were unaware that an evil wind would follow the brilliance. Now they sob in pain. Who could predict that the storm that brings death born in the west would make its way to the east? Now the gods lament. The gods in their sacred cities watched in disbelief as the evil wind travelled towards Sumer. The gods left their temples to the wind and one by one left their city. I was powerless to stop the poisonous cloud as it moved toward my city, Eridu. At a way to the vast step, I gave orders to the people. I left the city with Ninhu my wife. Enlil was powerless to halt it at his city of Nippur where the bond heaven earth was created. The evil wind was blowing against Nippur. Enlil hastily launched his celestial boat with his wife. Nana begged his father Enlil for help at Ur, the capital city of Sumer. Nana was the hand of fate and disregarded his father's pleas in the temple's location, which rises to heaven in seven steps. Turn the evil wind away, O great God who gave birth to me and gave the kingship to Ur. In a plea, Nana. Continue to honor the great deity who controls fortunes by sparing Ur and her inhabitants, Nana filed a protest. In the noble world, Ninhu will son, your excellent city lordship was granted, eternal reign was not, repired Enlil in response to his son, Nana. Ninhu will grab your wife and run from the city, even I who set the fates and powerless to change destiny. My brother Enlil said, but unfortunately it was not destiny. A tragedy that hasn't been this serious since the flood, gods and humans were hit. Sadly, it wasn't fate. The great deluge and the great calamity of the death-bealing storm were both predestined to occur. It was brought about by the breaking of a vow by a council vote and the deployment of weapons of terror. The poisoned weapons were released by choice rather than fate, and the lot was decided upon by thought. My first bond caused the immediate destruction of my two sons. The change was in their hearts for model. Marduk is not entitled to ascendancy. I will confront him with weapons, in order to say. Firstborn Enlil Yeld. He gathered an army of people using bubble-eyed to declare the center of year. So Yeld Nagal, Marduk's brother. In the big gods' meeting, poisonous phrases were said. My spoke up against haste day and night. Peace, I offered advice. Why does opposition persist when the populace has erected his divine image a second time? I begged the question. The age of Marduk in the sky has yet become. As each instrument been examined, I repeated my question. Ningesh Zidda, my own son and other heavenly indications are mentioned. I knew that his heart could not forgive Marduk for what he had done to him. Enlil on earthborn encountered Nana, who was also unyielding. Marduk established his own home during my time in the northern city. Then he said, the youngest son of Enlil Ishgur was sentenced to punishment and told to hoar after the people he had created in his domains. The two sons of Nana aimed his anger at Marduk's son Nabu and attempted to take control of the location of the celestial chariots. The identical twin of Utu inana was enraged and continued to demand that Marduk be punished for killing her beloved de Musi. Mother of the gods and humans, Ninhorsag, looked elsewhere. Why is Marduk not present? All she said was, Gibil, my own son, said sombili. Marduk has disregarded all pleadings and asserts his sovereignty based on signs from heaven. The only way to stop Marduk is with guns, Enlil's first born in Norte yelled. It was essential to Utu to keep Marduk's hands off the place of the celestial chariots, so it wouldn't crumble. Then he said, let the old weapons of terror for eradication be utilized, angrily commanded Nergal, Lord of the Lower Domain. I looked at my own son in astonishment, using fear weapons in brother against brother battles has been forbidden. There was silence rather than agreement. Enlil spoke quietly saying, punishment must be meted out. The evil doers shall be as burns without wingers. Marduk and Nabu are as of legacy at depriving. Let them of the place of the celestial chariots be deprived. Let the area be burned to a crisp. The one who scorches let me be, yelled Ninota. Excititely, Nergal jumped up and yelled. Let the towns of the evil doers likewise be demolished. Let me obliterate the cities of wickedness. Let the annihilator be my name after that. My family asserted that since Earthlings were our creation, neither the pious nor the sinful should perish. My co-creator, Ninhorsarga proved, saying, the issue is between the gods alone to settle, the people must not be hurt. Anu was paying close attention to the conversations and the celestial home. Anu, who controls destiny, spoke from his heavenly home. Let the weapons of terror be used this once. Let the place of the rocket ships be destroyed. Let the people be spared. Let Nergal be the annihilator and Ninhotah the scorcher be. Nel can curse as well and the choice was made public. I'll let them in on a god's secret and the location of the terror weapons. Nel called his two sons, mine and the other his, to his inner chamber. Nergal passed me without looking at me. A last brother has turned against brother. I shouted aloud without using words. Do the prior times have to happen again. Nel disclosed a myth from ancient times, trusting the weapons of terror to their hands. They are set loose, clad in dread and splendour, turning everything in their path into dust. They had vowed to fight each other as brothers on earth, regardless of the place. The oath was now rendered meaningless like a broken jar. The two sons came from Anlil's chamber with hasten steps, jumping with joy as the weapons left. Narn of his disasters had a foreshadowing, so the other gods turned around and went back to their cities. This is a description of earlier times and terrorist weapons. The beginning came before the prior times and the old times followed the prior times. The gods visited earth in ancient times and made the first humans there. No gods existed in the prior times and humans had not yet been created. The gods, home during the prior times, was on their own planet Nelbiru. Nelbiru is a giant planet with a reddish brilliance that orbits the sun in an extended orbit. Nelbiru spends some time in the cold, the sun strongly heats it for a portion of its orbit. Then Zappmospheric Nelbiru is continuously nourished by volcanic outbursts. This atmosphere supports many lives, without it there would be just perishing. The core heat of Nelbiru surrounds the globe throughout the cold season like an ever-rinewing warm cloak. It protects Nelbiru from the sun's harsh rays in the hot season. While it is raining, it holds and releases water to create lakes and streams. All kinds of life have sprung out in the waterways and on the land because of the lush vegetation that blankets our atmosphere, feeding and protecting it. After a long time, our species grew a seed that could keep going forever. As the number of a screw our ancestors moved to many parts of Nelbiru. Some worked for land and some with four legs to care of the animals. Some of them lived in the mountains and some of them lived in the valleys. Rival reasoning crotchments led to fights and sticks were used as weapons. Clans formed tribes and two big nations stood face to face. The country of the north took up arms against the country of the south. What was held by hand was turned into missiles that shot forward. Thunderers and bright weapons made things even scarier. The entire world was at war for a long time and brothers fought against brothers. Both north and south were affected by death and destruction. For a long time the land was empty and there wasn't much life. The land at truce was called and efforts to make peace were made. The messengers told each other, let the nations come together, let their be one thrown on Nibiru and one king who rules over everyone. Let a leader from the north or south be chosen by chance and let their be only one king. If he is from the north the south should choose a woman to be his wife and rule with him. If a south man is chosen by lot he should marry a north woman. Let them be husband and wife and become one flesh. Let their first-born son take over. Let this create a unified dynasty and bring peace to Nibiru for good. Peace began amid the wreckage. North and south were brought together by marriage. The royal throne became one body and a line of kings went on without a break. After peace the first king was an influential leader from the north. He was chosen by drawing lots. He was honest and fair and his decisions were respected. He built a beautiful city to live in. It was called Akad which means unity. Before his rule he was given the title Celestial One which meant he was a king. He brought law and order back to the land by force and made the rules and laws. He put governors in charge of each land. Their primary jobs were to restore and reclaim the land. In the royal records it was written that he united the lands and brought peace back to Nibiru. He built a new city, fixed the canals and fed the people so there was plenty of food on the land. He chose a young woman from the south to be his wife. She was known for both love and war. On to was her royal title and her given name cleverly meant the leader who is Ono's spouse. She had three boys and no girls with Ono. She gave her first son the name Onki which means a solid foundation in the language of Ono. He sat on the throne by himself and the choice of a wife was put off twice. The palace was filled with concibines during his rule but he never had a son. So the dynasty began with Onki's death since he had no children. Even though he wasn't the first one the middle son was named the legal heir. One of three brothers was called Lutunegal by his mother since he was a child. His name meant the one in the middle. From the royal records Onki is called. In divine kingship the name of the one who is Ono's son is shown through the generations. He was the third person to rule Nibiru. His father On was the second. He married the daughter of Anki's half-brother Nin called Lill the Lady of Lill. Oni bent Ninip had a son. He was the fourth king to take over the throne based on the number of kings. On Shah Ghal wanted to be known by his royal name which meant Ono's prince who is greatest of princes. His wife Kishar Ghal was his half-sister. They both had the same name. His primary goal was to learn and understand. He worked hard to learn how the heavens worked. He looked into Nibiru's big circle whose length had to be set at a shah. One year Oni Nibiru was used to track how long each king or queen ruled. He split the shah into ten parts and then announced two festivals. When the earth was closest to the sun, a festival of warmth was held. When Nibiru went to its far away home, the festival of coolness was set up. The two were set up to replace all the old festivals of tribes and nations and bring people together. He set up laws for husbands and wives and sons and daughters by decree. He also made the customs of the first tribes the law for the entire land. During the wars there were many more women than men. He made rules that said one male could have over one female. By law only one wife can be the official spouse. This wife is called the first wife to be called. By law the first one son took over for his father. By following these rules people soon needed clarification. If the first born son wasn't from the first wife then a son was born by the first wife who became the legal heir by law. Who will be the next leader? The one with the most first born children, the one who was born by the first wife. The youngest son, the heir by law, who will get the money, who will do well. While Anshagal was king, his shagal was named his first wife. She was the king's half sister. During Anshagal's rule the palace was once again filled with concubines. The king's sons and daughters were born to his concubines. The first child to be born was the son of a concubine. The child was called the first one. Then he shagal gave birth to a son. By law he was the heir but he was not the first born. In the palace he shagal got angry and yelled. Let the double seat not be forgotten if the rules say my son who was born to a first wife can't be king. Even though we have different moms the king and I have the same father. I am the king's half sister and he is my half brother. By that my son, our father, Unib's double seat, has it. The law of the seat and the law of marriage rule from now on. From now on a son by a half sister should take the throne before all other sons. Anshagal liked the law of the seat when he thought about it. It would keep his wife and concubines marriage and divorce from getting mixed up. In their meeting the king's advisors agreed on the law of the seat for succession. The scribes wrote the decree because the king told them to. So based on the law of the seat the name of the next king was made public. He was given the name Anshag which means king. He was fifth in line for the throne. This is the story of Anshag's rule and the kings who came after him. When the law was changed there was fighting among the other princes. There were words but there was no rebellion. His half sister and wife Anshag chose. He made her his first wife and gave her the name Kisha. So because of this law the dynasty kept going. During Anshag's rule the crops in the fields got smaller with fewer fruits and grains. From one circuit to the next their heat got more muscular as they got closer to the sun, while the colonists in the far away home got more biting. In Arkard the city of the throne, the king and many wise people got together. People with a lot of knowledge and intelligence were told to ask questions. They looked at the land and soil and tried out the lakes and streams. It happened before and some people said Nebiru had grown in the past when it was colder or warmer. It has a fate since it is part of the circuit of Nebiru. Others who knew the edge and watched the circuit did not think about Nebiru's destiny being to blame. They found that there had been a breaching in the atmosphere. Spitting up with volcanoes the atmosphere forebares and people who burped less. The heir on Nebiru has become less dense and the protective shield has shrunk. Nebiru's influence is spread during the rule of Unshar and Hisha and no amount of work could stop them. The throne was then taken over by their son, Nisha, who was the sixth member of that family. Lord of the Shah was what the name meant. He was born with a lot of knowledge and learned a lot throughout his life. He looked for ways to fix the problems like Nebiru's path through the heavens and he did a lot of research. It wrapped around five beautiful planets in its loop of the Sun's family. He had their atmospheres looked at, seeing if there were any ways to heal them. He gave each one a name. He honoured their ancestors and thought of them as he funnily couples. The first two planets he saw were on and on to like twins. Onshar and Kisha, the biggest ones were outside Nebiru's circle. Maga, among others, traveled as a messenger, sometimes meeting Nebiru first. As the sun went around, five heavenly beings created Nebiru. Beyond the Hammett bracelet, the sun made a circle like a boundary. The Hammett bracelet was like a guardian of heavens for bidding area, protecting it from chaos. The bracelet kept the four other children of the sun from getting hurt. Nisha set out to study how the five critters made people feel. In Nebiru's loop, five things were carefully looked at. What atmospheres they had were closely looked at by watching them and using celestial chariots. The findings were surprising and the discoveries were hard to understand. Nebiru's atmosphere breaching got worse from circuit to circuit. Then the councils of the wise, people talked about cures and waste the bandage wounds with great interest. A new shield was tried to cover the planet, but it all fell back to the ground. The volcanoes that spewed ash were looked at in councils of the wise. The atmosphere was created by volcanoes spewing ash into the air and it hurt when they stopped. Yet people devised new ways to burp and let volcanoes spew again, what once a vans group said. All the kings could only tell how the feet could be done or what tools could be used. During Anshar's rule, the whole in the sky got bigger. There were no rains, the winds were more potent and no springs were coming from the ground. There was a charge in the land that mothers breasts were dry. There was trouble in the palace and a charge spread. As his first wife he married his half-sister Enshar, which was against the law of the seed. There of the Shars, the lady was what people called Ninshar. Enshar had a son as a concaveine, the first one son. A son she didn't give birth to. Ninshar's first wife and half-sister didn't have a son. By the law of succession, the throne went to the Conquibine's son. He was the seventh person to rule. His royal name was Du-Uru, which means in the dwelling place made. He was born in the house of Conquibines, not in the palace. Du-Uru chose a young woman from his youth to be his wife. He chose the first wife because he loved her, not because she was his daughter. Du-Uru was her royal name, which meant she who is my sign. There was a lot of confusion in the royal court. Suns didn't get to inherit and wives weren't half-sisters. There was more and more suffering on the land. People became less fertile and the fields forgot how full they used to be. There was no birth in the palace. Neither a son nor a daughter was born. Never enough on children were kings and then none of his children were on the throne. A child named Dau-ru was founded the palace gate and the queen took him in as her son. In the end Du-Uru adopted him as a son and made him his legal heir. His name Larmou means dryness. The princes were complaining in the palace and there were also complaints in the council of councillors. In the end, Larmou took his place on the throne. Even though he wasn't on son, he was the eighth king. In the councils of the wise, there were two ideas for how to heal the brace. One had to use a metal-called gold. It was rare in Nibiru, but there was a lot in the Hammett bracelet. It was the only thing that could be ground into the finest powder and stay in the air high above heaven. Although with more supplies, the whole would close up and protection would improve. Let there be celestial boats and a staff fleet to bring gold to Nibiru. The other idea was to make weapons of terror that would make the ground shake and the mountains break apart. With missiles the volcanoes can be attacked, their slumber is broken, their belching made worse, the atmosphere filled up and the whole made to go away. Nibiru was too weak to choose, but he knew what to do. One time around Nibiru went around two shards. Nibiru was added to the list. In the fields things didn't get better. The atmosphere was not fixed by volcanic fires. A third shard went by and a fourth was added to the total. No gold was gained. There was a lot of fighting on the land, but there wasn't enough food or water. There was no longer unity in the land and accusations were everywhere. Intelligent people came from the Royal Court and councillors rushed in and out. The king didn't care what they said. He only wanted a device from his wife named Lahama. If it's fate she said, let's ask the great creator of all to help the king. The only hope is to beg on the internet. The princes at the Royal Court were upset and the king was accused of being stupid and irrational for making things worse instead of better. Weapons were taken out of the old storage places and there was a lot of talk about starting a rebellion. The first person to take up arms was a prince in the Royal Palace. By making promises he stirred up the other princes. His name was Allahlu. Lahama shouldn't be king anymore, he yelled. Let decisions supplant his attrition. Let scare the king where he lives. Let's leave his throne empty. The princes listened to what he said and ran to the palace gate. They went like rushing water to the throne room which had a small entrance. Allahlu was after the king who ran to the palace's tower. There was a fight in the tower and Lahama fell to death. No more Lahama, Allahlu called out. Allahlu ran to the throne room and sat on the throne as quickly as he could. He told everyone with joy that the king was dead. He made a king with no rights or counsel. Some people were content that Lahama had died while others were sat in by what Allahlu had done. This is the story of Allahlu becoming king and going to earn. There was no longer unity in the land and many people were upset with the king. Princes were upset in the palace and councillors were upset in the council. Anu's place on the throne was passed on from fathered son. Even Lahama with the 8th was called a son because he was adopted. Who was Allahlu? Was he a fast-born or a legal heir? How could he take over? Wasn't he the one who killed the king? Allahlu was brought before the Seffan who judged so that they could decide his fate. Allahlu made his pleas to the Seffan who judged. Even though he was neither a legal heir nor a fast-born son, he was of royal blood. Before the judges he said, I am from Anshagar. My ancestor was born to him by a concibine. His name was Allahum. My shahs count, Allahum was the first born, the throne belonged to him, but the queen used her cunning to take away his rights. She made a law of the seed out of nothing and her son became king. She took the kingship away from Allahlu and gave it to her son. I followed Allahlu's lineage, the seed of Anshagar is in me. The Seffan who judged paid attention to what Allahlu said. They took the matter to the council of councillors to find out if it was true. The royal records were carefully read from the House of Records. Anul and AnTu were the first king and queens. They had three sons but no daughters. Anki was the first born. He died on the throne and had no children. In his place the middle son took the throne. His name was Anip. Anshagar was his first child and his throne. After him the first born did not stay on the throne. The law of succession by the law of the seed was replaced by a new law. The first born was the son of a concaveine but the law said he didn't have the right to be king. Instead he shagal son became king. This was because she was a half-sister of the king. The first born the son of the concaveine was not written down in the history books. Of him I am descended, Allahlu cried out to the councillors. By the law of succession he was the rightful king. By the law of succession I am now the rightful king. The councillors of Allahlu hesitated before taking the truth oath that was asked of them. Allahlu took the oath of life and death and as king he thought about what the council had to say. They called the elders and the princes together and the decision was made before them. A young prince stood up from the group of princes. He had something to say about being king. He told the assembly that succession needs to be looked at again. Even though I wasn't the first born or the queen's son I came from pure seed. The essence of Arne is still in me and no concaveine has changed that. The words shocked the councillors and they told the young prince to come closer. They asked what he was called. It's Anu. I was named after my grandfather An. When they asked about his family tree he told them about An's three sons. Anke was An's first born but he died without a son or daughter. Anke was the middle son. He took the throne instead of Anke. He married Anke who was the daughter of his younger brother. From that point on the succession is written down in the history books. Who was that younger brother? One of the pureest seed and the son of Anand Antu? The councillors just looked at each other in shock. His name was Anuku Anu told them. He was my great-great-grandfather. His wife Nenuru was his half-sister and her first-born son was named in Nama. Anke and succession laws said that his wife was his half-sister and she gave him a son. By law and seed the generations kept coming from the same family. My parents named me Anu after our grandfather An. We have been kicked off the throne but were not kicked off. An's pure seed let Alalu be removed, let Anu be king, a lot of councillors yelled. Let others gave advice. Let there be no fighting and let unity win. They called Alalu to tell him what they had found. Alalu put his arm around Prince Anu and spoke to him in this way. Even though we have different parents, we both come from the same ancestor. Let's live in peace and help Nibiru return to plenty together. Let me keep the throne and you take care of the next king. He said to the council, let Anu be crowned Prince, let his son marry my daughter and let the airs unite, let him be my successor. Anu bent down in front of the council. He said the following to the group. I will be Alalu's cupbera and his heir apparent. As his bride he will choose a son of mine or a daughter of his. It was the council's decision written down in the royal records. In this way Alalu stayed seated on the throne. He called on the wise people geniuses and commanders. He consulted and learned a lot that helped him decide. He permitted boats from the heavens to be built to find the gold in the Hammond Brislet. The boats were crushed by the Hammond Brislet and none returned. Let the weapons of Terrabi used to cut open Nibiru and let the volcanoes erupt again. He then gave an order. With weapons of Terrabi chariots in the sky were loaded with terremisiles and fired from the sky at volcanoes. The mountains moved as bright light and thunder exploded and the valley shook. There was a lot of happiness in the land and there were hopes for plenty. Anul was in the palace for Alalu who was in charge for cups. He would bow at Alalu's feet and give Alalu the cup to drink from. Alalu was the king and Anul worked for him as a servant. There was less joy in the land, the rain stopped and the winds got more robust. The amount of gas that volcanoes blew out didn't get worse and the hole in the atmosphere didn't get fixed. Nibiru's circuits kept going around in the sky. It got harder to handle the heat and cold from circuit's circuit. The people of Nibiru stopped respecting their king because he made things worse for them instead of better. Alalu stayed in his seat on a throne. The most powerful and wise prince Anul was standing before him. He would bow to Alalu's feet and give Alalu the cup to drink from. Alalu was the king of Nibiru for nine times that were measured. In the ninth shah, Alalu and Anul fought. Alalu challenged him to fight hand-to-hand with no clothes on. Anul said, let the winner be king. They fought in the public square. Dorposts and walls shook as they did so. Alalu bent his knee and fell on his chest of the ground. Alalu was defeated in battle and Anul was hailed as king and taken to the palace. However, Alalu did not return to the palace. He sneaked away from the crowds because he feared doing what Alalu did. He quickly went to where the celestial chariot's were but no one knew. Alalu got into a chariot that could shoot missiles and shut the door behind him. He went into the front chamber and sat in the commandous chair. That which shows the way he filled the chamber with the blueish glow. He woke up the fire stones and their humming sound was mesmerizing. He brought to life the chariot's great cracker which was shining with a reddish light. Alalu from Nibiru got away in the celestial boat without anyone else knowing. Alalu was set his cause for a snowy hour. He chose his destination from the start by keeping it a secret. What the second part of this acadean tablet mc2894 a says. Alalu's flight in a spacecraft that had nuclear weapons. He heads for the seventh planet he, Earth, why he thinks gold will be on Earth. The history of the solar system, the water and the gold of Tiuma. The first time Nibiru was seen from space. The battle of the gods and the breakup of Tiuma. Earth half of Tiuma gets her water and gold. Kingu, Tiuma's giant satellite becomes Earth's moon. Nibiru will continuously circle the sun. When Alalu came to Earth and touched down. When Alalu finds gold, Nibiru's fate is in his hands. The reverse side of more hen collection acadean tablet mc2894 a. Alalu set his cause for snowy Earth but kept his destination a secret. Alalu went to off limit places. No one had been there before and no one at the Hammard bracelet had tried to cross that. A secret from the start, Alalu's path has shown. It put the fate of Nibiru in his hands and he devised a plan to make his kingship universal. He had to go into exile on Nibiru but he risked death. In his plan, the risk was in the journey and the reward was the eternal glory of success. Alalu looked at the heavens while flying like an eagle. Down below, Nibiru was a ball hanging in space. Its shape was beautiful and its light lit up the sky. It was a considerable size and when it burped, fire shot out. Its red life-giving envelope was like a churning sea. The break was clear like a dark wound in the middle of it. When he looked down again, the large hole had become a small tub. When he looked again, Nibiru's bright ball had become a small fruit. The next time he looked, Nibiru was gone from the vast dark sea. Alalu's heart was filled with regret and fear held him by the hands. He made a choice to wait. Alalu thought about stopping in his tracks, then he went back from being brave to make a decision. The chariot went 100 leagues, then a thousand leagues, and then 10 thousand leagues. Darkness was the darkest in the vast heavens and the eyes of the stars far away were blinking. Alalu travelled more leagues and then he saw something that made him very happy. In the vastness of the heavens, he was greeted by the messenger of the gods. Little Gaga, the one who shows the way, was welcomed by Alalu as he went around the circle. Before and after the celestial unto, it would move with an uneven gate. It could face forward or backward because it had two faces. Alalu once thought that its first appearance was a good sign. He is welcomed by the gods of the sky, so was what he thought. Alalu wrote his chariot along Gaga's path which led to the second god of the heavens. Soon after King Enshar gave it the name Celestial Antu. It was getting dark in the deep. She was as blue as clean water and the beginning of the upper waters. Alalu was amazed by how beautiful the scene was, so he kept the safe distance from the course. In the far distance, Antu's wife, Shimid, she was the same size as Antu. His wife's double, An, was known for being a greenish blue. On its side, a dazzling host surrounded it and they were given solid grounds. Alalu said goodby to the two gods with love, but Gaga's path was still unclear. It was showing its old master for whom it used to be a counselor how the course was changing for Anshar, the highest priest of the heavens. By the speeding chariot, Alalu could see how Anshar was pulling him in. The chariot was beautiful with bright rings of colours. Equically turned his eyes away from Alalu and toward that which shows the way. He saw the family's bright star in the faraway heavens, which was very unusual. After a terrifying sight, the truth came out. A giant monster following its destiny cast a darkening shadow on the sun. Its creator Kishar ate it up. The event was scary and Alalu thought it was a bad sign. It was too big for the giant kishar who was the leader of the firm planet. Storm sweltered around it, hiding its face and coloured spots moved around on it. The guard in the sky was surrounded by so many people that it was impossible to count them all. Their ways were hard to deal with and they kept going back and forth. A spell was cast on Kishar sending out divine lightning bolts. As Alalu watched, his path got off track. His direction was unclear and his actions needed to be clarified. Then the deep darkness disappeared and Kishar continued on his destiny to the circuit. As it slowly moved, the sun's light lifted its veil revealing the one from the beginning. Joy in Alalu's heart was not long lasting. He knew that beyond the fifth planet was the most dangerous place. The Hammett bracelet was in charge. It was waiting to be broken. It was made by hammering together rocks and boulders. The rocks worked together like orphans without a mother. They went back and forth following an old plan. Their actions were disgusting and their ways were hard to understand. Nibiru's probing chariots ate them up like hungry lions. The valuable gold that was needed to stay alive. They didn't want to move. Alalu's chariot was going full speed toward the Hammett bracelet. The fierce boulders had to be briefly faced in close combat. Alalu stirred up the firestones in his chariot even more and he drove that which shows the way with steady hands. The scary boulders next to the chariot moved forward like an enemy coming to attack. Alalu fired a death-bealing missile at them from the chariot. Then he fired another terror weapon at the enemy. As scared warriors, the boulders turned around making way for Alalu. The Hammett bracelet is like a spell that opens the door to the king. Even though Alalu was very deep and dark, the heavens were easy to see. He was not defeated by the bracelet's power. His mission did not end. In the distance, the sun's fiery ball which was also its brilliance was sending out rays of light toward Alalu. Before it was a reddish brown planet making its way around, it was the sixth of the gods of the sky. Alalu could only catch a glimpse of it as it moved quickly away from his path. The seventh object in the sky was the snow-colored earth. Alalu set his course toward the planet and it was a very inviting place. Its catchy ball was more petite than nibiru and its catchy net was weaker than nibiru. It had a thinner atmosphere than nibiru and clouds were swirling. Below, the earth is broken up into three regions. Snow white on top and bottom with blue and brown in the middle. Alalu's skillfully put the chariot's wings around the earth's ball to make a circle. In the middle, you could see both dry land and watery oceans. I have reached my goal. He told the insides of earth to pick up on the beam that went straight down. He shouted with excitement. Gold, a lot of gold was shown by the beam. It was under a dark area and in the water as well. With his heart racing, Alalu decided to think about, will he crash and die if he let's his chariot fall on the dry land? Should he go straight into the water where he might sink into a blifian? How will he stay alive? Will he discover valuable gold? Alalu was not moving an eagle's seat and he gave the chariot to faint. The chariot moved faster because it was fully caught in the earth's net. Its spread wings lit up. The air around earth was like enough. Then the chariot started to shake making a terrible thunder sound. The chariot crashed suddenly and all of a sudden it stopped. Alalu couldn't move because the shaking and crash had made him lose his mind. Then he opened his eyes and saw that he was still alive. He had won and made it to the planet of gold. Now, here's what we know about the earth and its gold. It tells about the beginning of time and how the gods in the sky made the world. When it all started in the above there were no gods in the heavens and in the below key there was no name for the firm ground. Absoled their first leader was all alone in the void. In the heights of the above there were no celestial gods yet and in the depths of the below there were no celestial gods either. Above and below were no gods yet and no one knew what would happen. No reads at Gr\u00f6nje and there was no marshland. Absol ruled the void all by himself. Then his winds mixed the waters of the beginning and absolute cast the divine and clever spell over the waters. He slept soundly in the deep of the void. Teammat, the mother of everything became his wife. She, indeed, was a mother from heaven and a watery beauty. Absol's little mumud then gave birth next to him and he gave Teammat a gift to bring to him as his messenger. Only she can have a gleaming metal gold that lasts forever. Absol gave this beautiful gift to his wife. Then their waters mixed and they had divine children to bring into the world. The celestial's were created in both male and female forms, Lamu and Lahamu were there given names. Absol and Teammat constructed a house below. Anshar and Kishaw were created in the waters of the above when they were older and taller. They were taller than their older brothers. The two were created to be a celestial couple and they had a sun named on in the far away he was there sion. Then, on to was brought out, it was on's equal and would be his wife. Their house was built on the outskirts of the upper waters. This is how below and above three heavenly couples were created in the depths. They were known as Absol's family because Mumu and Teammat were among them. Nibiru had yet to be seen. The earth had to be created first. The holy waters had become entangled and even a hammered bracelet couldn't separate them. Not all of the circuits had been completed. The fates of the gods had yet to be determined. The celestial's got together but they did strange things. Teammat was upset and angry because she couldn t sleep on their journey to Absol. She gathered a large crowd to march alongside her. She gave birth to a people who roared and fought against Absol's sons. She had eleven of these babies. She made Kingu the group s first born and leader. When the gods of the sky learned about it, they convened a council meeting. She promoted Kingu to the rank of an on and gave him the order. They exchanged words. She placed a tablet of destiny on his chest, completing his circuit. She told her son Kingu to fight the gods, but who would stand up to Teammat each guard inquired of the other. No one from their group stepped forward and no one was going into battle with a weapon. In the midst of the deep, a god was born. He was born in a location known as the Chamber of Fates. He was created by an artist and was the son son. The god quickly abandoned his family in the deep where he was born. He brought the seat of life a gift from his creator. He set his sights on the void. He was looking for a new direction in his life. Onto was always on the lookout and was the first to spark the wandering celestial. His body was appealing and he shone. His walk was wrinkle and the way he moved was magnificent. He was the most powerful of all the gods and his circle was more extensive than theirs. Onto was the first to notice him even though her child had never sucked at her breast. Come join my family, allow me to become your mother. She mentioned his name. She cast her net and made him feel at ease. His path was appropriate for the job. Her words made the newcomer proud and her caring about him made him arrogant. His hair doubled in size and four things sprouted from his sides. He moved his lips in agreement and a holy fire began to burn from them. He turned to face Onto about the show on his face. When on saw him he exclaimed, my son, my son. You will be responsible for something and a host will be your son. Let your name be Nibiru because crossing will be remembered forever. When Nibiru passed by, he bowed to him and turned his back. He cast his net for Nibiru's four servants and caught them. His hosts are the south wind, north wind, fast wind and west wind. With a joyful heart, Onto told his ancestor Onshar about Nibiru. When Onshar's messenger Gaga heard this, he sent words of wisdom to On to assign a task to Nibiru's people. He told Gaga to say what was on his mind. That Tiamat, the woman who gave birth to us, now despises us. She has organized a group of people who want to fight and she is furious. Her 11 warriors and children fight alongside her against the guards. She piled Kingu on top of them and scribbled a fate on his chest for no apparent reason. No guard can withstand her poison. She has made us all fear her. Allowing Nibiru to become our assailant. Let him defeat Tiamat and save our lives. Decide what will happen to him and then let him face our formidable foe. He went to Gaga. He bowed before him and repeated Onshar's words. He told Nibiru what his ancestor said and what Gaga sent to him. Nibiru was taken aback by the words. Based on what he had heard, he imagined the mother whose children would eat her alive. He addressed On and Gaga. Without saying anything, his heart told him to go fight Tiamat. He stated, if I am to defeat Tiamat and save your lives, I must gather the gods and declare that my destiny is supreme. Let all the gods agree in counsel that I should be in charge and that they should obey my commands. When Lammu and Lahammu heard this, they cried out in agony. The request was strange and no one knew what it meant. The fate deciding gods communicated with one another, so they informed me. They were all in agreement that Nibiru would be their Avenger and that he would have a wonderful life. Nobody will be able to argue with your rules from now on. None of us gods will go beyond your boundaries, they told him. Nibiru, go be our Avenger. They carved out a princely path for him to take the Tiamat. They blessed Nibiru and bestowed upon him powerful weapons. On Shah also brought the evil wind, the well wind and the matchless wind from Nibiru. Shah's body was engulfed in flames and he held a net around Tiamat. As a result, Nibiru set a direct course for Tiamat and prepared for battle. Now, let's look at what happened during the celestial battle. How the earth got its lead and what will happen to Nibiru. The Lord went out and did his assigned task. He turned to face the raging Tiamat and cast the spell. He put on the pulsar and the emitter to protect himself. His crowned head glued with a terrifying light. The smiter was on his right and the repello was on his lap. Like a storm, he sent out his seffon helpers, the winds. He dashed toward Tiamat who was enraged and yelling for a fight. The gods surrounded him, but they did not follow him. He was going forward to get a better look at Tiamat and her entourage. The plan devised by King the leader of her host. He lost his sense of direction, got off track and didn't know what to do when he saw brave King. Tiamat's group was completely surrounded and they trembled in terror. Tiamat shook down to her roots and let out a mighty roar. She cast a spell and surrounded him with her charms on Nibiru. They both agreed on something and the fight began. Tiamat and Nibiru came face to face and moved in opposite directions. As the battle approached, they decided to fight on their own. The Lord spread his net and threw it in an attempt to catch her. Tiamat screamed like she was insane in rage. She had gone insane. Nibiru pushed the evil wind from behind him in front of her and let it go. She attempted to swallow the evil wind but could not close her mouth. The evil wind struck her in the stomach and entered her body. Her stomach was rumbling, her body was swollen and her mouth was open wide. Nibiru pierced the hole with a sharp arrow of divine lightning. It entered her body through her stomach. It shattered. It tore into her womb and broke her heart. He took her last breath now that he had her under control. Nibiru examined Tiamat's lifeless body which resembled a dead animal. The 11 employees of their deceased employer trembled in horror. They were caught in Nibiru's net and were unable to escape. Tiamat made Kingu the gang's leader so he was one of them. He was chained and teared to his dead mistress by the Lord. He took the tablets of destiny from Kingu which he found repulsive. He signed the destine and tied it to his chest. The rest of Tiamat's troop became prisoners in his web. He trodden them, breaking them up into small bins. He connected them to his circuit and led them back to the cost to turn around. Nibiru then fled the area where the combat had taken place to the gods who sent him to inform them of their victory. Nibiru passed on and onto on his way to the abode in the deep. He circled up so visiting Kishar and Anshar along the way. He proceeded to tell the others after Gagang came out to greet him. He next considered what would happen to Tiamat who was no longer alive and Kingu. Lord Nibiru returned to Tiamat whom he had tamed. He found her, glance at her dead body and then walked away. A deception was devised to divide the monster in his heart. Then, like a muscle, he split her chest and lowered torso into two halves. When the Lord trodden her back side, he severed her top half. He cut open her in a channels and marveled at her golden veins. He summoned the north wind his ally from his side. He instructed them to place the seffit head of the wind in the empty area. Then he beeru wind then passed over Tiamat sweeping over her raging waves. Nibiru fired a lightning bolt at north wind. He transmitted a message and Tiamat's head was taken away in a blaze of light to an unknown location. Kingu was also sent away with her and the portion that had been seffit was to be his friend. Nibiru then considered what would happen to the back part. He wanted it to be a combat trophy that would survive it, certainly. The battleground to be enshrined serves as a permanent reminder. He used his maest to sefer the horse's back. They then strung them all together to form a hammered bracelet. He secured them as watchmen by locking them together. A firmament to keep the waters separate from the waters. Nibiru has created beautiful works of art by separating the upper waters above the firmament from the lower waters. The lord then crossed the heavens to examine the area, taking measurements from up-sous quarters to gargers dwelling. He then stared at the deep Nibiru's rim and his birthplace. He paused for a moment to reflect before returning to the battleground the firmament. He resented traveling through absu's country and remembering the sun's departed spouts. He focused his attention on Tiamat's wounded side and her upper body. Her treasure from the wounds, the life fluids continued to flow. The rays of the sun were reflected in her golden veins. Then Nibiru realized his creators' birthright, the seed of life. He gave Tiamat the seed when he crushed and tore her apart. With your warm beams you can heal the injured, it all up-sous. Give the broken part new life in your family as your future daughter. Gather the rivers in one place and let the stable ground rise. Firm land. Please call her key from now on. Upsu listened carefully when Nibiru stated, let the earth join my family key, firm land of the below, let earth be her name from now on. Upsu said, allow her to remain there by turning. I will provide her with healing rays throughout the day. Allow Kinglu to be a creature of the night and I will make him the moon for all time, earth's friend. Nibiru upsu's words were heard with delight. He studied the areas as he flew to the heavens. He bestowed permanent positions on the gods who raised him. None of their circuits were designed to be broken nor to fall short of each other. He strengthened the heavenly locks and gates on both his established sides. He chose an outermost residence that was sized beyond Gaga. He pleaded with Upsu to declare that the grand circuit would be his destiny. Every deity called out from their thrones, let Nibiru's power be surpassed, let the sun sun indeed be the brightest of the gods. Before leaving his apartments, Upsu gave his approval. Nibiru, whose name means crossing, will preside over the union of heaven and earth. The gods will not pass through anything above or below him. He will occupy the center and serve as the gods' shepherd. His circuit will always be one char, that is his destiny. This is the narrative of how the olden times began, as well as the period known as the golden era in the annals, and how expeditions from Nibiru were dispatched to earth to acquire gold. It all started with a lalu's flight from Nibiru. A lalu infused much of what he had learned with extraordinary insight. His forefather, Anshagal gathered excellent knowledge about the heavens and circuits. Anshar significantly improved their knowledge. A lalu received considerable knowledge from it. He talked with intelligent men and sought guidance from savants and commanders. A lalu had this knowledge because he had studied about the beginning. The gold on the Hammond Bracelet served as confirmation. The gold in Tiamat's Hammond Bracelet was the indicator. With thundering claps, a lalu triumphantly landed on the planet of gold in a chariot. He used a beam to scan the surroundings for his whereabouts. A lalu, a chariot came down to earth and landed on the edge of a vast marsh. He changed into a fish suit and an eagle helmet. He then unlocked chariot's hatch, hazing to consider. Their heavens were blue-white and the earth was dark. There was silence and no one to greet him. He stood alone in a strange world, perhaps from Nibiru, exiled forever. He lowered himself to the ground and tried on the dark colored earth. Hills in the distance could be seen and many forests nearby. He stepped into one of the wetlands in front of him. He trembled as he felt the chill of the marshes waters. He returned to solid ground and found himself alone in an unfamiliar world. He was ceased with thoughts, aching for his bride and children. Had he been exiled from Nibiru forever, he couldn't stop wondering about it. He quickly returned to the chariot with food and drink to keep himself alive. Then thanks to profound sleep, he awoke from a deep nap. He couldn't remember how long he'd slept or wanted woken him up. Outside there was a dazzling light and an unseen glow on Nibiru. He took a test-to-requipped pole from the chariot. It consumed a planet's air, proving its compatibility. After opening the chariot's hatch, he inhaled deeply. He inhaled again, then another, then another. The air in key was suitable. Alalu clasped his hands and sang a happy tune. He perished without a fish suit or an eagle helmet. The sun's rays were blinding and the brightness outside was overwhelming. He returned to the chariot with an eye mask. He took up the sword he was carrying and the expensive sampler. He was on the dark coloured earth where he had stepped. He made his way toward the marshes whose water was a dark greenish. Alalu took a pebble from the swamp's edge and tossed it into the area. As he moved across the marsh, he noticed the fish-filled streams below. He lowered the sampler into the swamp and considered the filthy waters. Alalu was devastated to find that the water was unsafe to drink. He pulled a U-turn and went for the hills away from the marshes. As he proceeded through the foliage, he passed through shrubs and trees. Because of the number of fruit-bearing plants, he airy-a-resempled and orchid. As the pleasant perfume of the fruit enticed Alalu, he placed it on his lips. The sweeter the flavour, the more delicious the fragrance. Alalu was delighted with joy. Alalu was walking away from the sun's rays to what the hills he had chosen. He felt moisture under his feet among the branches, indicating the presence of water nearby. He planned his route toward the dampness. There was a still pool of water and a pond in the woods. He lowered the sampler into the pond since it was safe to drink. Alalu couldn't stop himself from laughing. There was fruit and fish and the water was drinkable. Alalu knelt, cuck\u0442 his hands together and drew water to his mouth. The water became cold and the water from Nibiru had a distinct flavour. He drank again, then split in two, terrifying. He heard a hissing sound and saw a writhing body alongside the pool. He grabbed his weapon and fired a flash of light to water the hissing. Both the moving and hissing stopped. Alalu approached the threat to examine it. Nibiru's sight has never been seen, but the bizarre sight of the lifeless creature with its slithered body lying in mobile and lacking any hands or feet was that of a rope. It was a creature from another world. It's little head was ornamented with fierce eyes and a lengthy tongue protrude from its mouth. Alalu reflected on himself. Was it the orchard's keeper? Was it the water's master? He doubted himself. He was carrying water in his flask and moving while keeping a lookout for the chariot. He also gathered some excellent fruits before setting off for the chariot. When he arrived at the chariot, the sun's brightness had faded and darkness had taken its place. Alalu was taken aback by how short the day had been. An astonishing lightness was developing on the horizon from the direction of the marshes. A bright white all was rapidly rising in the sky. He had now seen Kingu Earth's mate. The planets and their circuits, the hammered bracelet, he, the Earth and Kingu its moon, were constructed and named. Alalu felt that beholding demanded one more truth. The secret to salvation rested in the gold to be discovered. If the stories from the beginning are true and Tiamat's golden veins were indeed swept away by the waves, the cut off half of gold must be discovered in key. With shaking hands, Alalu the tester disassembled the chariot's pole. As they eagerly anticipated the approaching daybreak, the fish's outfit was put on with trembling hands. He walked out of the chariot and onto the marshes at first light. He waited the tester deeper into the waters he had introduced. As his heart thumped in his chest, he attentively examined its illuminated visage. The testers showed its findings in the waters composition, represented by symbols and numbers. There is gold in the seas the tester said and Alalu's heart stopped. He lowered the tester back into the water and the gold tester announced once more. Alalu took a step forward, wobbly on his legs, before continuing into the marshes. Nebiru's destiny is now in my hands, declared Alalu proudly. He returned to the chariot, removed the fish disguise and took his seat as commander. The tablets of destinies are aware of all the circuits. He connected to Nebiru's circuit to decide the direction. He summoned the speaker of words to deliver the words to Nebiru. Then he spoke the words of Nebiru. He was described as follows. In his words the greater Lalu addresses Anu-1 Nebiru. In another world, I discovered the gold of salvation. Nebiru's future is in my control. You must heed my requests. A synopsis of more-hand collection Babylonian tablet, MC17494B. Anil Anu's first son suggests on-site verification. Alalu sends the message to Nebiru and reclaims the throne. Anu taken a back puts the subject to the royal council. Aya Anu's first born and Alalu's son-in-law is instead chosen. Aya skillfully equips the heavenly boat for the journey. The spacecraft's pilot Anzu is carrying 50 heroes. Despite the perils, the Nebiruans exult at the site of earth. They splashed down and weighed ashore guided by Alalu. Aya Rido, home away from home, is established in seven days. The extraction of gold from the canals begins. Despite the small amount, Nebiru needs the delivery of Abgol, a pilot who chooses Alalu's spaceship for the mission. Inside the spaceship, there are illicit nuclear weapons. Aya and Abgol remove and hide the terror weapons. There are three tablets. Nebiru's future is in my control. You must heed my requests. Alalu spoke the words projecting them from Nebiru to the dark tinted earth. When the monarch Anu got the messages from Alalu he was shocked as were the wise men and councillors. They asked each other questions. Is Alalu still alive and well? Could he be from another planet? They were speaking in a skeptical tone. Wasn't he fleeing in the chariot to a safe haven on Nebiru? The chariot commanders were summoned and the beamed words were considered. The words were spoken from outside the Hammard bracelet, not from Nebiru. They discovered this and told King Anu about it. Anu was taken aback and had no idea what had transpired. Let words of acknowledgement to Alalu be delivered to the gathered, he said. At the place of the celestial chariots, Alalu was given the following orders. Anu the King wishes his congratulations and expresses his joy upon knowing about your health. There was no reason for you to leave Nebiru because Anu has no ill will against you. Alau Nebiru to be saved if you have discovered the gold of salvation. When Anu Alalu's chariot spoke, Alalu reacted immediately. If I am to be your savior, I will save your lives. Gather the princes. My ancestry reveals itself to be supreme. Alau the commanders to choose me as their commander and submit to my power. Alau the council to appoint me as ruler, assuming Anu's throne. When people heard Alalu's claims regarding Nebiru, they were outraged. Councilers interrogated one another. Anu was deposed in what way. What is the condition of his asylum? Did he really find gold? What if Alalu's mischief conveys the story rather than the truth? They sought the wisdom and council of the wise and knowledgeable. I was Alalu's master, said the oldest first, he was speaking. He had listened to the beginnings in instructions and the celestial battle lessons he was learning. If he had gone beyond the Hammard bracelet, he would have known of the aquatic monster Tiamat and her golden veins. He is safe sanctuary as the seventh planet from earth. Before the assembly, a prince addressed the subject claiming to be Anu's son and the son of Anu's wife on to. Anu's name means Lord of the Command. He was issuing warnings. Alalu is definitely silent when discussing circumstances. He ricked havoc, losing the throne in a single wrestling match. If Tiamat's gold had been discovered, the proof was necessary. Would it be sufficient to protect our environment? How is it transported to Nebiru via the Hammard bracelet? Anu's son spoke in this manner and many other questions were asked. Even though many responses and proof were required, everyone agreed. Alalu had received the assembly's message and he needed to respond. Alalu weighed the importance of his statements and chose to divulge his secrets. He recounted his voyage and its perils. He extracted the testers' crystal internal organs and the samplers' crystal heart. The crystals and other discoveries were then placed in the speaker for broadcast. Declare Me King and Abayi My orders now that the proof has been revealed. He made a strong demand. The sages were stunned. He demolished the bracelet with weapons of terror and unleashed even more havoc on Nebiru with Alalu. As Nebiru circles that region, tragedies accumulate in Alalu. The king shipped to be changed was a serious matter and there was much concern in the council. Anu was king not only because of his ancestors but also because of fair warfare. Anu's son spoke in front of the assembled princes. He was one of the sages recognized for his all-in-compassing wisdom. He was known as Enki. He whose home is water and he was a master of the secrets of the waterways. He was Anu's first born and married Domkina Alalu's daughter. Anu the king is my biological father but Aia claims Alalu is my stepfather. My fiancee's purpose was to bring the two clans together. Let me be the one to bring peace to this battle. Alalu made a represent Anu to Alalu and defend Alalu's discoveries. Let me arrive on earth in a chariot. I will dig a water-only path through the bracelet. According to the sages assessment, Alalu should reign as earth's monarch. Let there be a second wrestling bout and if Nebiru can save, who will rule. Alalu to make a decision. Let me retrieve the valuable gold from earth's rivers and return it to Nebiru. The princes' advisors, sages and commanders were ready for the struggle they had discovered as they listened in a basement way as words. Alalu had to happen. Alalu aya to travel and the gold to be examined, Anu stated. I'll fight Alalu once more, made a victor reign as Nebiru's monarch. Alalu received the ruling's words. After thinking, he welcomed Aya, his son by marriage to earth. Collecting gold from the seas put it to the test for Nebiru's salvation and decide whether Anu or I shall rule the second wrestling throne. Okay then, Anu presided over the gathering. Anu will protest it, but the king's word was final. When he arrived at the chariot location, he sought the council of commanders and wise men. He considered the risks of the venture and the difficulties of mining and transporting the gold. He carefully analyzed Alalu's transmission and requested additional testing to obtain the necessary answers. He was making a tablet of destinies for himself. If water is the source of the force, whens can it be replenished? How will it be stored on the chariot and how will it be converted into force? In meditations, a full circle of Nebiru and a char of Nebiru were finished. The mission's most massive heavenly chariot has been outfitted. A tablet of destiny has been firmly fixed and the destiny of its circuit has been computed. 50 heroes are required for the journey to earth to collect the riches. His approval was given for Anu's journey and the stargases were picked when the expedition was ready to begin. Many people flock to the place of the chariot to bid farewell to the heroes and their leader. Did the soldiers enter the chariot one at a time each wearing an eagle's helmet and carrying a fish suit? Aia was the last the depart for ship and sacred by to the others. He bowed before his father Anu to win the king's blessing. My first born, my son. You've come a long way, putting us all in danger. Please let Nebiru's catastrophe pass you by so you can safely return. Before saying his parting farewell, Anu blessed his son. Ninole, Aia's mother, embraced him from the bottom of her heart. Why did you give him a restless heart after Anu gave me you as a son? Return safely across the perilous path, she spoke to him. Aia kissed Dhamkina his wife without saying anything. Anu illent his half-brother were holding hands. He wished him prosperity and good fortune. Now that the journey to the seventh planet has been narrated, the narrative of the fish god who rose from the sea may begin. Aia, the chariot, arrived with a heavy heart to carry out his orders. Anzu drove the chariot, not Aia and Anzu sat in the commander's seat. His name meant he who knows the heavens and he was picked specifically for the position. He was a prince among princes, claiming royal ancestry. He skillfully steered the celestial chariot as it rose forcefully toward the distant sun guided by Nebiru. Chariot travelled ten leagues, one hundred leagues and one thousand leagues. They were welcomed by Little Gaga who was also greeting the heroes. It gave blue tinted guidance the charming enchantous Anzu. Anzu was drawn in by her appearance. Let's explore her oceans. Anzu is speaking. It's a world with no turning back Aia said emphatically, continuing to talk without hesitating. The chariot continued its journey toward the solar systems third planet. His moons entourage was twirling around him while Anzu lay next to him. Water was evident in the testors' beams indicating where Aia should stop if necessary. Aia proclaimed he would lead the way to Anshar, the highest prince of heaven to continue the journey. They quickly became conscious of Anshar's magnetic pull, appreciating his ring of terrors' various colours. Anzu, the chariot guide, definitely avoided the lethal threats. The massive Kishar was the second definite planet discovered. Her net had a strong pull, but Anzu, the chariot reversed direction with incredible skill. Kishar thrusts in wrath at the flashes of the holy lightning chariot, her host thrusting at the unwanted. Kishar steadily retreated in preparation for the chariot, which was waiting beyond the fifth planet for the Hammett Bracelet. The water thruster was instructed to prepare so that his labour of love might begin to spin. The chariot was hurtling toward a swarm of whirling boulders, each one hurling itself at the chariot like a slingshot stone. When Aia gave the word, a water stream with the force of a thousand heroes was launched. As they formed a path for the chariot, the boulders faced each other one by one. However, as one boulder fled, another attacked in its place. They were a veritable army, a host for Tiamat's vindictive splitting. Aia repeatedly told the water thruster to keep spinning, repeatedly directed streams of water at the swarm of stones, repeatedly made the boulders face his alter, allowing the chariot to pass. The chariot could proceed without incident once the path was clear. The heroes let out a joyous yell, which was heightened by the emergence of the sun. Amid Anzu's excitement the alert went off. For the way to having fashioned, excessive waters were eaten. Waters were insufficient to keep the chariot's flaming stones hydrated for the rest of the journey. They could see the sun's rays reflected in the sixth planet's profound darkness. He was asking for Anzu. Enki is assisting Larmu who has water. Do you want to ride the clown chariot over there? Anzu, the chariot, maneuvered it definitely toward Larmu, reaching the celestial guard and forming a circle around it. Anzu believes that the planet's attraction is too easy to handle, and that its network could be more robust. Larmu was a sight to behold, it was multi-coloured with pure white stones and head gear. It had a reddish center surrounded by dazzling streams and lakes. The chariot, highlighted by Anzu, paused traffic and plummeted alongside a lake. While wearing their eagles' helmets, air and Anzu strayed to the solid ground. At the command, the heroes that which water sucks expanded the chariot filling its interior with lake water. While the chariot drank its fill of water, air and Anzu inspected the place. Tester and Sampler uncovered everything that mattered. The waters were okay to drink, but the air was insufficient. All of this was recorded in the chronicles of the chariot, and the cause for the diversion was explained. After regaining Vigga, the chariot ascended to compassionate Larmu's farewell solidation. Beyond the seventh planet was circling, Earth and its companion, the chariot were calling. In the commandous chair, Anzu and Air remained mute. They were on their way to discovering whether Nibiru would offer them salvation or damnation. A chariot must be slowed or it will perish in Earth's dense atmosphere, Anzu informed air. Make leisurely circles around the moon, Earth's friend, he was proposed to buy air. They circled the moon, prostrate and scarred by the celestial battles destroyed Nibiru. As a result, the chariot slowed as it reached Anzu, the seventh planet. He drew the chariot in a circle twice the size of the earth, and then gradually drew it closer to the firm land. The planet was two-thirds snow-colored with a black center. They could see the firm lands and oceans while looking for the signal beacon from Alalu. Alalu's signal was sent whenever an ocean met the dry ground, and the wetlands absorbed four rivers. Because it was so vast and heavy, the chariot belongs in the marshes, Anzu made a remark. Because the earth's tugging net is too strong, the dry ground cannot descend, Anzu informed air. Splashed down, splashed into the waves of the ocean, air to Anzu screamed. Anzu drove his chariot around the earth one more time before carefully lowering it to the water's edge. The chariot's lungs expanded as air entered them. It splashed into the water below, but did not sink. A voice from the speaker said, welcome to earth. Alalu took the floor, his beaming statements pointed in the direction of his whereabouts. The chariot was moving through the river in the direction Anzu the chariot indicated. Soon, the vast sea began to close in, and dry ground appeared on both sides as a protector. On the suitable highlands, brown-hewed hills rose to the left, their heads pointed to heaven. The chariot floating like a ship on the waters made its way to Alalu's place. The marshes ahead were replaced by the oceans as the dryland was swamped. In response to the hero's orders, Anzu ordered their fish suits. The heroes entered the marshes via the chariot's hatch. Strong ropes were connected to the chariot and used to pull it. Alalu's beaming statements became more powerful. Harry, Harry, this is what he stated. At the marsh's edge, there was a sight to behold. Alalu's sacred vessel, Nibiru, was riding in a chariot that gleamed in a sunlight. The hero accelerated his movement toward Alalu's chariot. They accelerated. Air put on his fish suit out of impatience. His chest felt like it was pounding like a drum. He jumped into the swamp and dashed toward the edge. The bottom was more profound than he expected, and the marshes flooded the vast hines. He changed his pace to that of a swimmer, propelling himself ahead with powerful strokes. He could see verdant pastures as he approached dryland. He rose up and began walking once his feet touched solid ground. Alalu stood in front of him, throwing his hands wildly. Air emerged from the sea and stood on the dark surface of the earth. Alalu dashed in his direction and embraced his son through marriage tightly. Welcome to a new world, Alalu spoke to Air. This describes how Eredu came to be on earth and how the seven-day count began. Alalu, Air held hands in silence. His eyes were welling up with ecstasy tears. Air bowed in front of him in respect for his father whom he had married. The heroes were making their way through the marshes while others were running toward the dry ground while closed in fish suits. Don't let the chariot go down, avoid the dirt ahead by anchoring it in the water. Anzu was in command. The heroes landed in front of Alalu. They were working on bows. Anzu, the last chariot to leave, arrived. He bowed before Alalu and the two exchanged greetings. All visitors were greeted warmly by Alalu. Everyone in the room heard air's instruction. I am Earth's commander. This is what he stated. We have arrived on a life-ordered mission. Nebiru's future is in our hands. He looked about for a probable spot for his planned encampment. There are mounds in the soil. Air issued the order to set up a camp. He was pointing to a nearby reed hut home erected by Alalu. To the king my father, Anu, herald your triumphant arrival. He said De Nibiru before saying to Anzu. As it turned, the hue of the heavens changed from dazzling to Scarlet. They were watching something unprecedented. The sun was disappearing like a red ball on the horizon. Fear incapacitated the heroes of the great calamity. They were terrified. A lowering of the sun, it is indicating the end of one day on Earth. Alalu says as he laughs. Lay down for a quick snooze. Anite on Earth is short. The sun will appear before you know it and it will be morning on Earth. The heavens and the earth separated as darkness descended abruptly. Lightning strikes pierced the darkness and it rained and funded. Winds like storms from an other worldly god blew across the ocean. Within the chariot the heroes assembled, they were upset since they had not gotten any sleep. With baited breath we awaited the return of the sun. When its rays appeared they giggled and slapped each other on the back. Their first day on Earth included both an evening and a morning. By daylight air had already considered the occurrences. He was considering how to divide the oceans. Angor fashioned the master from the beautiful waters to provide drinking water. He walked to the snake pond with Alalu thinking about its warm waters. Nasty snakes were spreading in the pond. Angor informed air of this. Air then reflected on a large amount of rainfall he had collected in the marshlands. He named the Reed Thicket he was directing and delegated wetland maintenance to Enby Lulu. Enkidu was in charge of the ditch and dike constructed a boundary so that the marshes could create a collection area for the rainwater. As a result, marsh waters and pleasant waters were separated from the waters above and below. The second day on Earth occurred between the hours of dusk and dawn. As soon as suned on was declared the hero accomplished the chores assigned to him. Alalu airs steps were aimed toward the grass and trees area. Herbs and fruits of various kinds grow on everything in the orchard. Air posed the following inquiries to his vizier Isimood. What exactly is this plant? What exactly is that plant? He was curious. Isimood, a learned man, could tell what food grew well. He ripped a fruit from a honey plant for air. In his remarks to air, he ate one fruit and ate one fruit. The hero, the guru, is given power over the food that grows due to his excellent reputation. As a result, the hero was given drinking nourishment, but he was unsatisfied. The third day on Earth occurred between the hours of dusk and dawn. The winds died down on the fourth day and the waves had never effect on the chariot, allowing the chariot's tools to be brought and the encampments dwellings to be built. This was given by air. In charge of mold and brick making, cooler assigned air to make clay bricks and give mushdammu the order to build foundations and dwellings. The sun shone all day brightly, generating the day's brightness. By sunset, Kingle, one of the heavenly gods, was supposed to represent the Earth's moon, which casts a pale light on Earth and elicolite to rule the night when it is complete. It was the fourth day on Earth, late at night and early in the morning. On the sixth day, airening yeesig gave the order to build a readboat. It is critical to assess the extent of the swamplands and the distance between the marshes. We'll mush the one who knows what swarms in the oceans and who amid the birds that saw. Enki relied on Ulmasht to help him distinguish between good and evil. The Ulmasht were unaware of many creatures that swam in the oceans and take flight in the air. Their sheer numbers were astounding. The carp were large and swimming among the undesirables. Air summoned Envi Lulu, master of the marshlands, Enki Mduw, commander of the ditch and dying. He spoke to them in the marshlands to build a barrier, catching fish with the help of cane breaks and green reads, a trap for carp that could not escape from a net was set up there. No bird suitable for consumption could escape from its net. For the heroes given, fish and Ultri were separated into gorgeous varieties. It was now the morning after the sixth day on Earth had ended. On the sixth day, each of the orchards creatures began keeping score. Ennoa sang the his task of distinguishing between what creeps and what walks on foot. Their personalities left Ennoa sang stunned and he told air about the ferocity of their wildness. Mushdarmur was summoned by Air Cooler, who issued the following urgent orders. Their houses will be completed by the evening and a fence will surround them for security. The warriors who took up the assignments quickly laid bricks on the foundations. The roofing was made of reads while the fencing was made of felt trees. A beam that kills from the chariot carried over a speaker that words beams to the house he made for air on zo. Everything air allolo and on zo did was positive in light of their acts. The camp was completed by the evening. The heroes gathered for the evening. The sixth day has night time and morning hours. On the seventh day, the heroes of the encampment gathered. They overheard air declared to them, we have taken a risky dangerous road from Nibiru to the seventh planet. We landed on earth, did much good and established an encampment. Today should be a day of relaxation and the seventh day should always be a day of rest. The phrase Eredu should now be replaced with home in the far away, which means the same thing. To fulfill a vow declare a lalu of Eredu as commander. The assembled heroes ward their approval in unison. Before paying respect to air, a lalu said the following words for agreement. Give air a new nickname, Nudimood, the artful fashioner. The hero all not it in agreement. The seventh day has night time and morning hours. This is the narrative of how the gold search began and how Nibiru's plans to save itself fell miserably. After Eredu's tent had been erected and the heroes had eaten enough to satisfy them, air gold was gathered from the canals. The chariots' fire stones were stirred as was its great cracker. With that which water sucks from the chariot expanded, it was immersed in marsh waters. Water was directed into a crystal jar. The water draws out all the metal in the jar, including the crystals. The water was then spat out of the vessel and into the fish pond, where the metals in the water were collected. Air was a talented tailor and his creations were fantastic. Marsh waters were pulled in and spewed for six days on earth as metals accumulated inside the vessel. Air and allalu studied the metals on the seventh day. The metals in the jar varied. There was plenty of copper and iron but gold was scarce. In the chariot was another vessel, another work of art by Nudimood. After being split into numerous categories, the metals were delivered ashore one by one. As a result, the heroes must work for six days straight before taking a day off. Over six days, the crystal balls were filled and emptied. On the seventh day, metals were counted. There were also copper, iron and other metals and the gold was collected in the most miniature mound. During the night, the moon waxed and wane. The months made its circuit call. It declared the seventh day a day of rest by its half crown when the months began as its six days of sparkling horns signified. The moon was seen halfway through its fullness after that its shrank. The moon's orbit aligned with the sun's path revealing the earth's face. The moon's motions captivated air, he's attachment to kingu. He pondered, what was the purpose of the attachment and what divine sign did it convey? Month referred to air as the moon's circuit and month named its circuit. The rivers separated in the chariot for a month and two months. The sun gave earth a new season every six months. Air named winter and summer. Winter and summer existed. By the year of earth, air had completed the circuit. By the end of the year, the accumulated gold account had been taken. There should have been more to send to Nibiru. The Swamplands waters were insufficient. Transport the chariot to the more bottomless unfathomable sea. Air had already stated this. The chariot was unmoored and returned to its original place. The saltwater was circulated through the stirred up crystal jars with care. Metals were classified into numerous categories and gold shone brightly among them. Air received word of the events from the chariot and sent it to Nibiru where Anu was overjoyed. Nibiru was on its way to the sun's dwelling and was getting closer to earth on its char circuit. Anu inquired equally about the gold. Was he asking, have enough arrived to send to Nibiru. Unfortunately, more of the gold from the waters was needed. Let another chargo by and double the amount. Air gave advice to Anu. Obtaining gold from the ocean's waters continued. Anki felt apprehension filling his heart. Parts were hauled from the chariot and a sky chamber was assembled. Obgol, he who knows the pilot of the sky chamber to pick charge he appointed. Daily in the sky chamber with Obgol did air upward saw, the earth and its secrets to learn. For the sky chamber an enclosure was constructed by a lalu's chariot was it placed. Daily the crystals in a lalu's chariot did air study. What by their beams was discovered to understand. Whenst as the gold come, he asked the lalu, where on earth are teamots golden veins. In the sky chamber with Obgol did air upward saw, the earth and its secrets to learn. Over majestic mountains they roam, in the valleys great rivers they saw steps and forests below were stretched and thousands of leagues were within reach. Vastlands separated by oceans they recorded, with the beam that scans the soils they penetrated. On Nibiru, impatience was growing. Was the outcry increasing? Can gold protection provide? Assemble the gold, on Nibiru's bearing gold you must deliver. So did Anul Aya's command. Repair a lalu's chariot for returning to Nibiru, make it fit and prepare it for the shars completion. So was Anul saying. Aya, his father's the king's words were heeding. He contemplated repairing a lalu's chariot. As the sky chamber one heave by the side of the chariot they landed. With Obgol the chariot they entered a secret deed in the darkness to perform. The weapons of terror, the seven of them, from the chariot they removed. To the sky chamber they took them inside the sky chamber to give them hiding. My sunrise Aya with Obgol in the sky chamber saw to another land was their direction. There in a secret place did Aya the weapons hide. In a cave a place unknown he stored them. Then to Anul Aya words of command Aya to repair a lalu's chariot he directed. For returning to Nibiru to make it fit by the shars completion to make it ready. Anzu in the ways of chariot is exceptionally skilled in the task his labors set. He made its thrusters hum again, its tablets he contemplated. The absence of the weapons of terror he soon discovered. With Anga Anzu cried out. Aya of their hiding away explained. For swan is the weapons use Aya was saying. Neither in the heavens nor on firm lands shall they ever be honnest. Without them no passage through the Hamid bracelet is safe. Without them, without water thrusters the danger is endurance surpassing. Anzu is speaking. A lalu of Aya do the commander the words of Aya considered. To the words of Anzu he he gave. The words of Aya by the council of Nibiru are attested. A lalu was saying. But without the chariot's return Nibiru shall be doomed. Abgol who knows to pilot boldly to what the leader stepped forward. Aya shall be the pilot. The dangers Aya shall valiantly face he was speaking. Thus was the decision made. Abgol shall be the pilot and Anzu on earth shall stay. On Nibiru the stargases the destinies of the celestial gods contemplated. An abatune day they were selecting. Into a lalu's chariot basketfuls of gold were carried. The four part of the chariot Abgol entered the commander's seat he occupied. From the chariot of Anki to him Anki's tablet of destiny gave. Shalbee that which shows the way for you. By the open pathway you shall find. The chariot's firestones Abgol stirred up. Their humlike music was enthralling. He enlivened the chariot's great cracker. A reddish brilliance it was casting. Anki and Aya lalu, the multitude of heroes, were standing around saying farewell to him. They were bidding. Then the chariot with a roar heaven would rose to the heavens it ascended. Two Nibiru words of the Ascent were beam. There was much expected of Nibiru. Synopsis of the fourth tablet. The Nibirians hailed even the small gold delivery tests of gold's use as an atmospheric shield succeed. Additional heroes and new equipment are sent to earth. Gold extraction from the water continued to disappoint. Aya discovers gold sources that need deep mining in the Abgol. Anil then Anul comes to earth for crucial decisions. As the half-quarral brothers lost the sighted tasks Aya renamed Anki, Earth's master, goes to the Abgol. Anil stays to develop permanent facilities in the edit. As Anil prepares to lease, he is attacked by a lalu. The seven who judge sentence a lalu to exile on lammu. Anil's daughter Ninma, a medical officer, is sent to earth. Stopping off at lammu, Mars, she finds a lalu dead. A rock carved a resemble a lalu's face serves as his tomb. Anzou is given command of a waste station on lammu. Reverse side partly damaged, more hand-claction a Syrian tablet, Mosul M.C.1265M. Two Nibiru words of the Ascent were beam. There was much expected of Nibiru. With confidence, Abgol, the chariot guiding, around Kinghu, the moon, he made a circuit by its net power speed gain. A thousand leagues, ten thousand leagues to Ward Lammu, he journeyed. Through its net power, a direction toward Nibiru to obtain. Beyond Lammu, the Hammard bracelet was whirling. Definitely did Abgol A. as crystals make a glow, the opened paths to locate. The eve of fate upon him with favour looked. Beyond the bracelet, the chariot beam signals from Nibiru receiving, Homward, Homward was the direction. A head in the darkness, a reddish hue glowed Nibiru, a sight to behold. By the beam signals, the chariot was now directed. Thrice around Nibiru, it made circuits by its net force to be slowed. Nering the planet, the breach in its atmosphere, Abgol could see. He felt a squeezing in his heart of the gold he was bringing. What was he thinking? Passing through the atmosphere's thickness, a glow was the chariot, its heat overbearing. Definitely did Abgol spread the chariot's wings, its descent arresting. Beyond Latha place of chariots, a sight most inviting. Gently did Abgol the chariot bring down to a place by the beam selected. He opened the hatch, a multitude of the populace was there assembled. Anu toward him stepped forward, locked arms, warm greetings at it. Heroes into the chariot rushed, the gold bearing baskets they brought out. High above their heads the baskets held. To the assembled words of victory Anu shouted. Salvation is here to them he was saying. To the palace was Abgol accompanied to rest and tell all he was escorted. The gold, a sight most bustling by the savants was quickly taken. To make of it the finest dust to skyward launch it was hauled away. A char did the fashioning last and a char did the testing continue. With rockets was the dust heaven would carried by crystal's beams was it dispersed. Where there was a breach now there was a healing. Joy the palace filled and abundance in the land was expected. To earth Anu's good words were beaming. Gold gives salvation. The obtaining of gold continues. When Nibiru near the sun came the golden dust was by its raised stern. The healing in the atmosphere dwindled and the breach to witness returned. Anu the return of Abgol to earth then commanded. In the chariot more heroes travelled. In its bowels more that which the water sucks in and thrusts out were provided. With them no gold the travel was commanded. A pilot helper to Abgol to become. Great joy there was when Abgol to Eridu returned. Many greetings and the locking of arms there. The new water-working's air with air contemplated. There was smiling on his face. In his heart there was a squeezing. By Shah's time Nungol in the chariot was the depart ready. The chariot had only a few baskets of gold in its bowels. The disappointment in Nibiru ayes heart to him was predicted. Anki with Alalu words exchanged that which was known they reconsidered. If earth the head of Teermot was in the celestial battle cut off where was the neck. Where were the golden veins cut a thunder? Where were the golden veins from earth's in its protruding? In the sky chamber, Anki over mountains and valleys travel. The lands by ocean separated him with the scanner examined. Again and again there was the same sign. Where dry land from dry land apart was torn, earth's inads were revealed. Where the landmass with the shape of a heart was given in the lower part thereof, golden veins from earth's inads were abundant. Abzu of gold the birthplace air to the region the name gave. Air then to Anul words of wisdom beamed. With gold earth is filled, the gold must be gotten from the veins not the waters. From earth's bowels not from its waters must the gold be obtained. From a region beyond the ocean, Abzu it shall be called can an abundance of gold be gotten. In the palace there was great astonishment, savants and councillors to air's words gave consideration. That gold must be obtained on that unanimity there was. How to obtain it from the bouts of the earth have that there was much disgust. In the assembly a prince spoke up. Anul was the half-brother of air. First alalu then his sun by marriage, air upon waters placed all hope. Of salvation by water's gold they were reassuring, Shahar after Shahar, all of us salvation were expecting. Now different words we are hearing are tasked beyond imagining to undertake proof of the golden veins is needed and a plan for success must be ensured. So was Anul to the assembly saying. To his words many in agreement listened. Let Anul go to earth. Anul was saying. Let him proof obtain a plan but forward. His words shall be heated. His words are command shall be. In unanimity the assembly consented and Anul's mission was approved. With alalu algar his chief lieutenant Anul for earth departed, alalu algar his pilot was with each a sky-chain bird the two of them provided. To earth Anul the king and words of decisions were beamed. Anul of the mission in command shall be. His words shall be the command. When Anul on earth arrives air and his half-brother warmly lock arms, as brother meets brother air Anul is welcomed. To alalu Anul made a bowing, alalu with weak words paid welcome. The heroes to Anul's words of warm welcome were shouting at the commander, much as they were expecting. Definitely Anul the sky-chain birds to be assembled did command. In a sky-chain bird he went sauring. Alalu algar his chief lieutenant was the pilot with him. Anki in a sky-chain bird by abgaw piloted to them to the observs showed the way. They surveyed the drylands of the oceans they took careful notice. From the upper sea to the lower sea the lands they scanned, all above and below they took account. In the abzu the soil they tested, gold there was true with much soil and rocks it was co-mixed. Refined as in the waters it was not. In an admixture it was hiding. They went back to endo, what they had found they contemplated. Eridoo new tasks must be given, alone on earth it cannot continue. Thus was Anul saying. A grand plan he described, a comprehensive mission he was posing. More heroes to bring over, more settlements to establish. The gold from earths in its to obtain and the gold from the admixture to separate by sky ships and chariots to be carried from landing places for tasks to perform. Who of the settlements in charge will be and who of the abzu shall take command? Thus was Aear of Inlil asking. Who of enlarged Eridoo shall take command and who the settlement shall oversee? Thus was Alalu saying. Who of the sky ships and the landing place shall take command? So did Anzu inquire. Let Anul come to earth, let him decisions provide. Thus did Anul say in Ansa. Now this is the account of how Anul went to earth came. How lots with Anki and Anul were drawn, how Anki the title name Anki was given, how Alalu for the second time with Anul wrestled. Two earth in a celestial chariot made Anus Jenny, the route by the planets it followed. Around Larmou, Nungal, the pilot a circuit made by Anus studied. They circled and admired the moon, who Kingu once had been. Perchans gold thereon can also be found in his heart on a wondered. In the waters beside the marshlands his chariot splash down. Anki for the arrival read boats prepared for Anul to arrive by sailing. Above the sky, chambers were hovering, a royal welcome they were offering. In the lead boat Anki was afloat, the king, his father, the first to be greeting. Before Anul he bound, then Anul embraced him. My son, my first one, Anul to him shouted. In the square of Eredu, in rose the heroes, they're king to earth wily to welcome. In front of them stood and lill that commander. Before Anul the king he bound. Anul him to his chest embraced. Anul too was their standing, of what to do he was uncertain. Anul too him a greeting extended. Letters lock Anus' comrades to Anul he said. With hesitation Anul stepped forward with Anul, he locked Anus. Anul for Anul was prepared. By Eve time, a read-hut for him by Anki was built. Anul retired. The next day the seventh by the count began by Anki was a day of resting. A day of back slapping and celebrating it was as befitted the king's coming. On the day that followed Anki and Anul before Anul the findings presented. What was done and what was needed with him they discussed. Let me see the lands by myself Anul to them was saying. Aloft they all in the sky chambers went, lands from sea to sea they observed. To the abzu they flew and on its gold-hiding soil they landed. Complex will the gold's extraction be Anul was saying. To obtain the gold it is necessary no matter how deep the gold is below the surface it must be gotten. Let Anki and Anul tools for the purpose device. Let them heroes for the task assigned. Let them find how gold from soil and rock separates. How nibiru is pure gold to deliver. Let a landing-place be built and let more heroes to the tasks on earth be assigned. So was Anul to the two sons saying in his heart of waste stations in the heavens he was thinking. Those were the command words of Anul. Anki and Anul in agreement their heads were bowing. There were evenings and mornings to Eridu they all returned. In Eridu they held council tasks and duties to assign. Anki, who Eridu established was the first to speak up. Eridu have I established. Let other settlements in this region be set up. Let the edin be a bowed of the upright ones by this name be known. The commander of the edin let me be. Let Anul the gold extraction perform. My these words and little was angered. The plan is wrongful to Anul he said. Of commanding and tasks to perform I am the better. Of skyships I have the knowledge. Of the earth and its secrets my half brother Anki is the never. The abzu he discovered. Let him of the abzu be the master. Anul listened to the angry words with a careful ear. The brothers were again half brothers. The first born with the legal air with words as weapons were contending. Anki was the first born son of a concubine to Anul. He was born Anul after that born by Anul. Anul spouse was conceived. A half sister of Anul she was Anul. The legal air making the next born son for the succession the first born overcoming. A conflict that the abtayement of gold would endanger Anul was fearing. One brother to nibiru must return. The succession from considering must now be removed. So was Anul to himself thinking. Allowed to the two a startling suggestion he made. Who to nibiru for the throne seat shall return? Who the edin shall command? Who in the abzu shall be the master? Let us three I wish you by lots determined. Silent with the brothers. The audacious words by surprise them over took. Let us draw lots on Usain. By the hand of fate let their be a decision. The three father and two sons clasped their hands together. They cast lots and by the lots the tasks they divided. Anul to nibiru to return its ruler on the throne to remain. The edin to endlil was allotted to be the lord of the command as his name showed. More settlements to establish of the skyships and their heroes charged to take. Of all the lands until the bar of the season counter the leader is to be. To Anki the seas and the oceans as his command were granted. Lands beyond the bar of the waters by him to be governed. In the abzu to be the master with ingenuity the gold to procure. Anil with the lots was agreeable. The hand of fate he with a bow accepted. Anki's eyes filled with tears of Eridu and edin. He wished not to be parted. Let Anki forever Eridu as his home keep. Anul to Anil was saying. Let his being the first to splash down forever be remembered. Let Er has Anki's master be known. Anki Anki's master let his title be. His father's words and little with the bow accepted. To his brother he thus said, Anki Earth's master your title name shall henceforth be. I lord of the command shall be known. The decisions were announced to the heroes in the assembly, Anul, Anki and Anil. The tasks are assigned and successes in the offering. Anul to them was saying. Now I can bid you farewell to Nebiru with a quiet heart I can return. Forward toward Anul alalu stepped. A grave matter has been forgotten he shouted. The mastery of Earth to me was a lot it. That was the promise when the gold finds the Nebiru I announced. Nor have I the claim to Nebiru's throne for Saken, by Anul to share all with his sons it is a grave abomination. Last did alalu Anul and the decision challenge. Without words was Anul in the beginning then with Ange he spoke up. By second wrestling let out his bute be decided. Let us do the wrestling here. Let us do it now. With this day in alalu took off his clothing. Likewise did Anul one robe. Innegid nested the two royals grapple, a mighty struggle. Alalu bent his knee and to the ground alalu fell. Anul on the chest of alalu with his foot pressed down victory in the wrestling declaring. By wrestling the decision was made. I am the king to Nebiru alalu shall not return. So was Anul saying as he removed his foot from the fallen alalu. Up as lightning alalu from the ground rose, by the legs Anul pulled down. His mouth was wide open and swiftly he the male hood of Anul bit off. The male hood of Anul did alalu swallow. In pain agony did Anul cry to the heavens shout to the ground wounded he fell. Anki to the fallen onul rushed. Anul the laughing alalu captive held. Heroes onul to his bute carried words of accusation against alalu he uttered. Let justice be done. With your beam weapon let alalu be killed and little to his lieutenant shouted. No, no, Anki fiercely shouted. Justice is within him. In his innards poison has entered. They took alalu to a read-up. His hands and feet has a prison abound. Now this is the account of the judging of alalu. And of the happenings after that on earth and on lammu. In his read-heart Anul was hurt him. In the read-heart to him, Anki applied the healing. In his read-heart alalu was sitting, spittle he spat from his mouth. In his inads the male hood of Anul was like a burden. With Anul's seaman were his inads impregnated. Like a female in Treveil is belly grew swollen. On the third day Anul's pain subsided. His pride significantly hurt. To nibiru I wish to return to his two sons did Anul say. Before hand upon alalu there must be a judgment, a sentence the crime befitting must be imposed. By the laws of nibiru's seven judges were required, the highest rank of them to preside. In the aridu square the heroes assembled the trial of alalu to observe. Seven seats were provided for the seven who judge. For Anul presiding the tallest seat was prepared. Two his right Anki was seated. Anul was seated on on his left. On Anki's right Anzu and Nungol was seated. Abgal and alalu got to the left of Anul's hand. Before the seven who judge alalu was brought his hands and feet were untied. Anul was first speak. In fairness a wrestling match was held and alalu the king shipped to Anul forfited. What say you alalu? Anki him this question asked. In fairness the wrestling match was held and I lost the king ship alalu's saying. Having been vanquished alalu an abominable crime performed the male hood of Anul he bit and swallowed. The asked did Anul the accusation of the crime make. Thereth is the punishment Anul was saying. What say you alalu? Anki is farther by marriage asked. There was silence. Alalu the question did not answer. We all the crime did witness alagawa saying. Judgment must be in accordance. If words he wished to utter speak before the judging. Anki to alalu's saying. In the silence alalu slowly spoke. On Nibiru I was king by right of succession I was raining. Anul was my cupbera. The princes he aroused to a wrestling heme challenged. For nine counted circuits I was king on Nibiru. To my seat kingship was belonging. On my throne seat Anul himself sat. To escape death to distant earth I made a dangerous journey. Salvation for Nibiru I alalu on the alien planet discovered. Returned to Nibiru I was promised in fairness the throne to regain. Then to earth came Anki the one by compromise the next terrain Nibiru he was designated. Then came Enlil the succession from Anul to himself claiming. Then Anul came and by lots he tricked Anki. Anki the lord of earth was proclaimed. A earth not of Nibiru to be the master. Then to Enlil the command was granted and Anki to the distant abzu was delegated. My heart of all that was aching my chest from shame and anger was bursting. Then Anul is foot upon my chest placed upon my aching heart he was trading. In the silence Anusboka by royal seat and law by fair wrestling did I gain the throne. My malehood you bit off and swallowed my offspring line to discontinue. Anil's bow cup. To the crime the accused admitted let the judgment come. Let death the punishment be. death said a loga death said abgol death said nonga death to a lalu by itself will come. What he had swallowed in his innards death will bring. Anki was saying. Let a lalu be in prison for the rest of his days on earth. Anzu is speaking. There words Anul was contemplating. Anger and pity both he engulfed. The die in exile let this be the judgment Anusboka saying. Inamasement the judge is at each other glanced. What Anusboka saying they wondered. Neither on earth nor on Nibiru shall the exiling be Anusboka saying. On the way there is the lalu planet with waters and anapasphereities in down. Anki as Anki thereon made a pause. Of it as a waste station have I been thinking. It's net forces less than earth's force for. An advantage in wisdom to be considered. In the celestial chariot a lalu shall be taken. On my departing from earth he with me shall make the journey. Around the planet lammu we shall make suckits to a lalu a sky chamber we shall provide. To the planet lammu in it he will be descended. A loon on a strange planet an exile he shall be. His days to his last day by himself to count. Last did Anus words of judgment utter in solemnity with the words intended. By unanimity was this judgment upon a lalu imposed. In the presence of the heroes it was announced. Let Nungar be my pilot in Ibiru. From that place chariot's bearing heroes again to earth to pilot. Take charge, so did Anus' commandment utter. Let Anzu join us for the journey of the descent plammu. On the morrow departing was ready. All who depart by boats to the chariot were ferried. A place for landings on firm soil you must prepare, Anu to Enlil was saving. How lammu was a waste station to use plans you should make. Fair wells there were, both joy and sorrow. Limping did Anu on the chariot in bark and with his hands tied did a lalu the chariot entered. Then the chariot sought to the heavens and the royal visit ended. They around the moon made a circuit. Anu was enchanted by sight. To ward Redhude Lammu they journeyed, twice about it they circled. Lower toward the strange planet they came, mountain sky high and tears on the surface they noticed. They observed where Enkis chariot had once landed, while Lake sight it was located. Sloed by lammu net power they readyed in the chariot the sky chamber. Anzu its pilot then unexpected words to Anu. With a lalu to the firm soil of lammu I shall descend, with the sky chamber to the chariot to return I wish not. I shall stay with a lalu on the strange planet until he dies I shall protect him. When he dies of his inner poison has befitts a king, he might shall bury. I shall have made my name. Anzu they will say against all odds to a king in exile a companion was. He saw things by others unseen on a strange planet he faced strange things. Anzu they will to the end of time shall say as a hero has fallen. There were tears in the eyes of a lalu and amazement in the heart of Anu. Your wish shall be honored Anzu Anzu. Anzu said, At this moment let a promise by me to you be made. By my raised hand to you I this swear. On the next journey a chariot by lammu shall suck it. It's sky ship to you shall descend. If alive it shall find you the master of lammu you shall be proclaimed. Anzu about his head. When a wastage on lammu shall be established it's commander you shall be. Okay then to Anu he said. Into the sky chamber a lalu and Anzu were ushered. Eagles helmets and fish suits provided them with food and tools. From the circling chariot the sky ship departed. Its descent was observed from the chariot. Then from view it disappeared and the chariot's tunabiru continued. For nine shahs was a lalu king on nibiru. For eight shahs, Eredu he commanded. In the ninth shah, fedai in exile on lammu was his fate. Now this is the account of the return of Anzu to nibiru and how a lalu on lammu was buried, how enlil on earth the landing place built. On nibiru there was for Anu a jai as welcome. Of what had happened to the council and the princes Anu gave account. Neither pity nor vengeance from them all he sought. To discuss the tasks ahead they all instructed."
