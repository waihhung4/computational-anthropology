" The Ancient Egypt and Ancient China are the two major ancient civilizations in the world. The Ancient Egyptian civilization began around 3250 BC and lasted for over 3000 years. Ancient Egypt was concentrated along the lower reaches of the Nile River. Since Europeans entered Egypt for archaeology, Western missionaries and researchers have proposed hypotheses that there is a relationship between ancient Egyptian civilization and ancient Chinese civilization. They believe Chinese writing is the result of the spreading of ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics and even the ancient history of Chinese legends is the history of ancient Egypt. This is basically a preliminary hypothesis based on their limited perceptual knowledge of pictograms. Since the beginning of the 20th century, a couple of scholars in China have also proposed the hypothesis that Chinese civilization and ancient Egyptian civilization share the same origin. But this is only a rough hypothesis that is based on the similarities of cultural comparisons. To understand the relationship between ancient Egyptian civilization and ancient Chinese civilization, it is necessary to fully decipher the ancient Egyptian writing. The French-Wa Shampoooyon was a French phallologist and orientalist, known primarily as the decipher of Egyptian hieroglyphs in the founder of the field of Egyptology. However, his decipherment of ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs was incomplete. He ignored the pictophonetic aspects and combined structure of hieroglyphics. He only focused on the phonetic part of hieroglyphics. What is the relationship between ancient Egyptian writing and Chinese characters? Is the archaeological history of ancient Egypt the same as the ancient times in Ciad dynasty history recorded in China? This requires first identifying a certain number of Chinese characters corresponding to ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics. Especially abstract concept words related to culture, history, and personal names. Scientific conclusions can be based on sufficient written evidence and then drawn through the proof logic of the double evidence method and the incomplete scientific induction method. As then independent research scholar in China, the author has opposed the integration theory of ancient Egypt and the Xia Dynasty of China, although the past decade, which has solved this to historical mysteries. The author's published books include discovering the Xia dynasty and the origin of civilization. The most common challenge in the comparative research on pictographs is... ...are they all look like that, so comparisons don't make sense. Regarding the pictographic depiction of simple natural objects, such as fish, sun, moon, grass, heart, melon, etc. such doubts are reasonable. However, the similarity in phonogram of pictographs corresponding to the same natural object is not necessary. For example, it is not surprising that the Chinese character Rhea, which represents the Sun, has a similar glyph as the ancient Egyptian Sun hieroglyph. However, their phonetics are also very similar, which cannot be ignored. And if there are more pictographs that represent abstract concepts, have similarities in pictograms, phonograms, and idiograms, this cannot be ignored by saying pictographs all look the same by. The author has identified nearly 400 Chinese characters corresponding to ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs, most of which belong to abstract concepts, and many of them are the names of historical figures or geographical places. The simplest example is the picture writing of a father, which represents an abstract concept of kinship. The ancient Egyptians used a horned viper to represent their fathers, and the glyph of the ancient Chinese character of father is very similar to the horned viper with the same phonogram. The year is an abstract concept representing time. The ancient Egyptians used a curved palm branch to represent it, and the glyph of the ancient Chinese character we are is similar to this, both of the same consonant and end. The Chinese characters corresponding to the abstract concepts of the ancient Egyptian royal titulary are more culturally convincing. The ancient Egyptian pharaohs were also known as the Sun of the Sun God, but the pharaoh's birth name itself was preceded by the title of the Sun of R.A. The ancient Chinese Emperor called himself Jina, which is the same as the title for the Sun of R.A. in pictogram and idiogram. When a pharaoh ascended the throne, his throne name was preceded by the title of King of Upper and Lower Egypt. The higher glyph of this title is highly similar to the Chinese character Jino in Oracle bone inscriptions. Jina referred to the ruler of a country before the chain dynasty in China. Similar to the title of the ruler of ancient Egypt. The ancient Egyptians used the swallow higher glyph to represent a great person or a feudal lord who was granted land. The Chinese character, Ho, is used to refer to feudal lords and is also highly similar to the higher glyph of swallow.
