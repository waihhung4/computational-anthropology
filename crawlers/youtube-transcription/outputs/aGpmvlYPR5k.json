"[Music] Sumerian stories have had significant influence on various aspects of ancient NE Eastern literature including the Hebrew Bible also called the Torah and the Tanakh it's important to note that the Bible is a collection of texts written by different authors over a long period of time and its composition was influenced by various cultural and literary Traditions including those of the Sumerians [Music] Sumerians were an ancient civilization that flourished in Mesopotamia modern-day Iraq around 4,000 to 2,000 BCE they left behind a rich literary tradition including mythological and epic text some of the Sumerian stories and motifs that influence the Bible the Sumerian creation myth known as the enuma Alish Bears similarities to the creation account found in the Book of Genesis both narratives involve the establishment of order from chaos and the separation of the heavens and the Earth Genesis 1:2 states that the Earth was formless and empty Darkness was over the surface of the Earth and the spirit of God was hovering over the waters notice how the waters are plural in the enuma elite it is two waters known as absu and Tiamat Hebrew for deep is Tome the word for Tiamat is cognate for deep so not only is there a connection between the way the story is written off the rib but we also have cognates in the language the two waters being opsu and Tiamat the Primeval Waters just as the surface of the deep hovering over the [Music] waters the Sumerian Epic of Gilgamesh contains a flood narrative that predates the biblical account of Noah's flood by thousands of years the similarities between the two stories such as the construction of an ark the preservation of animals and sending out a dove to find land suggests that the biblical flood story may have drawn inspiration from the Sumerian tradition Sumerians developed one of the earliest known legal codes known as the code of UR namu this influenced subsequent legal codes of the ancient near East including the biblical laws found in the books of Exodus Leviticus and Deuteronomy similarities in themes and regulations such as the concept of an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth the exact same phrase is found in Sumerian law codes now this is a very specific thing to say an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth which shows up in the code of hamurabi shows up in Leviticus when Yahweh tells Moses an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth these regulations regarding property and slavery suggests a shared legal Heritage the biblical Book of Proverbs Bears similarities to Sumerian wisdom literature such as the instructions of shupac just like the instructions of Aman op which I'll get to later both of these texts offer moral and practical advice on various aspects of Life Hebrew authors and editors transformed and adapted these surian stories to fit the religious and cultural context the influence of the Sumerian literature is evident in the themes motifs and narrative structures found in the Hebrew Bible this influence is a part of a broader cultural Exchange and continuity in ancient near East ugaritic stories specifically those discovered in ancient city of ugarit modern day Syria have also had an impact on the development of biblical literature ugarit was a flourishing citystate during the late Bronze Age from 1400 to 1200 bcee and its texts written in in Kuna form script provide valuable insights into the religious and cultural milu of the the ancient near East the ugaritic texts contain myths epic poems and ritual texts that have parallels and influences on certain aspects of the Hebrew Bible the ball cycle most famous ugaritic text a collection of mythological texts about the Canaanite god ball the ball cycle shares similarities with Biblical narratives particularly in the portrayal of a Divine conflict between a storm God and the forces of chaos these parallels can be seen in passages of the Psalms that describe yahweh's victory over chaos and the sea in descriptions of yahweh's control over the elements ball defeats the Leviathan just as Yahweh defeats the Leviathan in Psalms ugaritic text depict a Divine assembly or a council of gods with L as the head deity this assembly plays a role in Divine decision making and governance similar concepts are found in the Hebrew Bible where yah provides over a Heavenly Council as seen in passages like Psalm 82 and job6 Psalm 82 saying l presides in the great assembly he renders judgment among the gods the Elohim but also job 1:6 States now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before L and Satan came also among them both of these texts are not even hiding the fact that there are lesser Gods below the high God who is [Music] L ritual and lurgical texts contain descriptions of religious rituals and liturgies performed in honor of various ugaritic deities these texts offer insights into the religious practices and beliefs of the ancient e East some Scholars suggest the elements of the ugaritic rituals may have influenced certain aspects of Israelite worship such as the structure and content of Psalms and other poetic texts the ugaritic language closely related to Hebrew provides linguistic and lexical parallels that shed light on certain biblical terms and expressions the study of ugaritic has helped Scholars better understand and interpret Hebrew words and phrases found in the Bible Egyptian stories and called cultural influence are evident in various aspects of the Hebrew Bible Egypt a powerful and influential civilization in the near East had significant impact on the development Israelite culture and religious beliefs the story of The Exodus which describes the liberation of the Israelites from slavery in Egypt is one of the central narratives in the Bible the biblical account shares the same thematic elements and motifs with the Egyptian literature such as the idea of the Divine deliverer and confrontation between a powerful ruler and figure chosen by God while The Exodus story primarily reflects Israelite perspectives it is likely that the historical experience of the hixus leaving Egypt may have influenced this narrative some judeo-christian Scholars tried to link these as the same event however this is not likely considering the dates are separated by several centuries within the hix period we don't see a Moses or Joshua or Aaron and The Exodus story is likely a legend because even the Pharaoh is not named if this was a real story the Pharaoh should just be named and Scholars would be able to point to these events because we have so much data on every single Pharaoh we'd be able to know which of these pharaohs lines up with this story The the assumption that this was Pharaoh ramsy is not likely due to the fact that Ramsey conquers Canaan and in the text of the biblical story he fails to catch up to the Israelites which is the opposite of what happens with ramsy in fact after ramsy the land of Canaan was under Egyptian occupation for another 200 years which would not make any sense if Moses and the Israelites were setting up the Covenant during this time under Egyptian occupation the biblical Book of Proverbs contains wisdom sayings and teachings that are similar to those found in ancient Egyptian wisdom literature such as the instructions of Aman op in fact some of the manuscripts from the septu agent actually still have Aman op in the text both Traditions emphasize ethical conduct practical advice for daily life in the pursuit of wisdom Egyptian religious symbolism and imagery can be found in certain biblical texts for example in the Book of Ezekiel the prophets use symbols reminiscent of Egyptian religious motifs to convey his message the portrayal of pharaoh as a powerful ruler and the imagery associated with the Egyptian gods and goddesses also demonstrate the cultural influence of Egypt here on the stone of Hezekiah you can see an Egyptian ank present the use of hnic and lurgical elements in the Hebrew Bible shows similarities to Egyptian religious practices the Psalms contain hymns of praise and worship that share structural and thematic resemblances to ancient Egyptian hymns and prayers some of the legal Concepts in the Hebrew Bible bear similarities to Egyptian Lal Traditions just as the Sumerian and Babylonian texts do the Canaanites arguably have the most influence on the Hebrew Bible the Canaanite Pantheon of gods was a diverse and complex system of deities worshiped by the ancient Canaanites land that would be present day Israel right now who inhabited the region corresponding to present day Israel palistine Lebanon and parts of Jordan and Syria here are some key gods and goddesses from the Canaanite Pantheon number one L the same name is the god of the Hebrew Bible L is the chief deity in the Canaanite Pantheon and was associated with authority kingship and wisdom he's often depicted as an aged and bearded figure L presided over a Divine Council and held a central position in the Canaanite religious beliefs his son was Bale Bale was one of the most prominent gods in Canaanite Pantheon he was associated with the storms fertility and agricultural abundance Bale was depicted as a powerful Warrior wielding a lightning bolt symbolizing his control over the forces of nature El had a wife named Ashera the consort of L considered the mother goddess in Canaanite religion the Queen of Heaven she represented fertility motherhood and nurturing ashero was often depicted as the Divine mother figure sometimes portrayed alongside a sacred tree or a pole representing her presence a knot was a Fierce and warlike goddess associated with battle violence protection and wisdom like Athena and not was depicted as a warrior goddess often shown with a bow a spear or Shield aarte also known as ashra was the goddess associated with love beauty and sexuality she was considered the patron of fertility both in terms of human production and agricultural abundance a starte was depicted as a sensual goddess adorned with jewelry and symbols of fertility Deon associated with agriculture grain with fertility linked to water and agricultural Prosperity last last but certainly not least Yahweh often referred to as yahu the deity associated with a specific region or tribe rather than being a central figure in the broader Canaanite Pantheon the understanding of yahweh's role in the Canaanite religion is complex and subject to ongoing scholarly debate he was a tribal deity he's also one of the sons of L there are some who suggest that yah and baale are interchangeable depending on the location both being the son of L and both being extremely important as princes of the pantheon this may play into the later tradition of the Hebrew Bible where the priest of Yahweh are battling with the priest of Bale such as the story of Elijah and Jezebel another perspective suggests that Yahweh emerged through a process of syncretism where in the worship of Yahweh merged with elements of Canaanite religious beliefs and practices this view posits that Yahweh began as a local deity later absorb attributes and roles from other Canaanite Gods such as L and Bale Canaanite stories have significant impact on the Hebrew Bible given the close historical and cultural connections between the Israelites and Canaanites the Canaanites were the indigenous inhabitants of the land of Canaan which encompasses modern day Israel Canaanite mythology and religious beliefs cultic practices such as the sacrifices offerings and Temple worship biblical texts frequently mention Israelite interactions with kyanite religious practices often presenting them negatively that Israelites should avoid them the Canaanite practices and the Israelites response to them are discussed in the context of idolatry and the centralization of worship in Jerusalem the absorption of the Canaanite L into the Yahweh religion is a complex process that took place over an extended period of time L the chief deity in the pantheon associated with the authority kingship and divine Council becomes one and the same with his own son Yahweh and throughout the Hebrew Bible Yahweh and L or Lon which means god most high are interchangeable and mean the same thing at some points the biblical texts even refer to Yahweh as El Elon emphasizing his identification with the Supreme deity this suggests that the early Israelites may have seen Yahweh as a manifestation or an aspect of L as the Israelites settled in Canaan they likely interacted and assimilated elements of canite culture and religious practices the worship of L may have influenced the evolving understanding of Yahweh with L's attributes and characteristics merging with those ascribed to Yahweh the process of syncretism where in deities from different religious Traditions are combined or identified with each other likely played a role over time the Israelites established their religious identity there may have been a merging of L and Yahweh resulting in the understanding of Yahweh as the primary deity supreme authority [Music] L's association with the Divine Council consisting of subordinate deities can be seen in both Canaanite and early Israelite Traditions as the Israelite religion developed the concept of divine Council was retained but with Yahweh as the head of the [Music] council The Phoenician stories cultural influences left their mark on certain aspects of the Hebrew Bible the Phoenicians which are the purple people called by the Greeks are an ancient seafaring people who inhabited the coastal region of modern day Lebanon had significant interactions with the Israelites leading to the cultural exchanges and influences with direct evidence of Phoenician stories in the Bible the neoplatonist writer pory St stating that a priest named Sano nean of Beirut wrote the truest history because he obtained the records from hamis priest of yo that Sano nean dedicated his history to ababel King of beut and it was approved by the king and other investigators the date of this writing being around 1200 BCE in this text L who is also called Kronos sacrifices his own only begotten son yahud as an offering to his father in Heaven and then circumcises himself and decreed from that day forward that all of his offspring must also circumcise themselves in honor of arinos and L was deified as the star Saturn Saturday being the same day as the Sabbath this story is clearly bored by the Hebrew scribe for the Book of Genesis when Abraham who was offering his only begotten son Isaac as an offering to L but in this case an angel stops him however like in The Phoenician myth it is Abraham who is the first patriarch to circumcise himself and make this a custom among the Israelites for all males the Israelites had tendency to synthesize elements from neighboring cultures and the Phoenicians played a role in this process the worship of Canaanite deities including ball and Asher found its way into Israelite religious practices as described in the Hebrew Bible these influences can be seen in the biblical narratives of Israelite idolatry and their struggle to remain faithful to only Yahweh Phoenician expertise craftsmanship and Maritime trade likely influenced the construction of the first temple in Jerusalem known as the Solomon Temple Phoenician Artisans and materials were involved in the construction and some architectural and artistic elements may have been influenced by Phoenician Styles the Hebrew Bible contains references to Phoenician cities such as Ty and sidon and their cultural practices for example the story of King herum of Ty collaborating with King Solomon in the building of the temple highlights the close relationship between the Israelites and Phoenicians the first temple period in ancient Israel were first at the time when the first temple also known as Solomon's Temple stood in Jerusalem this period spans between approximately 10th Century BCE until its destruction by the Babylonians in 586 BCE understanding the religious landscape during this period is complex and scholarly views vary regarding the extent of polytheistic practices present during this time the practice of monotheism seems to be only after the Israelites return back from Babylon in the fth century Scholars suggest that polytheistic elements persisted during this period they argue that while Yahweh may have been regarded as the primary deity other gods and goddesses were still acknowledged in worship along longside Yahweh the archaeological evidence including inscriptions and artifacts found in Jerusalem indicate the presence of symbols associated with other deities during this time the elephantine Jews were a Jewish community that res resided in the ancient city of elephantine located on an island in the Nile river in Egypt they lived during the fifth century BCE and left behind a corpus of documents known as the elephantine papy which provides insights into the religious beliefs and practices of the time based on the elephantine papy it appears that the religion of the elephantine Jews was a blend of Yahweh worship and syncretic elements influenced by the local religious environment while they acknowledge Yahweh as the primary deity they also Incorporated certain practices from both Egyptian and Canaanite religious Traditions these elephantine Jews built and maintained a Temple dedicated to Yahweh on the island they considered Yahweh as the Supreme deity and sought his guidance and protection however alongside the worship of Yahweh was also other gods and goddesses like Asher one of the prominent deities mentioned in the elephantine papy is yaho often identified as a synchronistic form of Yahweh fused with Egyptian gods like Ammon additionally Egyptian gods particularly Kum satis and anuket were worshiped in this location these deities were believed they have protective powers and were invoked for various purposes such as for ility health and general well-being this elephantine Papyrus indicates a level of polytheism and syncretism as well as cultural assimilation where elements of different religious Traditions coexisted overall the elephantine Jews maintain a distinctive religious identity centered around Yahweh but also Incorporated beliefs and practices from their local environment their religion demonstrates the complex nature of religious syncretism and the adaption of religious traditions in a multicultural text the exact time frame for the final compilation of the Torah or the first five books of Moses Genesis Exodus Leviticus Numbers and Deuteronomy into its current monotheistic form is a subject of scholarly debate most Scholars agree that these texts were written during post Babylonian exile as the Israelites returned to their land religious leaders and scribes likely engag in the process of collecting editing and shaping various religious texts there is no mention of the Torah by any Greek Egyptian Persian or Syrian sources before the 5th Century BCE Moses and Noah and Abraham are not mentioned in any text before the fist century B.C only the Kings like David and omry show up in some stellies but the stories of the flood The Exodus and the 12 tribes of Israel show up in popular culture only after Alexander the Great conquers Persia in the 4th Century bcec there are some Scholars who now suggest that the five books of Moses were compiled in Alexandria During the talic period ancient historians like Herodotus xenophon and thiddies don't even mention Israel in their writings this suggests that Israel was not a powerful Kingdom just a small city state it's possible that these texts existed as independent Scrolls during these periods but they were not known to most of the world outside the lant until the 4th Century bcee this is the end of our mythological Journey Through the ancient Realms of Sumer ugarit Egypt Canaan and Beyond as we've explored this Rich tapestry of these captivating civilizations it became clear that their stories beliefs and cultural influences have left an indelible mark on the biblical World from the Epic tales of the Gilgamesh and Sumer to the poetic sagas of ball and ugarit from the mystical hymns of the Egyptian gods to the intricate Pantheon of the Canaanite deities we find a treasure Trove of inspiration that seeped into the very fabric of the Hebrew Bible but the skilled Weavers the biblical authors and editors didn't simply copy and paste from the neighboring mythologies oh no they expertly Blended transformed and repurposed these ancient narratives weaving them into a new tapestry of Faith history and moral guidance let me give you one more example example before I go the story of Esther and morai Esther and morai look a lot like ishar and Marduk the story of Esther and morai has obvious parallels to the story of ishar descending into the underworld to save tamus from his death in the story of ishar and tamus tamus is taken down to the Underworld the lover of Ishtar and then ishar goes and descends down and as she goes down from every layer of hell she has to take off a layer of clothing until she gets to the bottom layer where she has to face off with the queen of the underworld where she stays down there for 3 days until her galy Unix are sent down from heaven to bring her back to life where she is able to take tamuz and raise him out of hell and thus springtime ensues in the story of Esther in the Bible there's a lot of similarities and parallels instead of tamus it's morai now why would they use marduk's name instead of Tam's name well it turns out that Marduk and tamos are actually synchronized in many texts the god Bell is actually a synchronization of Marduk and dutzi or tamuz so it actually does make sense for morai to be the name of the Hebrew person who was saved by Esther in this text morai is taken into a dungeon by hamon and then Esther has to go into the court of the King of Persia xerses and she has to plead for the safety of morai which she is successful when her unic priest just like the golly Unix her Unix actually come to her Aid and she also has to take off layers of clothing as well it is a clear mimesis of the story of the Sumerians I am of the opinion that these writers did did this with no ill intent and they were just trying to pass down sacred stories that everyone knew the Samarian floodman Finds Its counterpart in the story of Noah in the ark the Canaanite storm God Bale's conflict with the sea god yam Echoes the biblical portrayal of yahweh's triumph over chaos and the grandor of Egyptian cosmology lends his majesty to the descriptions of Heaven and Earth in Genesis yes this interplay between mythologies goes beyond mere literary borrowings it reveals the interconnectedness of ancient civilizations the vibrant exchange of ideas and the Eternal Quest For Humanity to understand the mysteries of the world in our place in it Esther just like Ishtar is a story that explains the death of the winter and the resurrection of the spring both Ishtar and Esther have their festivals at the same time of the year let us Marvel at the Prof Prof found influence of these ancient mythologies on the biblical World let us recognize that shared motifs cultural cross-pollination and the universal truths that emerge from these diverse narratives as we delve into the depths of History we uncover not only the roots of our Collective
