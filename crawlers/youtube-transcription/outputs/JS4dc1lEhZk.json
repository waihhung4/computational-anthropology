a country but a region made up of a number of Walled city-states each with its own King the name Suma means the land of the black-headed people but they were also known as the land of the Civilized Kings by The acadians Who occupied the northern region of Mesopotamia while Suma occupied the South by 2900 BCE the Sumerians were firmly established in southern Mesopotamia but where they originated from is still unknown Mesopotamia which from the Greek means land between two rivers is aptly named due to the land being surrounded by the Tigris and the Euphrates rivers although the rivers flooded unpredictably the silt made the land more fertile which allowed for a well-developed agricultural system the ubaid period dating between Circa 5000 and 4100 BCE is the first era of this region as defined by modern Scholars and it was this early civilization which led to the development of the Sumerian city-states in the next period the Uruk period the Sumerian civilization in Mesopotamia is split into six sections and it was the early dynastic period between 2900 and 2334 BCE which saw the rise of kingship structured government bureaucracy and Interstate fighting over water and land rights multiple Kings tried and failed to become the sole ruler over the Sumerian city-states including NM baragessi of Kish who in around 2700 BCE led the Sumerians to Victory against Elam in the first war ever recorded however none of these Kings fully controlled all of the Sumerian city-states until Sargon of akid also known as Sargon the Great came to power Sargon reigned between 23 34 and 2278 BCE and made Suma the core of his multinational Empire he was successful because he placed trusted officials in powerful positions in each City including his daughter and herduana who became the high priestess of the Goddess inanna at er the Acadian Empire founded by Sargon the Great was invaded by the people known as the gutians and they held the region until they were driven out in around 2047 BCE by Erna mu and his son shall give ER who were responsible for the so-called Sumerian Renaissance this period saw the Resurgence of Sumerian culture after the Acadian and gutian conquests [Music] one of the most important Innovations by the Sumerians was writing the writing system of the Sumerians is known as cuneiform and is the oldest written language which dates to around 3500 BCE the development of writing was to facilitate long-distance communication and trade and was the beginning of documented history the alphabetic script of cuneiform was used all throughout Mesopotamia by different cultures but in their own languages such as the Assyrians the elamites the acadians and the Babylonians great works of literature which survive to us such as the Epic of Gilgamesh and Andrew Diana's hymns to Anana were composed in the region of Suma in the cuneiform script the Sumerians developed the first schools and jobs they developed the first cosmology which grapples with the understanding of how the cosmos and the universe might be explained and the first cosmogony which is the origins of the universe and how everything came into existence they also essentially developed the concept of time by dividing day and night into 12-hour periods each hour into 60 minutes and each minute into 60 Seconds from the Sumerian city of air some of the oldest wheeled vehicles in history were discovered although the oldest wheel in the world was discovered in Central Asia the two four-wheeled vehicles found at er give the Sumerians credit for the invention of the wheel the Sumerians also hold the honor of the creation of the city with the world's oldest city arguably being the Sumerian city of Uruk at the heart of each Sumerian city would be a temple complex that was marked by the great ziggurat which was a multi-leveled Monumental structure which proliferated throughout Mesopotamia the archeology of Suma establishes Uruk as the older City but the Sumerians believed that eredu was the first city in the world presided over by enki the god of water and wisdom eridu was seen as the home of the Gods and the birthplace of the rules governing civilization and in Mesopotamian mythology it was comparable to the biblical Garden of Eden [Music] much like the Egyptians religion was incorporated into every aspect of life and informed the government and social structures the Sumerians believed that the individual's goal in life was to work with the gods who had formed the world out of chaos to make sure that the chaos didn't return humans were considered co-workers to the gods and were rewarded depending on how they performed their duties in accordance to the God's will the Sumerian city-states were governed by a Lugal which literally means big man and is understood as a king the Lugal was in charge of overseeing the cultivation of the land waging Wars maintaining order and making sure the will of the gods were implemented and understood in daily life the Lugal could be overthrown if they began to lose battles if the crops died or any other upset which suggested that they were no longer favored by the Gods the Sumerian civilization began to decline with the reign of the Babylonian King Hammurabi who Incorporated Zuma into his larger Babylonian Empire Hammurabi is famous for creating one of the world's first law codes although it was preceded by the code of ernammu of Suma which he may have drawn from Hammurabi also elevated Marduk as supreme god over the Sumerian Pantheon and after his other reforms both women's rights and the great Sumerian cities began to decline since male deities and Babylonian culture were elevated finally in 1750 BCE the Sumerian civilization collapsed after the invasion of the elamites which caused widespread cultural and social change the Sumerians were unknown in the Modern Age until the mid-19th century when European and American institutions funded archaeological expeditions to the region to find physical evidence which corroborated biblical narratives what they found instead was the Sumerian civilization whose stories of the great flood and the fall of Man and other Tales predated similar biblical stories by millennia the discovery of the Sumerian culture revolutionized the understanding of the origins of the Bible as well as that of world history What similarities do you see
