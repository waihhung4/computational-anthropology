southern song when Emperor taido came to power he expanded the Civil Service examination system and oversaw a project to map the entire Empire the song saw the Revival of Confucianism and a greater prominence of the scholar official class but the song wasn't as strong militarily as its tongue Dynasty predecessor it couldn't establish itself as the dominant power in Asia thus the northern song
