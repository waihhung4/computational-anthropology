"In the year 401 BC,\nat the height of the period known as the Greek Golden Age,\na Persian prince named Cyrus the Younger was fighting a bitter civil war against\nhis brother, and was trying to seize the throne of Persia.\nTo help him in this fight, he hired a mercenary army of mostly Greek soldiers;\n10,000 men who travelled the long road to Persia to fight on his behalf.\nAmong them was the Greek writer and adventurer named Xenophon,\nand he later wrote about this expedition in his work entitled Anabasis.\nXenophon and his companions met the enemy Persian army at the battle of\nCunaxa, on the banks of the Euphrates River,\nand they gave the Persian prince Cyrus value for his money.\nThe Greek heavy troops beat the Persians back,\nand delivered a victory for the man who had hired them.\nBut when the dust of battle had cleared, they heard the bad news.\nCyrus the Younger had been killed, apparently knocked from his horse by a\nyoung common soldier. His claim to the throne of Persia had\ndied with him, and the war was over. For the Greeks, this must have been\nheartbreaking. Their long journey, the victorious battle,\nand all their sacrifices had been for nothing.\nTheir general had also been killed and all of their senior commanders captured,\nleaving them without a leader and stranded in the middle of a foreign land.\nNow Xenophon and what remained of his 10,000 men had to find their way\nhome to Greece. They knew that their only route was to\nreach the Black Sea, which lay across the wide deserts of what is today Iraq.\nThey were terrified.  They had few supplies and the enemy army was already\npursuing them close behind. They hastily elected some leaders from\namong them, and Xenophon was one of them. He told his men to throw away everything\nthey carried, shedding weight in order to outrun their\nenemies. So, they pelted across the deserts\nand the fertile river lands dotted with date palms, following the course of the\nriver Tigris north. It's while they fled in this manner\nthat they stumbled upon something that must have made them stop in their tracks.\nIt was the enormous crumbling ruin of a city,\ncompletely deserted, and full of the vast ruins of ancient\nbuildings. This city was larger than anything\nXenophon had seen back home in Greece, and later he wrote about this discovery\nin his work Anabasis. The Greeks continued their march\nunmolested through the remainder of the day and arrived at the Tigris River.\nIt was a large, deserted city. This wall was 25 feet in breadth, 100 in height,\nand the whole circuit of the wall was 11 kilometers.\nIt was built of clay bricks rested upon a stone foundation six meters high.\nNearby this city was a pyramid of stone, a plethrum in breadth\nand two plethora in height. Upon this pyramid were many barbarians\nwho'd fled away from the neighboring villages. But Xenophon didn't have time to linger.\nThe pursuing Persians were right behind them, and he couldn't spare any time to\nexplore the ruins. They dashed onwards,\nfollowing the river north. But then, only a day or two later, the\nGreeks came across another ruin, this one even larger and more impressive,\nsurrounded by an enormous series of crumbling walls. The Greeks marched 34 kilometers to\na great stronghold, deserted and lying in ruins.\nThe foundation of its wall was made of polished stone, full of shells. It was 15\nmeters in breadth and 15 in height. Upon this foundation was built a wall of\nbrick 15 meters in breadth and 30 meters in\nheight, and the circuit of the wall was 30\nkilometers. Once again, they had no time to stop,\nbut it's clear that the sight of these lonely crumbling ruins affected Xenophon.\nFor days afterwards, he asked any local people he encountered who had built such\nenormous constructions all alone out there in the desert.\nNo one he spoke to could tell him anything, and it seemed no one even knew\nthe names of these great cities. Some people thought they might have been\nbuilt by the Medes, a people who now occupied the area.\nOthers told fantastical stories about the gods bringing down fire and thunder\nto destroy these ancient walls, killing everyone who had once lived\nwithin them. Today, we do know the names of these\ncities, and it's thought that Xenophon, at the end of the 5th century BC,\nwas the earliest person to stumble upon them and write an account.\nThese were the cities of Nimrud and Nineveh.\nAt the time when Xenophon stumbled across these ruins nearly two and a half\nmillennia ago, the first stones of the Parthenon in Athens had been laid only\n50 years earlier. The Colosseum in Rome would not be built for another 500 years.\nBut the city of Nineveh had already been an ancient ruin for more than two\ncenturies. This mighty city had flourished, boomed\ninto a towering capital home to hundreds of thousands of people.\nIt had given birth to some of the ancient world's most beautiful art and\narchitecture, and then all at once fallen into dust.\nXenophon and his men did eventually return to Greece, and when he wrote his\nmemoirs, he gives special attention to those moments when he looked out over\nthe sand-blasted desert, the grasses sprouting between the\ncrumbling bricks as the wind battered his hair and tugged at his clothes.\nIn those moments, Xenophon must have asked himself,\nwho were these people? Who built such vast cities out here in the desert?\nHow could such a great metropolis vanish so completely beneath the sands?\nIf so many people had once lived there,\nwhat in all the world could have happened to them? My name's Paul Cooper and you're\nlistening to The Fall of Civilizations podcast.\nEach episode, I look at a civilization of the past that rose to glory\nand then collapsed into the ashes of history.\nI want to ask what did they have in common? What led to their fall?\nWhat did it feel like to be a person alive at the time who witnessed the end\nof their world? In this episode, I want to look at one of\nthe most remarkable ancient civilizations; the society known today as\nthe Assyrian Empire. I want to explore how the Assyrians\nbuilt their empire out of the ashes of the Bronze Age and built an empire of\niron that lasted for centuries. I want to show how they expanded and\ndeveloped to become perhaps the world's first military superpower, as well as\nfostering an extraordinary flourishing of art and learning.\nFinally, I want to tell the story of what happened to cause their final,\ndevastating collapse. In this episode, we return for the first\ntime to a setting that we've seen before, in Episode 8 on the Sumerians.\nThese are the arid desert lands of Mesopotamia. Mesopotamia is a vast floodplain.\nFor millions of years, its lands have been watered by two great rivers; the\nriver Tigris and the river Euphrates. These great watercourses flow south from\nthe mountains of Turkey, and bring enormous quantities of silt down with\nthem. If we were to soar high above the\nearth's surface, we would see these two rivers as vivid lines of green snaking\nthrough the dusty land. The rivers Tigris and Euphrates form one arm\nof a geographical feature that has come to be known as the Fertile Crescent.\nThis is an area of land roughly in the shape of a half moon\nthat runs from the marshlands of southern Iraq\nnorth up the silt-rich rivers, then west to the humid coast of Syria.\nThe Fertile Crescent continues south through the mountainous lands of Lebanon,\ndown the Mediterranean coast of modern Israel and into Egypt, watered by the\nriver Nile and its rich delta. Surrounded by high, treacherous mountains\nto the north and east, bounded by the Mediterranean Sea in the west, and the\nimpassable deserts of Arabia to the south,\nthis sweeping corridor created the environment\nwhere some of the world's first great societies rose up. To us, the Assyrian Empire feels like a\nrelic of the impossibly distant past, but it's worth reminding ourselves that\nfor them, their world was already ancient. The earliest settlements in this region,\nlike the ones found at Gobekli Tepe and Catalhoyuk are truly ancient, each\nbetween 12,000 and 9,000 years old. They are some of the first evidence we\nhave of humans living in large societies after the end of the Ice Age.\nBut the Assyrians also had an incredibly rich awareness of their own ancient\nhistory and the cultural roots of their society.\nSince the invention of writing by the Sumerians around the year\n3200 BC, humans had been passing their knowledge\ndown from generation to generation, and it's hard to overstate just how powerful\nthis was. The Assyrians held onto the memory of\nseveral of the great kings of the Sumerian age, revering them as\nsemi-mythical heroes. Among these was the legendary hero\nGilgamesh, who slayed monsters and went on a quest to find the secret of eternal\nlife. They still told stories about the\nAkkadian king Sargon the Great, who, for the later Assyrians, had lived nearly two\nmillennia in the past. For them, Sargon was about as distant in\nthe past as Julius Caesar is for us. But his name was still on their lips;\nthey still told stories about him, wrote about him, and drew inspiration from him,\nas this middle Assyrian text called Sargon the King of Battle demonstrates.\nWhile Sargon dwelt in the land, his heroes with him, twelve he chose.\nHe brought his army across the fir-tree land.\nHe conquered the cedar mountain. He took for his weapon the lightning\nbolt of his god. Like the Sumerians before them, the\nAssyrians saw the ruins of ancient cities scattering their landscape, and\ndeveloped stories to explain how they got there.\nThey believed that a great flood had once washed over the world,\nand that these ruined heaps of stone and brick were a remnant of this destructive,\nancient event. So, I think it's worth reminding\nourselves right at the outset that the Assyrians did not think of themselves as\nwe might think of them, as an early culture at the dawn of human history, but\nas a people on the cutting edge of human progress,\nthe product of a long and ancient line, and the culmination\nof all that humanity was capable of. Since the fall of the Sumerian Empire,\nthe language of Akkadian had become the region's most common tongue, replacing\nthe old Sumerian language, and the cities that had once formed part\nof the Sumerian empires had broken away. They were now a loose constellation of\nindependent city-states dotted up and down the rivers Tigris and Euphrates.\nEach city had their own king, their own army, and their own god.\nAs we saw in Episode 8, for much of the region's early history, the Akkadians had\nbeen something of a junior partner to their Sumerian cousins.\nBut now, with the collapse of Sumer, the Akkadian cities of the north were\nfinally free, and they set out on their own journeys.\nOne of these cities was the city of Ashur. Ashur was occupied from at least the\nyear 2500 BC.\nIt was founded at the height of Sumerian rule on a bank of the river Tigris in\nnorthern Iraq, about halfway between the modern cities\nof Tikrit and Mosul. Ashur was probably an early\ntrading city. It would have been a town of tents and houses built from river\nclay, thatched with reeds.\nThe smells of cattle and wood smoke would have drifted through its muddy\nstreets, the sounds of people and the fluttering\nof the leaves of date palms, perhaps already the first canals being dug to\nwater its fields. In its early days it would have been a\nvery humble place, and it would be hard to imagine the\nglorious legacy that its people would one day construct.\nThroughout the Sumerian period, the town of Ashur did well, and some of this was\ndown to its natural advantages. It was nestled on a bend of the river\nTigris that sheltered it on its north and east side, and its builders improved\nits natural defenses with a system of strong buttressed walls that made it a\nstrong fortress. The rivers of Mesopotamia were the\nland's lifeblood. They brought water for drinking and to\nirrigate the fields, but in the rough landscape, they also acted as the\nhighways along which trade could move on barges and ships.\nCarvings of the time show long boats powered with oars\nforging over the brown waters of the rivers, carrying wheat and barley, copper\nand tin, as well as fine woods and stone from the north.\nAs a crucial stop along one of these rivers, Ashur soon grew to be a wealthy\nplace. Excavations of its houses show that by\nthe second millennium, many of them were spacious mansions.\nIt became common for wealthy families to keep vaults beneath their floors to hide\ntheir many valuables; jewelry made of gold and polished brass inlaid with\nsemi-precious stones like carnelian, agate, and the brilliant blue lapis\nlazuli. Excavations have even uncovered dozens\nof libraries and archives in the city, where texts written in cuneiform on clay\ntablets were stored, a clear indicator of a city overflowing with wealth. The wealthy families of Ashur were also\nable to donate handsomely to religious organizations,\nand the city would become home to no fewer than 34 temples\nto the various gods worshiped by all the people of Mesopotamia,\ngods like the sun god Shamash and the moon god Sin, the storm god Adad, Ishtar,\nthe goddess of love and war, and of course, the king of the gods, Enlil.\nWe can imagine walking through the city streets at this time and hearing the\nincantations washing out of the temple doors and overlapping in the hot air, the\npriests of the different gods competing for attention in the crowded city, the\nringing of bells and the banging of drums, the singing of hymns.\nFuneral processions may have floated past, chanting poetry such as this\nsurviving devotional hymn to the Babylonian god Marduk.\nThe man who is departing in glory, may his soul shine radiant as brass.\nTo that man may the son give life, and Marduk, eldest son of heaven, grant him an\nabode of happiness. The temples also performed services for\nthe sick. If you visited the temple of Ishtar with\nan ailment, it's likely you would have heard something like this prayer being\nsaid over you by one of its priests. Bind the sick man to heaven,\nfor from the earth he is being torn away. Of the brave man who was so strong, his\nstrength has departed. In his bodily frame, he lies dangerously\nill, but Ishtar, who in her dwelling is\ngrieved for him, descends from her mountain, unvisited of\nmen. To the door of the sick man she comes.\nSoon, like most cities of this time, the city of Ashur developed a god of\nits own. In fact, the city virtually became a god. In the religious systems of Mesopotamia,\ngods and cities had an intimate and interwoven relationship.\nThe gods of this time performed many of the duties that they do for us today.\nThey could be called for in times of need or given sacrifices to ward off\nevil. But at this time, each city also had a\ngod in the same way that every sports team has a mascot.\nThe god was believed to quite literally live in the highest chamber of the\ncity's temple, often in a statue dedicated to them.\nIf you visited another city on business, it was considered sensible to give an\noffering to the city's god while you were there, and if two cities went to war,\nit was thought that their gods were battling it out in the heavens just as\ntheir armies were fighting down on earth. The more a city succeeded, the more\npower its god was presumed to have. As the city of Ashur grew in importance,\nits people named the city's god after the city itself,\nand so, the god Ashur was born. Grand temples were thrown up to this new\ndeity, and as the city went from strength to strength, worship of Ashur rose to\nbecome the highest form of religion for its people.\nThis god rapidly took on new symbols and iconography.\nHe became thought of as a robed man wearing a crown and holding a bow,\noften appearing in carvings at the center of a winged disc, looking down on\nthe world and the golden city over which he presided.\nAs the confidence of the cult of Ashur grew, eventually the position of Enlil as\nthe king of the gods, a position he had held for a thousand years, was in\njeopardy. Over the next centuries, the god Ashur\neven took over Enlil's wife, the goddess Ninlil, and his sons Ninurta and Zababa.\nAshur and not Enlil was now the supreme god for this city's people. The people of the city of Ashur would\nsoon become known as Ashurayeh, but today we call them Assyrians. Like many of the powerful cities of this\nregion, for the next millennium or so, the Assyrians of the city of Ashur would\nmake several attempts to found their own kingdom,\nand a number of times, they succeeded. One great king named Shamshi-Adad ruled\nat the end of the 19th century BC, and he conquered large areas outside of\nAshur, bringing back great wealth to the city.\nUnder his reign, the people of Ashur built a grand, royal palace, and the\ntemple to the god Ashur was furnished with a ziggurat, an enormous stepped\ntower that in the Bronze Age was a statement of a city's membership to an\nelite and powerful club. But this early flourishing of Assyrian\npower was stamped out by the rival power of Babylon, a powerful city in the south,\nthat established its own empire under the famous King Hammurabi. This was the fate of the people of Ashur\nfor much of the second millennium BC. They were able to rise a little bit\nbefore being swallowed up by a bigger fish.\nThey were folded into the empires of Babylon, the Mitanni, and the Hittites, and\nwould usually spend a century or so as a possession before throwing off their\nrulers and once more going it alone. But throughout this time, there was also\na flourishing of Assyrian culture. One epic poem known today as the Tukulti-\nNinurta epic, has survived from this time. It glorifies Assyrian military conquests\nin the south, and sets out a model for how the ideal Assyrian king should\nbehave, and it also contains a vision of the\nfierce war-like spirit of the Assyrian people. They charged forward furiously to the\nfray without any armor. They had stripped off their breastplates,\ndiscarded their clothing. They tied up their hair and polished their weapons.\nThe fierce, heroic men danced with sharpened weapons.\nThey blasted at one another like struggling lions,\nwith eyes flashing. Particles drawn in a whirlwind swirled\naround in combat. Death, as if on a day of thirsting, slakes\nitself at the sight of the warrior. But as the second millennium BC drew to\na close around the years 1200\nto 1150 BC,\nthe Assyrians would face a challenge of astonishing\nmagnitude. The period that followed has gone down\nin history with the name the Bronze Age collapse.\nAs we saw in our second episode, for reasons we still don't entirely\nunderstand, a wave of destruction would soon wash over this region.\nHordes of a mysterious force known as the Sea Peoples would land on its shores.\nFamine would spread from city to city. This destruction would sweep whole\ncivilizations off the map, and leave virtually no inhabited cities\nleft in the eastern Mediterranean region. Only two great societies emerged on the\nother side of this destruction; one was Egypt.\nAs we saw in our second episode, the Egyptians managed to stop the Sea\nPeoples in a daring ambush on the waters of the Nile Delta, and just about held\ntheir society together. The other was Assyria.\nIt survived by withdrawing from its recent conquests\nand holding on to only those territories that were essential to keeping its trade\nroutes open. It withdrew back to its heartland and\nsurvived in a diminished form. But as the wave of destruction ended, the\nchallenges that Assyria faced were enormous,\nas the historian Georges Rue recounts. Towards the end of the 10th century BC,\nAssyria was at her lowest ebb. Economic collapse was impending. She had lost all\nher possessions west of the Tigris, and her vital arteries, the great trade\nroutes that ran through the mountain passes, were in foreign lands.\nHostile highlanders occupied not only the heights of the Zagros, but the\nfoothills down to the edge of the Tigris Valley, while Aramaean tribes pitched\ntheir tents almost at the gates of Ashur. At this time, a serious territory\nconsisted of little more than a strip of land along the river Tigris, surrounded\non all sides by determined enemies. But there were also things to be\nthankful for. For one thing, Assyria's enemies seemed\nincapable of uniting. For much of this history, they hated each\nother as much as they hated the Assyrians,\nand this would prove crucial for Assyrian survival.\nIn the flat plains of Iraq, Assyria had no natural boundaries or defenses. For\nits survival, it relied on the fact that its enemies could be dealt with one by\none. The powerful Assyrian army could march\none way, then the other, smashing each enemy in turn, and subsequent kings would\ndo everything they could to ensure that this continued to be the case.\nThe main cities of Assyria were also virtually untouched by the disaster of\nthe Bronze Age collapse, and they continued their economic output\nthroughout the crisis. Assyria still had chariots and horses\nand weapons. It had access to iron, the new metal that\nhad been used for ceremonial and decorative objects for centuries, but was\nonly just beginning to be used to forge weapons and armor.\nThe introduction of iron meant that Assyria was no longer dependent on the\nfragile supply of copper that came to them from across the mountains in the\nfar away mines of Afghanistan. Iron occurs ten times more commonly in\nthe earth's crust than copper, and could be found just about anywhere.\nThe warriors of Assyria had been trained by years of constant fighting, and were\nnow among the best in the world. Perhaps most importantly, the line of\nroyal succession had supposedly not been broken for more than 200 years,\nmeaning that the kings of Assyria claimed to draw on an ancient and\nunchallenged legitimacy among their people.\nIn this region at the time, no other state could say the same.\nTo at least one Assyrian king, it must have seemed clear that if Assyria\ncould only seize its opportunity, it could become a power unlike any that had\nbeen seen before. That man's name was Tiglath-Pileser I.\nTiglath-Pileser ascended to the throne in the year 1114\nBC. He was the son of a harsh ruler named\nAshur-resha-ishi I. His father had been remorseless in his\ncampaigns, giving himself the title \u201cthe avenger of Assyria\u201d and \u201cmerciless hero of\nbattle\u201d. One surviving edict by his father\ndeclares that the penalty for fraternizing with palace women was to be\nthrown into an oven, and it's clear that Tiglath-Pileser inherited at least some\nof his father's harsh reputation. A series of laws was written during his\nreign called the Middle Assyrian Law Code, and they included incredibly harsh\npunishments against women. In one, a married woman who has an affair\nis decreed to be killed. But he was an energetic ruler\nand a skillful campaigner. One of his royal inscriptions describes\nhim in the following manner. Unrivaled king of the universe, king of\nthe four kingdoms, king of all princes,\nlord of lords whose weapons the god Ashur has sharpened, and whose name he\nhas pronounced eternally for control of the four quarters,\nsplendid flame which covers the hostile land\nlike a rainstorm. This kind of overflowing self-praise is\nquite typical of how all Assyrian kings described themselves, but in the case of\nTiglath-Pileser, it's clear that the challenges he faced were indeed\nformidable. He had inherited an Assyria that was\nthreatened on multiple fronts. In the north, climate shifts have been\ndriving nomadic horsemen into the northern plains.\nThe Mushku people of Syria had occupied certain Assyrian districts in the upper\nEuphrates Valley. The Hittite people had also snatched\nsome of its territory, and the powerful rival of Babylon still\nlay to the south. But Tiglath-Pileser didn't waste any\ntime. He attacked the Mushku first and conquered them, and then drove out the\nHittites and Arameans, and everywhere he went, he placed a\nrecord of his victories. In one of the strong fortresses he built\nalong his border, he engraved the following message on a series of copper\nplates in the base of the walls. Altogether, I conquered 42 lands and\ntheir rulers, from the other side of the Lower Zab in\ndistant mountainous regions to the other side of the Euphrates, people of Hatti,\nand the Upper Sea in the west. The king at Tiglath-Pileser also loved to\nhunt, and he delighted in bringing back live specimens of animals from the far\naway lands that he campaigned in. I killed ten strong bull elephants in\nthe land Harran, and the region of the river Habur, and four live elephants I\ncaptured. I brought the hides and tusks of the\ndead elephants along with the live elephants back to my city of Ashur.\nIt's hard to know how the average Assyrian citizen of the time would have\nfelt about all of this, since their accounts were not recorded.\nWe can imagine that at the very least, a great deal of wealth would now be\nflowing into the city of Ashur. Teams of construction workers would have\nbeen working day and night to build new palaces and gardens in the city.\nExotic, never-before-seen animals might now be seen on the streets, while access\nto new trade routes may have meant that new spices and fabrics would have begun\nto appear in the city markets. Tiglath-Pileser swept his Assyrian\narmies west, and when he conquered the Hittite town of Pitru, he gained control\nof the highway to the Mediterranean Sea, a distant body of water that, for the\nAssyrians, constituted one edge of the entire world.\nAssyria at this time was the only great power in this region with no access to a\ncoastline, and we can see something of the wonder in the king Tiglath-Pileser\u2019s\nwords when he boasts about going on board a ship for the first time.\nThe Assyrian chronicles even record that he hunted and killed some kind of sea\ncreature known as a nahiru. I killed\na nahiru, which is called horse of the sea\nin the great sea of the land of Amurru. We don't know what this animal was. Many\nbelieve it may have been a dolphin or a whale, while others say it was likely a\nhippopotamus. But it shows what a novelty it was for the king of the landlocked\nkingdom of Assyria to finally reach the water. Tiglath-Pileser died in the year 1076 BC,\nand on his deathbed, he must have looked back on a life of staggering success.\nDuring his violent rule, Assyria recovered much of the territory that it\nhad lost over the period of the Bronze Age collapse.\nHe had grown his kingdom into an empire that was all but unmatched in the region,\nand he must have looked ahead to the dawning of a golden age for Assyria.\nBut the fortunes of Assyria would soon change for good with the reign of a king\nnamed Adad-Nirari II. Adad-Nirari was crowned in the year 910 BC,\nnearly 3,000 years ago, and it's worth mentioning that his reign is perhaps the\nfirst event in the entirety of Near Eastern history that can be dated to an\nexact year with a hundred percent confidence.\nThe Assyrians, like the peoples before them, didn't keep track of years with\nnumbers like we do. Instead, they gave each year a name,\nsometimes named after a particular person as a kind of honor, or named after\na significant event that had taken place, like a great battle or an eclipse of the\nsun. Assyrian scribes kept long, meticulous\nlists of these year names, along with brief notes about important events that\nhad taken place, as the following example shows,\ncorresponding to three years at the end of the eighth century BC.\nThe year of chamberlain Tab-shar-Assur, the city of Dur Sharruken was founded.\nThe year of Shamash-upahhir, governor of Habruri; Kummuhi was conquered, and a\ngovernor was appointed. The year of Sha-Assur-dubbu, governor of\nTushan; the king returned from Babylon, the vizier and nobles, the loot of Dur-\n-Jakin was destroyed, on the 22nd of Teshrit, the gods of Dur-Sharruken entered\nthe temples. This system worked well enough for\npeople of the time, but it means that if a modern historian wants to work out the\ndate of a particular event, they need to have an unbroken list of year names, and\nfor that list to include a known historical event\nor an astronomical event that can be clearly dated, like a solar eclipse.\nLuckily for us, the Assyrians were obsessed with eclipses, believing them to\nbe important omens from the gods, and they kept incredibly careful note of\nany that occurred. The reign of Adad-Nirari is the\nbeginning of the earliest one of these lists.\nHe was an ambitious king, and he soon began to expand in all directions into\nwhat is today Turkey, Iran, and the Mediterranean coast, drawing on the\nstrength of the formidable Assyrian army. The life of an Assyrian soldier was a\ntough one. Adad-Nirari's armies were made up\nprimarily of men drawn from the fields. They would spend much of their year\nworking on farmsteads with their families, digging canals and turning the\ndusty earth with plows and hand tools, growing beans and pulses, wheat and\nbarley, raising livestock like sheep, pigs, and cattle.  Then when the spring came,\nthe rains stopped and the winter mud hardened across the land,\nthey would be gathered up, given a spear and a shield made of woven reeds, and\nmarched up into the rocky hills or out into the barren desert to fight for the\nempire. Sometimes they would fight other settled\nsocieties who lived in walled towns. Other times, their opponents would be\nnomadic tribesmen or even other Assyrians who had rebelled.\nIt must have been a confusing and frightening experience for these men,\nand no doubt many despised being forced into this service.\nBut perhaps there were also those who enjoyed it.\nWithout these annual excursions, many of them may never have seen a mountain or\nan ocean, or anything of the world outside their town or village.\nSince the Assyrian army tended to win more than it lost, there must have\nbeen a certain sense of pride in their shared accomplishments. This rhythm of a season of harvest in\nthe autumn and a season of war in the spring\nformed the heartbeat of the Assyrian Empire.\nIt was a drumbeat of expansion and conquest that was continued by the king\nwho came to the throne in the year 883 BC,\nand who would carry the Assyrian Empire to new and unprecedented heights.\nHis name was Ashurnasirpal II. Ashurnasirpal was a remorseless and\nruthless warrior, and many of the things we associate\ntoday with the kings of Assyria, their cruelty and harsh treatment of enemies,\nreached a climax under his rule. Much like many rulers of this time\naround the world, it's clear that he used terror tactics and tortuous methods of\nexecution to drive fear into the hearts of his enemies.\nBut his inscriptions, out of all those of the kings of Assyria, do stand out for\nthe delight they seem to take in the details of these terror tactics.\nAfter crushing one rebellion to his rule, Ashurnasirpal commissioned this\ninscription describing what happened next.\nI burnt many captives from them. I captured many troops alive.\nFrom some, I cut off their arms and hands. From others, I cut off their noses, ears,\nand extremities. I gouged out the eyes of many troops.\nI made one pile of the living and one of heads.\nI hung their heads on trees around the city.\nI burnt their adolescent boys and girls. I razed, destroyed, burnt, and consumed\nthe city. Whether because of these tactics or\ndespite them, in the short term, Ashurnasirpal was an effective conqueror.\nNew conquests were turned into client states and ordered to pay tribute to the\nAssyrian Empire. Enormous wealth began to flow once again\ninto the imperial center, and Ashurnasirpal celebrated his victories with\nthe construction of even more grand palaces. I founded a palace of cedar, cypress,\njuniper, boxwood, terebinth, and tamarisk as my royal residence,\nand for my lordly leisure for eternity, I made sculptures of beasts of the\nmountains and the seas in white limestone and alabaster, and placed them\nat its doors. I decorated it in a splendid fashion;\nI hung doors of cedar and cypress in its doorways, and put therein silver, gold,\ntin, bronze, and iron, treasure from the lands I conquered.\nI took people which I had conquered from the lands over which I had gained\ndomination and settled them there. This policy of resettling conquered\npeople in Assyria wasn't new, but Ashurnasirpal seems to have employed it far\nmore frequently than his predecessors. The Assyrians understood a very simple\ncalculation in the ancient world, that population size meant power,\nand they quite happily filled their cities with people from all corners of\ntheir empire. They created what must have been some of\nthe most cosmopolitan urban environments before the modern age, and we can only\nimagine what it must have been like for these conquered peoples to be uprooted\nfrom their villages and deposited unceremoniously in the vast metropolitan\ncities of the Assyrian heartland, larger than any town they had ever seen,\nand where hundreds of languages would have been heard on the streets. But the Assyrians also used deportations\nand relocations in a much more punitive way,\nand this policy also reached its height under Ashurnasirpal.\nDeportation may sound like something of a light punishment when compared to the\nfates of some of those who stood in the way of the kings of Assyria,\nbut it was a brutally effective tactic for crushing resistance to the empire.\nHuman beings during this time and throughout history are so connected to\nour landscape that this kind of uprooting had a devastating\npsychological impact on the peoples it was done to.\nThis technique of mass deportations was so effective that it has been employed\nby modern dictators. Joseph Stalin famously deported at least six\nmillion people in the 20th century from more than 20 ethnic minority groups\nconsidered to be troublemakers, and in the early days of the American\ncolonies when indigenous people were taken as slaves, they were always\ntransported to another region to break their relationship with the land and\nreduce their chance of escaping. Whether despite this cruelty or because\nof it, King Ashurnasirpal did manage to keep the empire together and\ndramatically expanded it, but he was followed by his son, a man\nnamed Shalmaneser III, who would not be so capable.\nShalmaneser enthusiastically continued his father's\npolicies of aggressive expansion and mass deportation,\nbut in the final years of his reign, the people of Assyria had had enough.\nAn enormous rebellion led by his son broke out across the entire empire.\n27 cities, including the city of Ashur, rose up in rebellion,\nand this long and bitter civil war allowed virtually all of the people that\nAshurnasirpal had conquered to shake off Assyrian rule.\nAssyria\u2019s heavy-handed military domination of the region had made them hated, and it\nwas clear that if they hoped to ever build a lasting empire, something would\nhave to change. One king named Tiglath-Pileser III\nthought he knew what that thing was, and it was not a softer and more\ndiplomatic approach. He decided in characteristic Assyrian\nfashion that what the empire needed was a much more powerful army. Up until the middle of the 8th century\nBC, the Assyrian army was much the same as\nany other force in the region, only a good deal larger,\nand the numbers really are staggering for the time.\nShalmaneser III, the son of Ashurnasirpal, once boasted a force of 120,000 men at a\ntime when the world population has been estimated at only 50 million.\nIf his inscriptions are to be believed, then at that time, around\n0.25 percent, or one in every 400 of the world's entire population, was at that\ntime serving in the Assyrian army. But it was still a force made up of\nvirtually untrained peasants. The only professional soldiers\nwere bodyguards that protected the king and other nobles,\nbut these were mostly deployed in the cities and palaces, and rarely saw battle.\nThe vast bulk of the Assyrian army was made up of farmers, who as we've seen,\nwere plucked from their lands whenever the need arose,\nfollowing the heartbeat of the seasons. Although the empire could summon a vast\nhorde of soldiers, it was an ineffective force.\nWhen the autumn came around and the barley grew golden in the fields, these\narmies of farmers had to march right back home and bring in the crops,\notherwise the people of the empire would go hungry.\nGathering this huge army from the fields was an immensely time-consuming and\ndifficult task. Rebellions could break out at any time\nof year, but if one occurred in some far corner of the empire, the Assyrians had\nto wait until summer for their campaign to begin.\nIt would take months to gather all the soldiers required, and then another month\nor two to march across the region to face it.\nBy the time they arrived, it would be nearly time for the annual harvest, and\nthe men would have to march all the way back home.\nIf they were clever, a rebellious city could simply lock its gates\nand wait behind their walls for the armies of Assyria to go away, and in many\ncases, this is exactly what they did. But in the year 745 BC, the king Tiglath-\n-Pileser came to the throne. He chose his royal name after the king\nwho had brought Assyria to such greatness more than three centuries\nbefore, who had forged a path to the\nMediterranean and killed that sea creature known as a nahiru.\nThis new king Tiglath-Pileser engaged in a radical program of reforming the\nAssyrian military into perhaps the first truly modern army.\nHe reformed the core of the military into a body of elite armored troops,\ncavalry, and chariots, and he demanded that conquered\nterritories on the edges of the empire supplied all of the army's light\ninfantry who were considered expendable and often bore the brunt of the\ncasualties. The Assyrian army also pioneered the use\nof a large engineering component to its fighting force.\nAssyrian soldiers could build bridges and dig tunnels, construct fortifications\nand siege engines, as well as maintain the supply lines needed to keep an army\ngoing. This combined fighting force of soldiers\nand engineers was similar to the formula that would make the Roman military so\nformidable seven centuries in the future. Assyrian carvings show remarkably\ndetailed scenes of the army crossing one of the land's great rivers,\nsomething they must have had to do multiple times a year.\nWe see Assyrian men blowing into tied-up sheepskins to inflate them and use as\nbuoyancy aids, chariots dismantled and turned into\nboats, rafts constructed to transport supplies and equipment;\narmy engineers could even cut paths through the treacherous mountains,\nas this inscription written by the late Assyrian king Sargon II seems\nparticularly proud of. Mount Simirria is a great mountain peak\nthat points upward like the blade of a spear. Its summit touches the sky above,\nand its roots are made to reach down below into the netherworld.\nIt is not fit for the ascent of chariotry or for allowing horses, and its\naccess is very difficult for even the passage of foot soldiers.\nI had my vanguard carry strong copper axes; they cut through the high mountain\ncrags as if they were limestone, and thereby improved the path.\nI took the lead of my army and made the chariotry, cavalry, and battle troops fly\nover the mountain as if they were brave eagles.\nI had the common soldiers and like infantry follow behind them. The camels\nand donkeys bearing the baggage leapt up its peaks like the ibexes native to the\nmountains. I had the numerous troops of the god Ashur ascend its difficult slopes\nin a good order, and then I set up camp on top of that mountain. Tiglath-Pileser also increased production\nof iron in the empire. It was a small-scale industrial\nrevolution. Assyrian cities of this time must have\nbecome increasingly smoke-filled, the furnaces belching charcoal smoke, the\nsound of billows and clanging hammers echoing off the buildings.\nThe use of iron allowed the Assyrians to enter the era of true mass production.\nAssyrians could now use iron to make arrowheads, knives, pins, and chains,\nwhile Assyrian soldiers now marched with iron swords, iron spear blades, iron\nhelmets, and iron scales sewn into their tunics.\nThe effect was immediate. In the year 743 BC,\nonly two years after coming to the throne, King Tiglath-Pileser marched north\nagainst the kingdom of Urartu, and conquered it easily.\nTwo years later, he marched west into Syria against the kingdom of Arpad. The people of the city of Arpad had\nfought the Assyrians before, and they knew what to do.\nThey would simply close their gates and hold tight.\nThe Assyrian army may have looked fearsome, but they knew that when the\nsummer came to an end, they would have to go home and harvest their fields just as\nthey always had. But as autumn came, the people of Arpad\nmust have realized that something was wrong.\nThe Assyrians showed no sign of going home.\nIn fact, it looked like they were settling in for a long stay.\nTiglath-Pileser lay siege to the city of Arpad for three years, something that\nwould have been impossible with the old seasonal armies.\nWhen the city finally fell, the Assyrian king ordered Arpad to be destroyed and\nits inhabitants slaughtered. It was a clear message to all those who stood in\nthe empire's way, that a new age was dawning. Much like superpowers today, the Assyrian\nEmpire treated the areas outside its boundaries as zones of extraction,\nwhere life was cheap and all that mattered was the empire's continued\naccess to their resources. Assyria would grow rich from the\nvast wealth it extracted from these areas.\nOne text written during the reign of that cruel king Ashurnasirpal II\nlists all the wealth drawn from a single campaign of terror against the region of\nBit-Zamani. I received harnessed chariots,\nequipment for troops and horses, 460 harness-trained horses,\ntwo talents of silver, two talents of gold, 100 talents of tin,\n100 talents of bronze, 300 talents of iron, 3,000 bronze\nreceptacles, bronze bowls, bronze containers,\n1,000 linen garments with multi-colored trim,\ndishes, chests, couches of ivory and decorated\nwith gold, the treasure of his palace, also 2,000 oxen, 5,000 sheep, his\nsister with her rich dowry, and the daughters of his nobles. On top of this, 15,000 slaves\nwere rounded up and brought back to Assyria to labor in manual jobs and\nprovide a workforce for the empire. In campaign after campaign, Tiglath-\n-Pileser conquered lands in Syria, and marched all the way down the\nMediterranean coast, taking coastal cities all the way to Egypt.\nHe invaded the northern kingdom of Israel, destroyed their army,\ninstalled a puppet king, and deported large numbers of Hebrew tribes back to\nlands in Assyria. Tiglath-Pileser also added one more\nremarkable new possession to the list of Assyrian conquests;\nthat was the mighty and ancient capital of the south, the great city of Babylon. The city of Babylon had been the\npolitical and religious heart of southern Mesopotamia for more than a\nthousand years. It was perhaps the most ancient and\nrevered great city in the region, and at this time, it ruled over an area known\ntoday as Babylonia. This is a landscape of marshes covering\nmuch of the south of what is today Iraq on the coast of the Persian Gulf.\nThis was once the largest wetland in the Middle East,\nhome to countless rare species of bird, and the reeds often grow so high that\nyou can't see over them. Mesopotamia had once been divided\nbetween the Sumerians in the south and the Akkadians in the north,\nbut this had now evolved to become Babylonians in the south and Assyrians\nin the north, and it's a cultural division that still\nexists today. In modern times, the distribution of the\nSunni and Shia regions of modern Iraq roughly follow this same geographical\ndivide. Babylon was the largest city in the\nworld at several points in history, and it was perhaps the first city to ever\nreach a population above 200,000.\nToday, its awe-inspiring ruins sit about 85 kilometers south of Baghdad, a\nsprawling mass of crumbling walls. Its famous Ishtar Gate, with its ornate\nblue glazed tiles, its depictions of oxen, lions, and dragons were at this time\nstill several centuries in the future, but Babylon would have still been a\nresplendent city glittering in the sun. Tiglath-Pileser's conquest of\nBabylon shifted the balance of power in Mesopotamia.\nBy the year 736 BC, the empire encompassed almost the whole\nof the region known as the Fertile Crescent.\nIt now formed an unbroken corridor from the Persian Gulf to the Mediterranean,\nlinking up the trade routes of the Indian Ocean with those of North Africa\nand Europe. Its roads would have been thick with\ncaravans of donkeys and camels, its rivers full of barges carrying spices\nand precious stones, wheat, barley and fruit,\ngold and silver, and brass. It was this empire and the formidable\narmy it now commanded that the king Tiglath-Pileser III would pass down to\nhis younger son, who would found the greatest dynasty of\nthe Assyrian age. His name was Sargon II,\nnamed after that great ancient Sumerian hero.\nHis dynasty would be known as the Sargonid Kings.\nThey would rule for three generations that would form the highest point of the\nempire's achievements in war, art, and literature, but they would also be the\ntwilight of its age. When these three generations ended,\nthe empire would finally collapse in ash and flame. At this point, I think it's worth pausing\nand asking what was life like for the average citizen of the Assyrian Empire?\nDue to their officious record-keeping, we actually have a great deal of detail\nabout how the people of ancient Mesopotamia lived.\nLike the Sumerians ,the Assyrians wrote on clay tablets, which is lucky for us\nsince it has made their texts incredibly durable.\nAn enormous number of these pieces of writing have been recovered, so many that\nan estimated 90% have still never been looked at by a trained expert, and\nfar less translated. The experience of reading these tablets\nis like hearing the babbling of countless voices speaking up to us from\nthe impossibly distant past about a remarkable array of everyday matters.\nJust one out of countless examples is this letter from a child away at school\ncomplaining to his mother that the other children have nicer clothes than he does.\nTell the lady Zinu her son Iddin-Sin sends the following message;\nfrom year to year, the clothes of the young gentleman here become better, but\nyou let my clothes get worse from year to year.\nThe son of Adad-Iddinam, whose father is only an assistant of my father, has two\nnew sets of clothes, while you fuss even about a single set for me.\nIn spite of the fact that you gave birth to me and his mother only adopted him,\nhis mother loves him while you, you do not love me. As a result of this rich collection of\ntexts, we can paint a remarkably clear picture of what life was like for these\nvery ancient people. Walking the streets of a great Assyrian\ncity during this time would have engaged every one of your senses.\nOne such city was Nineveh, which would soon become the capital of the empire,\nthe same city that the Greek writer Xenophon would one day pass by\nwhile fleeing from the Persian army pursuing him.\nNineveh was an enormous city for the time.\nIts city walls were 12 kilometers long, built of a stone foundation surmounted\nby mud bricks and enclosing an area of seven and a half square kilometers.\nThe wall was broken by fifteen gates, many of them named after gods such as\nthe Adad Gate named after the god of storms, or the Shamash Gate after the god\nof the sun, while others carried more descriptive\nnames like the Desert Gate or the Gate of the Water Carriers.\nThe city was surrounded by a moat filled with water from the river Tigris.\nThe city would have been a kaleidoscope of rooftops,\nbuilt in a largely unplanned manner, and its alleyways would have been covered\nwith mats and reed awnings to keep off the heat, much as they still are in Iraq\ntoday. In the courtyards of houses, skins of\nwine and jars of water hang from the rafters to cool.\nWe can imagine a joint of meat boiling in a clay pot on a fireplace,\nthe smells of baking bread wafting from a clay charcoal oven nearby.\nThe following recipe for lamb stew translated from a clay tablet shows the\nkinds of smells that would have been wafting through the city streets in the\nafternoon. Stew of lamb;\nmeat is used. You prepare water. You add fat.\nYou add fine grain salt, dried barley cakes, onion, shallot, and\nmilk. You crush together and add leek and\ngarlic. Like the Sumerians before them, the\nAssyrians loved to drink beer. They drank it in groups, sipping it from large urns\nthrough hollow reed straws. Beer held a prominent place in Assyrian\nculture, and this inscription by the late king Ashurbanipal shows that even in the\nhighest royal circles, it was considered among life's greatest pleasures.\nIn my reign, there is prosperity. In my years, there is abundance.\nMy kingship is good as the choicest oil. Good beer I have placed in my palace. Nineveh sat on the river Tigris, and had\na bustling dock and waterfront beside the gate known as the dock gate.\nThis would have been a vibrant place full of the smells of dried and fresh\nfish, stagnant water, and mud, the babbling of the crowd, people arguing over prices\nand shouting greetings in dozens of languages.\nMerchants would sail downstream on barges or ships woven from reeds, perhaps\ntraveling south to Ashur or Babylon with clay urns full of beer or wine.\nThe following letter contains instructions from a wine merchant to a\nfriend. Tell Ahuni Belanum sends the following\nmessage; may the god Shamash keep you in good health.\nMake ready for me the myrtle and the sweet-smelling reeds I spoke to you\nabout, as well as a boat for transporting wine.\nBuy and bring along with you ten silver shekels\u2019 worth of wine and join me here\nin Babylon sometime tomorrow. But the Tigris was a fast-flowing river,\nmuch faster than the Euphrates, and sailing back upstream was very difficult.\nSo, traders would often make the journey back by road, accompanied by caravans of\ndonkeys. The road system was now much improved\nsince the time of the Sumerians, and a sophisticated highway network now joined\nall of Assyria's major cities, with milestones at regular intervals telling\ntravelers how much further they had to go. But the roads were often dangerous,\nand although soldiers would patrol them, banditry was extremely common.\nOne letter from a local governor shows his frustration with the lack of\nresponse to the bandit problem. Tell Sin-Iddinam Sillee sends the\nfollowing message; I have written to you repeatedly to\nbring here the criminal and all the robbers,\nbut you have not brought them, and so, fires started by the robbers are\nstill raging and ravaging the countryside.\nI am holding you responsible for the crimes which are committed in the\ncountry. In the cities, a great deal of life took\nplace on the roofs of houses. During the day, women would gather on\nthese roofs to perform the duties of maintaining their homes.\nThey would pound grains into flour and knead the dough to make bread,\nprepare food, wash linen, and hang it out to dry. We can\nimagine them talking with their neighbors from roof to roof as they\nworked, and the sounds of their laughter drifting overhead.\nDuring the hottest hours of the day, with the Iraqi sun often reaching more than\n40 degrees Celsius or 104 degrees Fahrenheit, the heat would drive everyone\nindoors. The finer houses of the city often had a\nkind of cool room, with a floor made of polished alabaster or marble, and the\nwalls painted with plaster. During the hottest parts of the day, the\nfloor and walls would be splashed with water to cool the air inside.\nThe city's poor would sleep on reed mats while the rich had wooden bed frames\nwith mattresses and coverings. The richest of the citizens had beds\nmade of ivory and fine carved woods. It's not just people that were\nthought to live in this city; the Assyrians believed that the world was\npopulated by countless demons and spirits who could not be seen or heard,\nbut whose influence could constantly be felt, and who often manifested as bad\nsmells. These demons were responsible for\nillnesses and disease, and they required the constant attention of exorcists to\nexpel them. The following letter recounts the\nprocedure for one exorcism for a person suffering from epilepsy.\nAs soon as something has afflicted him, the exorcist rises and hangs a mouse and\na shoot of thornbush on the vault of the patient's door.\nThe exorcist dresses in a red garment and puts on a red cloak.\nHe holds a raven on his right arm, a falcon on his left,\nand recites the incantation \u201cTruly, you are evil!\u201d\nAfter he has finished, he makes another exorcist go around the bed of the\npatient, followed by incense and a torch,\nand recites the incantation \u201cBegone evil hutupu!\u201d\nuntil the demon is driven out. He does this every morning and evening. Talismans were often used to ward off\nthese evil spirits, often small statues in bronze or clay, sometimes precious\nstones like jasper. They were often frightening images of\ndemons with the wings and heads of goats and dogs, and the tails of scorpions.\nThese would be kept in every corner of the house to ward off evil.\nAs you walked the city, you would see these small talismans hanging from the\nrooftops. For many Assyrians,\none crucial everyday object was what's called a cylinder seal.\nThese were a small cylinder of stone, some no larger than a battery, which had\ncomplicated designs and symbols carved into them. The idea was that someone\ncould prove their identity using this seal, and they could be used to sign\ncontracts just like a signature. People would wear them around their\nnecks on a string, and when a contract was written on clay, they would roll the\ncylinder over it so that their unique image was left printed on it.\nYou could even seal a chest, an urn, or a door using clay or wax, and then print it\nwith an official seal so that everyone knew the last person to open it.\nThe following letter of instruction to a member of the king's household shows the\nimportance that these seals held in all manners of official business.\nTell Manaya that Siqi-ilani will be coming to you\ncarrying the cylinder seals to reseal the entrance of the warehouse,\nand also the cylinder showing a lahmu monster for resealing the chests.\nGet everyone together, open the storehouse, and take as many as\nyou can carry of the garments which are in the chests under my seal. Put your\ncylinder seal on whatever has been returned,\nand send me back the seal cylinders. But these cylinders were expensive,\nand they signified that their holder was an important person of high class.\nRegular people had to get by without one, and to sign a contract, they would simply\npress their fingernails into the clay, meaning that the marks of these ancient\npeople's hands are still left on some of these documents. The people who lived these countless\nlives in the streets of the great Assyrian cities were probably largely\nunaware of what was going on in the vast, grand palaces that loomed over their\ncities. They would have likely followed the\ncomings and goings of kings with some interest the way we might pay attention\nto celebrity gossip, but to them, the inner workings of the\nroyal palace would have been as inaccessible and mysterious as the\ncenter of the earth. But what happened in those inner\nchambers would have an enormous effect on their lives,\nand as that final great dynasty of Assyria, the Sargonid Kings, took to the\nthrone, the dramas of the royal court\nwould soon have deadly consequences for all those who called Assyria their home. The drama of the Sargonid Kings truly\nbegins with the son of Sargon, a man named Sennacherib.\nHe came to the throne in the year 705 BC, and he would begin one of the most\nremarkable family dramas to come down to us from the ancient world, and he would\nbe the father and the grandfather of the last two great kings of Assyria; Esarhaddon\nand Ashurbanipal. This great drama got off to a remarkably\nrocky start. Sennacherib's father, Sargon, had been a\nrespected and feared king, but it's clear that something about\nSennacherib meant that he didn't quite hold the same level of command.\nAfter only two years of his rule, several Assyrian vassals in the foothills to the\neast, in Syria, and along the Mediterranean coast all suddenly stopped\npaying their tribute to the empire. The Egyptians, always happy to throw sand\nin the eyes of the Assyrians, moved to back the rebels\u2019 fight for independence,\nand the young Sennacherib quickly found himself plunged into a fight for the\nempire's survival. The young king quickly gathered the full\nforce of the imperial army and dealt with the rebel kings in the usual\nAssyrian fashion, taking them on one by one.\nHe first marched east and crushed the peoples of the Iranian lowlands.\nThen he marched north and around the Fertile Crescent to the Mediterranean\ncoast, and reconquered the rebellious kingdoms there, as he recalls in the\nfollowing inscription. With the weapons of the god Ashur, my lord,\nand my fierce battle array, I turned them back and made them retreat.\nI quickly slaughtered and defeated the king of the land of Elam,\ntogether with his magnates who wore gold jewelry like fattened bulls restrained\nwith chains. I slit their throats like sheep and cut\noff their precious lives like thread. Like a flood after a rainstorm, I made\ntheir blood flow over the broad earth. The swift horses, harnessed to my chariot,\npulled into floods of their blood. The wheels of my war chariot, which lays\ncriminals and villains low, were bathed in blood and gore.\nI filled the plane with the corpses of their warriors like grass.\nI cut off their lips. I cut off their hands like the stems of cucumbers in\nseason. One of these campaigns is remarkable\nbecause we have accounts of it written by both the winners and the losers in a\nlevel of detail almost unprecedented anywhere else in the 8th century BC.\nThis is because its records have survived not just in the chronicles of\nAssyria, but also in the Bible. This was Sennacherib's campaign against\nthe Kingdom of Judah. The Kingdom of Judah was one of the\nregion's two major Hebrew kingdoms, and it centered on the powerful city of\nJerusalem. It had once been part of a united\nKingdom of Israel, but in the face of Assyrian aggression, the kingdom had been\nbroken up. It was now divided into the Kingdom of Israel in the north ruled by\na puppet king, and Judah in the\nsouth. The Judean king at the time was a man named Hezekiah.\nHe was an energetic ruler and seems to have been driven by religious fervor. The religion of the ancient Israelites\nwas something of an oddity in this region at the time, because it disallowed\nthe worship of any god but the Hebrew god Yahweh.\nAs we've seen, worship in places like Assyria was a much more eclectic affair.\nYou might make offerings to Marduk while you were visiting Babylon on business,\nand make an offering to Ashur when you got home. You might make an offering to\nEa if your son was going on a long voyage by boat, or to Gula if someone you\nknew was sick. In the Assyrian worldview, the gods of\nother cities were often seen as hostile and were thought to be subordinate to\nthe great god Ashur, but they were still thought to very much exist.\nIn fact, the Assyrians had a habit of kidnapping the gods of their conquered\nenemies. Sometimes when they captured a new city,\nthey would take the statues of its gods back to the Assyrian capital as a way of\nharnessing their power for themselves. But the religion of the Hebrews was\ndifferent; it held that there was only one god.\nIf you worshiped any other deity, it was believed that you were at best talking\nto the air, and at worst communing with evil spirits.\nKing Hezekiah was one of the most strident religious rulers of ancient\nJudah. He enacted sweeping religious reforms,\nincluding strict instructions to worship only the Jewish god Yahweh.\nHe removed all other statues and icons from the temple of Jerusalem, as the Book\nof Kings, Chapter 2:18 in the Hebrew Bible recalls. Now it came to pass in the third year of\nHoshea, son of Elah, king of Israel, that Hezekiah, the son of Ahaz, king of Judah\nbegan to reign, and he did that which was right in the eyes of the lord,\naccording to all that David, his father, had done.\nHe removed the high places and broke the pillars,\nand he broke in pieces the brazen serpent that Moses had made,\nfor unto those days, the children of Israel did offer to it. Perhaps it was Hezekiah's religious\ndevotion that led him to make the enormous gamble of defying the Assyrian\nEmpire, or perhaps the recent rebellions in\nAssyria had emboldened him, and he believed that it might be on the brink\nof collapse. Whatever his calculation, it backfired\ncompletely. He soon heard news that the Assyrian\nking Sennacherib was marching out to punish the Kingdom of Judah with the\nfull might of the Assyrian army. The news coming from the north would\nhave been terrifying. Sennacherib first conquered the rebels\nof Ekron, and then swung his armies south to march on\nJerusalem. On the road, he came across the fortified\nJudean city of Lachish. Lachish was the second-most important of\nthe cities of Judah. It was built on a hill about 40\nkilometers to the southwest of Jerusalem, and had a strong wall running\nall the way around it. The hill was steeper on the north side\nand for defensive purposes, this is where its gate had been built.\nWe can imagine the sight that the citizens of Lachish would have seen one\nday in the year 701 BC. From the north, a great cloud of dust\nwould have begun to gather on the horizon,\nlooking like some great natural disaster on its way.\nAs the dust grew closer and thicker, you would have been able to hear the\nvibrations through the earth. If you've ever been inside a large\nsports stadium at full capacity, try to imagine what three or four times as many\npeople would sound like all marching together in their heavy\narmor, along with their horses and the clattering of chariot wheels and\nharnesses. Finally, the enormous force would have\ncome into view like a shadow on the land. In the center of their formations, the\nmain body of infantry would have massed, organized into tight, compact units,\ntheir spear points glittering in the sun. Even more terrifying would be the\ntrundling wheels of enormous siege engines\ncome to tear down the walls of the city. The Judean military was insignificant in\ncomparison. They were made up of militias and\nmercenaries huddled behind the walls of Lachish that must have suddenly seemed\nlike a pitiful defense. What happened next is depicted on a\nremarkable series of carvings etched in meticulous detail in gypsum, designed to\ndecorate the walls of Sennacherib's southwest palace in Nineveh.\nIn their day, these carvings would have been coloured, their details picked out\nwith dyes of green, blue, red, and yellow. The Lachish relief\nis an incredible piece of art, although the events it depicts are horrific.\nIt's a perfect snapshot of a moment in history that would otherwise be\ncompletely lost, capturing the clothes and the faces of the soldiers and the\nfrenzied action of the battle. The Assyrians first built a camp and\nbegan to settle in for a long siege of the city,\nand it's here that their expertise at engineering came into play.\nAs the weeks dragged by, they slowly built a ramp of stone and earth leading\nup to the city's walls. It would have been around-the-clock\neffort. Assyrian workers toiled to form the mud\nbricks that made up the ramp, baking them in the sun,\nwhile soldiers shielded the workers as they built it, the occasional arrow or\nslingstone whistling down from the defenders on the walls.\nThe desperation of the city's defenders can be clearly seen in the\narchaeological record at the site of Lachish.\nAt some point, we can see that they ran out of iron, and in desperation began to\ncarve new arrowheads out of bone. Finally, when the ramp was completed, the\nvast Assyrian siege engines would have rumbled into life.\nThese siege engines were something like an iron age tank.\nThey were made up of a large wooden frame like a mobile fortress on enormous\nwheels. They had a tower on top from which\narchers could rain fire on the defenders. At the front of the engine was a large,\nheavy instrument, somewhere between a battering ram, a spear, and a hammer. This\nwas used to break the mud brick walls of enemy cities,\njimmying between the gaps in the bricks and stones, and slowly wearing them down.\nDefenders would constantly try to set these engines on fire, and so, they were\ncovered in thick layers of wet animal hides.\nA constant stream of Assyrian workers would hurry up to the front lines,\ncarrying jars and skins of water, dousing the engine and putting out the fires.\nAs well as these engines, the Assyrians would have laid countless ladders\nagainst the walls. The defenders rained down arrows and\nstones, but the result was inevitable. The defense collapsed. People fled the\ncity in all directions, and the Assyrian army finally marched\ninto Lachish. From here on, the carvings begin to look\nlike a depiction of hell. As a punishment for resisting, the city\nof Lachish was utterly destroyed. The inhabitants of the city were rounded\nup and deported to faraway lands on the other side of the river Tigris.\nThe carvings show them leaving the city in long columns,\nmen and women riding bullock carts piled high with all their possessions,\nchildren sitting on the carts or cradled in their mother's arms.\nThe carvings even show some prisoners being forced to play musical instruments\nas they march away from their home, an episode perhaps also recorded in the\nancient lament of Psalm 137. By the rivers of Babylon, we sat and wept\nwhen we remembered Zion. There on the poplars we hung our hearts,\nfor there, our captors asked us for songs. Our tormentors demanded songs of joy.\nThey said sing us one of the songs of Zion.\nHow can we sing the songs of the lord while in a foreign land? It's in this psalm too that we get one\nof the first recorded warnings delivered to the empire of Assyria\nabout the fate that might befall it in the future,\na fate that its various enemies were increasingly beginning to long for. Daughter Babylon, doomed to destruction,\nhappy is the one who repays you according to what you have done to us.\nHappy is the one who seizes your infants and dashes them against the rocks. Next, the Assyrian army marched on\nJerusalem, and Hezekiah was ready for them. He'd built a new wall around the great\ncity, and dug an underground tunnel through solid stone that would bring\nfresh water directly into the city. But even so, the situation must have\nlooked bleak. The Judean king decided that he would\nhave to negotiate. \"Now in the 14th year of King Hezekiah did Sennacherib, King of Assyria, come up against all the\nfortified cities of Judah and took them. Hezekiah, king of Judah, sent to the\nking of Assyria to Lachish, saying\n\u201cI have offended. Return from me\nthat which thou putted on me will I bear.\u201d The king of Assyria appointed\nHezekiah, king of Judah, 300 talents of silver and 30 talents of gold.\" In order to pay the bounty, he even\nstripped the gold from the great temple, something that must have been a\nheart-rending decision for this devout king.\nBut this seems to have hardly appeased the Assyrian king Sennacherib, who\ncontinued his siege. At one point, he sent his general, a man\nnamed Rab-Shakeh, to approach the walls of Jerusalem\nand demand the surrender of its defenders.\nThe Assyrian general Rab-Shakeh reminded the Jewish holdouts of all the\nother lands that had fallen to the military might of the Assyrians. Have any of the gods of the nations ever\ndelivered his land out of the hand of the king of Assyria?\nWhere are the gods of Hamath and of Arpad? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim? Of\nHena? Have they delivered Samaria out of my\nhand? It looked as though all was lost,\nbut it's at this point that luck began to turn in Hezekiah's favor.\nThe Hebrew Bible recalls him praying to his god Yahweh to deliver him from the\nAssyrian siege, and the Hebrew poet historians who wrote\nthe Book of Kings record this reply coming down to him from the heavens. Now have I brought it to pass.\nYea, it is done, that fortified cities should be laid waste into ruinous heaps.\nTheir inhabitants were as the grass of the field and as the green herb,\nand as the grass on the housetops, and as corn blasted before it is grown up.\nThus saith the lord concerning the king of Assyria; he shall not come unto this\ncity, nor shoot an arrow there. Neither shall\nhe come before it with shield, nor cast a mound against it.\nIt came to pass that night that the angel of the lord went forth\nand smote in the camp of the Assyrians 104 score and 5,000.\nWhen men arose early in the morning, behold; they were all dead corpses. We may never know the truth of what\nhappened to bring an end to the siege of Jerusalem.\nThe most likely explanation is probably an outbreak of plague among the army of\nAssyria. Plague was a constant threat to any\ncampaigning army, and it wouldn't have been the first campaign to end in this\nway. One Egyptian account repeated by the\nlater historian Herodotus, recounts how the Assyrian army was turned back after\nan infestation of field mice swarmed their camp.\nThe mice are said to have gnawed away at the Assyrian bowstrings and shield\nhandles, making them unable to fight. This is possibly another slightly\nfanciful description of a plague decimating an army. The Assyrian sources\nare understandably quiet about what must have been an embarrassing failure.\nThe only source to mention this campaign focuses on the early victories won by\nthe Assyrians, and on the tribute that Hezekiah handed over.\nThis campaign gives just one brief snapshot of what the Assyrian war\nmachine was like, and how it felt to be on the receiving\nend of its fury. Still, the campaign had ended in an\nembarrassment, and it was perhaps this defeat that led the city of Babylon in\nthe south to desire its freedom. The question of what to do with Babylon\nwas one of the constant pressing concerns of the Assyrian kings, and it\nhad been a thorn in their side for centuries.\nBabylon was a proud and ancient city with a distinct culture, and it was so\npowerful that it was exceptionally difficult to keep it in the empire.\nVarious Assyrian kings tried different approaches to this problem.\nSome simply allowed a native Babylonian to rule the city and its surrounding\nterritories, which kept the Babylonian people happy,\nbut this often led to the Babylonian king declaring independence whenever the\ncentral power of Assyria was distracted or deployed elsewhere.\nOthers tried imposing an Assyrian governor on the Babylonians.\nThis naturally enraged them, and these Assyrian kings of Babylon would often\nface plots and rebellions, and would quite often be toppled in favor of some\nBabylonian noble who would then immediately declare independence.\nThe third option was to keep the throne of Babylon in the family.\nThis usually involved the king of Assyria crowning his brother or uncle as\nthe king of Babylon, but this held another danger.\nIf this brother was a little too ambitious, he might consider using the\nmight of Babylon as a springboard to try and take the whole empire for himself.\nBy the year 694 BC, this repeated cycle and seemingly impossible problem had\nbecome too much for King Sennacherib, and for him, the conflict had become personal.\nBabylonian rebels were partly responsible for the death of one of his\nsons, and after crushing his enemies in the\nnorth in the Kingdom of Judah and along the Mediterranean coast, he swung around\nand set out on campaign to decisively beat the city of Babylon and solve the\nBabylonian problem for good. In the year 689 BC, the Assyrians laid\nsiege to Babylon. The siege lasted for 15 months, and when\nthe city finally fell, Sennacherib wrote this description of what happened next. I destroyed the city and its houses from\nfoundation to parapets. I devastated and burned them. I razed\nthe brick and earthen work of the outer and inner wall of the city, of the\ntemples, and of the ziggurat, and I dumped these into the Arahtu canal.\nI dug canals through the midst of that city. I overwhelmed it with water. I made\nits very foundations disappear, and I destroyed it more completely than a\ndevastating flood so that it might be impossible in future days to recognize\nthe sight of that city and its temples. I utterly dissolved it with water\nand made it like an inundated land. Even by the standards of the time, this\naction was considered excessive. Burning a Judean or Elamite city to the\nground was one thing, but to do the same to the cultured,\nancient, and holy city of Babylon was too much.\nThere was a great outcry in Assyria, and Sennacherib responded by kidnapping the\nBabylonian god Marduk, carrying him back to Nineveh, and placing him on trial.\nWe can imagine the scenes as a group of Assyrian legal officials gathered in\ncourt to condemn the silent stone statue of the god.\nMarduk was eventually found guilty, but the broken text recounting this\nepisode gives no clue about what punishment was handed down.\nSennacherib's goal had been to utterly destroy Babylon,\nand he had succeeded. Its northern provinces were folded into\nthe Assyrian Empire, and the city itself was left in ruins. The war in Babylon seems to have drained\nsomething from King Sennacherib. After destroying the ancient city, he no\nlonger seems to have had any appetite for war.\nInstead of destruction, he dedicated the later years of his reign to building.\nHe settled down in the city of Nineveh and named it his new capital.\nNineveh had been an important city for millennia, but when Sennacherib moved\nthere, it was in a sorely neglected state. He renovated its palaces and built new\nones, decorating them with carvings of his early victories like the one at the\nsiege of Lachish, as the following inscription recounts. I had a palace built with elephant ivory,\nebony, boxwood, cedar, cypress, juniper, and terebinth,\na palace that I named The Palace Without A Rival.\nI roofed its rooms with beams of cedar grown on Mount Amanus. I fastened bands\nof shining bronze on magnificent doors of cypress, whose scent is sweet on opening\nand closing. I installed eight striding lions\nstanding opposite one another, which were made from 11,400\ntalents of shining copper cast by the god Ninagal, and were filled with\nradiance. One inscription on a stone lion in the\nquarter associated with Sennacherib's queen, named Tashmetu-sharrat, contains\nhopes that the royal couple would both live long and healthy lives within the\nnew palace. Sennacherib constructed beautiful gardens\nat his new palace, importing various plants and herbs from across his empire\nand beyond. Cotton trees may have been imported from as far\naway as India, and it's been suggested that the famous Hanging Gardens of\nBabylon, one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, may actually have been\nthese gardens in Nineveh, which were designed to represent the empire in\nminiature form. Sennacherib recounts these efforts in\nthe following inscription. I planted alongside the palace a\nbotanical garden, a replica of Mount Amanus which has all kinds of aromatic\nplants and fruit trees, trees that are the mainstay of the mountains and Chaldea,\ncollected inside it. By the end of Sennacherib's reign,\nNineveh must have shone, a resplendent city fit for the world's mightiest\nempire. I think in this change we see in\nSennacherib, we see a possible different path that history might have taken.\nThe war-like king who had torn down the walls of Lachish and burned Babylon to\nthe ground now seemed to turn away from battle.\nHe settled down and began building instead.\nIf this really indicates a change of personality in this Assyrian king,\nthe tragedy is that he would not live to pass on this spirit to his sons. Sennacherib had at least seven sons,\nbut when the crown prince, the oldest of them all, died in battle against the\nElamites, Sennacherib was left to choose between the remaining younger sons who\nwould be the next king. In the end, he had to decide between only\ntwo candidates. These two sons were named Udru-Mulissu\nand Esarhaddon. For Sennacherib, this seems to have been a difficult\ndecision. At first, the older son Udru-Mulissu was\nnamed the crown prince, but after a few years, he seems to have fallen out of\nfavor with his father. We can only guess what it was that made\nthe king change his mind, but considering what would go on to\nhappen, we might offer a guess. It may be that Sennacherib detected\nsomething cold and hard in the character of Udru-Mulissu,\na hunger for power that frightened him. Whatever it was, Sennacherib decided to\nname the youngest of his sons as crown prince instead,\nthe man named Esarhaddon. Esarhaddon's brothers were enraged.\nIn a later inscription, he recalls the effect this announcement had on them.\nI am my older brother's youngest brother, but by the command of the gods,\nmy father elevated me firmly in the assembly of my brothers,\nsaying this is the son who will succeed me.\nHe questioned the god Samas and Adad by divination, and they answered him with\na firm yes,\nsaying he is your replacement.\nHe heeded their important words and gathered together the people of Assyria,\nyoung and old, and my brothers,\nand told them. Afterwards, my brothers went out of their\nminds and did everything that is displeasing to the gods of mankind, and\nthey plotted evil. They butted each other like goats for\nthe right to exercise kingship, and then\nmy brothers went mad. They drew their swords godlessly in the\nmiddle of Nineveh. The other brothers begged their father\nto reconsider, but King Sennacherib's mind was made up.\nUdru-Mulissu was forced to swear an oath of allegiance to his brother.\nWe know the kind of thing this oath would have contained because we have\nsurviving copies of this kind of treaty that Assyrian kings always sent out to\ntheir vassals. These were long legal documents running\nover many pages containing an oath in which they swore their loyalty to the\nnew crown prince, complete with terrifying heavenly\npunishments if they broke their word. This is the treaty which the king of\nAssyria has concluded with you in the presence of the great gods of\nheaven and earth. If you should remove it, consign it to\nthe fire, throw it into the water, bury it in the earth or destroy it by any\ncunning device, annihilate or deface it, may Anu,\nking of the gods, let disease, exhaustion, malaria, sleeplessness, worries, and ill\nhealth reign upon all your houses, clothe you with leprosy, and forbid your\nentering into the presence of the gods or king roam the desert like the wild\nass and the gazelle. May Shamash, the light of heaven and\nearth, remove your eyesight. Walk about in darkness. May Ishtar, lady\nof battle and war, smash your bow in the thick of battle. May Nabu, bearer of the\ntablet of fates of the gods, erase your name\nand destroy your seed from the land. But still, the bitter former crown prince\nUdru-Mulissu refused to accept it. Esarhaddon's brothers began plotting to\nhave him killed, forcing him to flee to the western\nregions far from the increasingly dangerous atmosphere in Nineveh.\nEsarhaddon later remembers this exile with bitterness.\nThey started evil rumors, falsehoods, and slander about me against the will of the\ngods, and they were constantly telling insincere lies, hostile things behind my\nback. They alienated the well-meaning heart of\nmy father from me against the will of the gods,\nbut deep down he was compassionate, and his eyes were permanently fixed on me\nexercising kingship. Esarhaddon's escape from Nineveh\nprobably saved his life, but his father Sennacherib failed to see\nthe danger that was increasingly growing against his own person.\nOn the twentieth day of Tebet, the tenth month of the Assyrian calendar in the\nyear 681 BC, the snubbed oldest prince Urdu-Mulissu, accompanied by another\nbrother, fell upon the king Sennacherib while\nhe prayed in one of Nineveh's temples, and killed him.\nThe death of Sennacherib sent shockwaves across the whole region.\nIn Judah and in all the other places where the Assyrians were despised, people\nmust have celebrated in the streets. But in Assyria, the murder of the king\nwas an abomination. The treacherous prince Udru-Mulissu and\nthe other brothers had miscalculated the strength of the reaction against them.\nRiding this tide of outrage, the crown prince Esarhaddon quickly gathered an\narmy and marched out to meet his treacherous brothers in battle.\nThey also mustered a mighty force, but on the eve of the first battle, the\nsoldiers of the brothers deserted en masse,\nunwilling to fight for the men who had murdered the old king.\nEsarhaddon now marched on Nineveh, facing virtually no resistance.\nOne of his later inscriptions recalls his emotion upon retaking the city where\nhis father had been murdered. I entered into Nineveh,\nmy royal city, joyful, and took my seat upon the throne\nof my father in safety. The south wind blew,\nthe breath of Ea, the wind whose blowing is favorable for\nexercising kingship. They awaited me favorable signs in\nheaven and on earth, a message of the soothsayers, tidings\nfrom the gods and goddesses, giving my heart\ncourage. Esarhaddon's rage against the\nconspirators was overwhelming. He quickly moved to execute all of their\naccomplices and the entire families of his brothers,\nas one chilling inscription recounts. I sought out every one of the guilty\nsoldiers who wrongly incited my brothers to exercise kingship over\nAssyria, and imposed a grievous punishment on them.\nI exterminated their offspring. Esarhaddon had retaken the throne that\nhis father had left for him, but the way he was forced to take it\nforever scarred the young king. The rest of his life he lived in a cloud\nof paranoia, never knowing who he could trust.\nMessages written on clay tablets show that he frequently sought the\nadvice of oracles and priests, asking them whether any of his relatives\nor officials wished to harm him. He spent much of his time in a heavily\nfortified palace in the city of Kalhu, with high walls and only one entrance\nand exit, designed to be impregnable to assassins.\nPerhaps fearing that the gods were angry with him, Esarhaddon also set out to\nundo some of the damage that his warlike father had done.\nHe especially wanted to repair relations with the southern metropolis of Babylon\nafter the destruction that his father Sennacherib had wrought on it.\nHe ordered that various statues of Babylonian gods should be returned to\ntheir rightful home, and in the year 680 BC, he announced that\nhe would rebuild the ancient city. Many letters written between King\nEsarhaddon and his chief architects have survived,\nand in them we get a clear sense that he wanted to rebuild Babylon just as it had\nbeen before the destruction. I laid its foundation platform over its\nprevious foundations, and in exact accordance with this earlier plan.\nI did not diminish it by one cubit or increase it by half a cubit.\nI drew its grand plan exactly as it had been written.\nI made its foundation platform as strong as the base of a mighty mountain,\nand built its structure as it was in former days. Esarhaddon's rebuilding was a clear\nmessage to Babylon's people, and if reports are to be believed, it\nseems the Babylonians were grateful for the work done on their city.\nOne message written by the governor that Esarhaddon installed in Babylon gives a\nglowing impression. I have entered Babylon.\nThe people of Babylon welcomed me, and they blessed the king every day, saying\nhe is the one who returned Babylon's captives and booty.\nAlso, the chiefs of Chaldea from Sippar to the mouth of the sea blessed the king,\nsaying he is the one who resettled\nBabylon. But Esarhaddon was also a fierce war-maker.\nHe even invaded Egypt, sick and tired of their activities funding and supporting\nrebels in Assyrian lands. His first campaign in 673 BC was an\nembarrassing failure, but he succeeded with another push two years later.\nOne victory monument put up in the south of modern Turkey proclaimed the totality\nof his victory. Memphis, his royal city, in half a day\nwith mines, tunnels,\nassaults, I besieged, I captured, I destroyed, I devastated,\nI burned with fire. But around this time, Esarhaddon's\nhealth began to deteriorate. It's not exactly clear what his illness\nwas, but I think there's a good argument to\nbe made that this Assyrian king was suffering\nfrom one of the first recorded cases of depression.\nThe king would often spend days in his sleeping quarters without food, drink, or\nhuman contact, and matters were made much worse when\nhis queen, the great love of his life, passed away.\nEsarhaddon began writing letters to his chief exorcist and medicine man,\na person named Adad-shumu-usur. This man was the one most responsible\nfor Esarhaddon's wellbeing, and he often replied with hopelessness to the\nking's constant requests, as this letter written by him to the\nking shows. As to what the king,\nmy lord, wrote to me, I'm feeling very sad.\nHow did we act that I have become so depressed for this little one of mine?\nHad it been curable, you would have given away half of your\nkingdom to have it cured, but what can we do?\nOh, king, my lord,\nit is something that cannot be done. Letters preserved from Esarhaddon's\nroyal court describe his condition in some detail.\nHe suffered violent vomiting, constant fevers, nosebleeds, and dizziness,\npainful earaches, and melancholy. The king often feared that his death was\nnear, and a rash began to cover most of his body, including his face.\nHis royal physicians could do nothing to help him, and they often wrote\ndespondently back to him. The king, my lord, keeps on saying to me\nwhy do you not diagnose the nature of this illness of mine and bring about its\ncure? I spoke to the king at the audience and\ncould not clarify his symptoms. As Esarhaddon's death neared,\nthe question of his succession became a pressing concern.\nHe had seen firsthand what a civil war over the throne could do to tear the\nempire apart, and he wanted to do everything he could\nto ensure a smooth transition. Determined not to repeat his father's\nmistakes, Esarhaddon decided on an inventive course of action.\nHe would name one of his young sons the king of Assyria,\nruling the whole empire from Nineveh, and another son he would name the king of\nBabylon, who would rule over that city, swearing an oath to the Assyrian Empire.\nIn Babylon, he appointed his eldest surviving son Shamash-shum-ukin,\nand in Nineveh to be the king of the whole empire in his place, he appointed a\nyounger son named Ashurbanipal. It was a beautiful vision;\ntwo brothers ruling over the world's two greatest\ncities together, the two of them uniting these two cities,\nbringing in an age of peace and prosperity.\nIt was a beautiful vision, but a mistaken one.\nIn fact, Esarhaddon's miscalculation would backfire enormously, and the war he\ncaused would usher in the final chapter of the Assyrian age. One day in the year 670 BC, in the city\nof Harran in northern Mesopotamia, a woman fell into an ecstatic fit\nand began speaking in tongues. She ran through the street and shouted\nout for all to hear a clear and unmistakable prophecy. A slave girl of Bel-ahu-usur in the\nsuburb of Harran; since the month of Sivan she is\nenraptured and speaks these prophecies about him.\nIt is the word of Nusku. I will destroy the name and seed of\nSennacherib. King Esarhaddon's network of spies soon\ndelivered this information to him, and he was appalled at the news.\nHe immediately ordered a crackdown across the empire,\nburning the homes of anyone found to be spreading this conspiracy,\nbut the news of the prophecy does seem to have shaken him.\nDuring the final years of his life, Esarhaddon became obsessed with omens and\nprophecies, and his court astrologers spent a lot of their time reassuring him,\nas this letter from one of them shows. The eclipse of the moon moved from the\neastern quadrant and settled over the entire western quadrant to the moon.\nThe planets Jupiter and Venus were visible during the eclipse until it\ncleared. This is fortunate for your majesty, and\nportends evil for your enemies in the westland.\nBecause of the dark omens seeming to gather around him, Esarhaddon undertook\na number of times a bizarre ritual known as the substitute king. The substitute king ritual involved the\nAssyrian monarch going into hiding for a hundred days, during which a substitute\nwas found to take his place. This was often a commoner, and he would\nspend those hundred days living in the palace, sleeping in the king's bed,\nwearing his crown and royal clothes, and eating his food. During this time, the\nactual king remained hidden, and even took on the title \u201cthe farmer\u201d to try to\nfool the evil spirits out to harm him. At the end of the hundred days, having\nabsorbed whatever negative energy was out to get the king, the substitute was\nput to death and the real monarch was returned to the throne,\nthe evil supposedly having passed him by. Esarhaddon repeated this ritual three\ntimes during the final years of his reign,\nshowing just how desperate he was to shake the feeling of doom that had begun\nto gather around him. But it was no use.\nAfter a rebellion in Egypt, Esarhaddon marched out to fight against those who\nopposed him, and on the way,\nhis health worsened. His condition became critical as his\narmy passed through the north of Mesopotamia, and he died in the town of\nHarran. This was the same town where only a few\nyears before, the woman had run through the streets,\nshouting in ecstasy about the prophecy of his doom. When Esarhaddon died, his sons\nAshurbanipal and Shamash-shum-ukin successfully ascended the thrones of\nAssyria and Babylon, and began the twin rule that their father had planned.\nThis began as a remarkable success. Shamash-shum-ukin\njourneyed to Babylon and brought with him the statue of Marduk that his\ngrandfather had put on trial, the last artifact that remained to be returned to\nBabylon. The two princes took up their thrones\nwithout any turmoil or unrest, and at first it seemed like the old\nking's plan was about to usher in a new age of peace.\nBut for a number of reasons, that peace wasn't to last. The reign of Ashurbanipal is without\ndoubt the golden age of the Assyrian Empire.\nAt the time of his reign, it was the largest empire that the world had ever\nseen, and its capital of Nineveh was probably the largest city on the planet.\nThe king Ashurbanipal himself springs out of the historical sources as a fully\nformed character, full of his own preoccupations and\nobsessions. One of the most interesting aspects of\nhis character is that he was possibly the first Assyrian king to be able to\nread. Up until this time, reading wasn't\nconsidered a particularly kingly activity.\nKings had servants and scribes to do their reading for them, and rulers were\nsupposed to take part in more manly pursuits like hunting and fighting.\nBut Ashurbanipal hadn't been intended for the throne.\nBefore being named the crown prince, he had been preparing for some kind of\nposition in the temples, and this meant he was taught to read from a young age.\nIt's something he was clearly quite proud of, as this inscription written by\nhim attests. I,\nAshurbanipal, understood the wisdom of Nabu, the god of learning,\nall the art of writing of every kind. I made myself the master of them all.\nI read the cunning tablets of Sumer and the dark Akkadian language which is\ndifficult to rightly use. I took my pleasure in reading stones\ninscribed before the flood, such works as none of the kings who went\nbefore me had ever learnt. I wrote on tablets, checked and collated,\nand deposited within my palace for perusing and reading.\nAshurbanipal's collection of clay tablets was something quite\nunprecedented in the world at the time. It was the first attempt to create a\nuniversal library, a place where all the books ever written could be kept.\nHe wrote to cities and centers of learning all across the empire,\nrequesting copies of every written work ever set in clay.\nEventually, he would amass a collection of over 30,000 clay tablets.\nMost were observations of events and omens,\ntexts detailing the behavior of certain peoples and animals, texts on the\nmovements of heavenly bodies, the planets, and stars.\nBut the library also contained dictionaries for the languages of\nSumerian, Akkadian, and others, as well as religious texts, rituals, fables, prayers,\nand incantations, even comical satirical pieces of writing, as well as the great\nancient mythology and poetry of Mesopotamia.\nMany of the traditional Mesopotamian stories and tales known today, among them\nthe epic of Gilgamesh, have only survived into the modern day because they were\nincluded in Ashurbanipal's library. But Ashurbanipal would soon have to deal\nwith the very real challenges of ruling the Assyrian Empire.\nEgypt, Assyria's newest imperial possession, was already in full rebellion,\nand so in the year 667 BC, Ashurbanipal marched the Assyrian army as far south\nas Thebes and sacked numerous Egyptian cities in classic Assyrian fashion.\nThis campaign crushed the insurgency, but as usual, it only created more resistance\nin the long term. Rebellions sprang up once again the very\nnext year, forcing him to march back to Egypt and stamp it out even harder.\nBut despite his efforts, the Assyrians would never successfully integrate Egypt\ninto their empire. At this time, another power on the\nopposite side of the empire began to become an increasingly painful\nthorn in the side of Assyria. These were the Elamite peoples of\nsouthern Iran. The Elamites were an ancient people.\nThey had been instrumental in the fall of Sumerian society more than a\nmillennium before, and since then had built a powerful and wealthy kingdom\ncentered on the capital of Suza. The people of Elam had clashed with the\nAssyrians a number of times, and today their border is more or less in the same\nplace as the modern border between Iraq and Iran.\nAshurbanipal's father Esarhaddon had taken pains to exist peacefully with\nthe people of Elam, and even allowed outbursts of violence on the border to\ngo unpunished. Now, Elam was growing in confidence.\nWithout much hope of defeating Assyria on the battlefield, they had settled for\na similar tactic as the Egyptians in dealing with their powerful neighbor,\nsupplying and arming rebel groups in Assyria,\nand causing as much trouble for them as they could without provoking an all-out\nwar. But in the year 653 BC, it's thought that\nthe Elamite king, a man named Teumann, received a secret\nmessage. This message was from the older brother\nof King Ashurbanipal, then ruling as the king of Babylon as their father had\ndecreed, the man named Shamash- -shum-ukin. Shamash-shum-ukin\nhad been dissatisfied with his lot in life for a long time\nnow. Since their father's death 13 years before, he had ruled as king of Babylon\nwhile his brother ruled over the whole empire.\nHe must have had a pretty good life, but he didn't feel all that powerful.\nIn theory, he ruled over all of Babylonia, but in practice, most of his governors\nsimply ignored him and considered Ashurbanipal to be their true\nking. Inscriptions show that Ashurbanipal would often dictate orders to him and\nwould frequently meddle in the affairs of Babylon.\nHis anger at this situation was clearly growing, and if he did send a message to\nTeumann, the king of Elam, we can imagine that it contained a clear proposition.\nI will help you invade Assyria, topple Ashurbanipal, and destroy your ancient\nrival, and in return I want to rule over\nBabylon as its only king. The Elamites were all too eager to\naccept. When the season of war came back around\nin the year 664, the Elamites launched a surprise attack.\nThey swept down from the mountains and attacked the Assyrian\u2019s southern\nterritories. Ashurbanipal was enraged. He gathered his\narmies and marched down the rivers to face them.\nHe successfully repelled their attack and chased their soldiers back into\nElam. He defeated them in battle beside the\nriver Ulay, close to their capital of Suza, and one\nof Ashurbanipal's inscriptions boasts about this victory, which is also\nimmortalized in a series of carvings that were displayed on his palace walls. By the command of the gods Ashur and\nMarduk, I blocked up the Ulay River with their corpses and filled the plane of\nthe city Suza with their bodies like water weeds.\nIn the midst of his troops, I cut off the head of Teumann, the king of the land Elam. One remarkable carving\neven depicts the king Ashurbanipal relaxing in his gardens with his queen,\nsurrounded by musicians and servants fanning him, bringing him drinks and food,\nand all the while the head of his conquered enemy Teumann hangs in the\nbranches of a nearby tree. It's not clear whether Ashurbanipal\nsuspected his brother's hand in the surprise attack.\nEither way, one year later, Shamash-shum-ukin\nrevealed his true intentions. He rose his armies in rebellion against\nhis brother, and declared the lands of Babylonia to be independent. This clearly shook King Ashurbanipal.\nWe can almost hear the betrayal, the hurt, and the anger speaking directly from his\nofficial inscriptions. Shamash-shum-ukin, my unfaithful brother, for whom I\nperformed many acts of kindness and whom I had installed as king of Babylon, I\nmade and gave him everything that kingship calls for. I assembled soldiers,\nhorses, and chariots, and placed them in his hands.\nI gave him more cities, fields, orchards, and people to live inside them than the\nfather who had engendered me had commanded.\nHe forgot these acts of kindness that I had done for him, and constantly sought\nout evil deeds. Aloud with his lips he was speaking\nfriendship, but deep down his heart was scheming for murder.\nHe lied to the citizens of Babylon who had been devoted to Assyria, servants who\nbelonged to me, and he spoke words of deceit with them. But privately, Ashurbanipal was clearly\nafraid. He frequently wrote messages to his\noracles and soothsayers, giving them questions that he wanted to ask the gods,\nand in these questions we get a remarkable sense for the uncertainties\nand doubts that plagued him during these dark days.\nWill the Elamite army gather, get organized, march, and fight with the men\nand army of Ashurbanipal, king of Assyria? His fears were soon realized, and the\nElamite army, still stinging from their defeat the previous year, joined with his\nbrother to fight him. Ashurbanipal responded by marching with\nhis full force on the city of Babylon. His brother Shamash-shum-ukin\nwas forced to retreat behind its mighty walls, and the Assyrians settled in for a\nsiege. The siege of Babylon went on for four\nyears. Conditions within the city of Babylon\nbecame horrific during this time. People began to starve and resort to\ncannibalism. When the city finally fell, the Assyrian\nsoldiers poured over its walls and into its streets.\nShamash-shum-ukin himself appears to have died in a fire,\nalthough it's not clear how it was started.\nThe citizens of the city who had held out for so long under horrific\nconditions were cut down by the Assyrian soldiers,\nas Ashurbanipal's inscriptions recall. Those of them who fled before the\nmurderous iron dagger, famine, want and flaming fire, and found a refuge; the net\nof the great gods, my lords, which cannot be eluded, brought them low.\nNot one escaped. Not one sinner slipped through my hands.\nAs for those men and their vulgar mouths who uttered vulgarity against Ashur, my\ngod, and plotted evil against me, I slit their tongues and brought them\nlow. The rest of those living I destroyed, and\ntheir carved-up bodies I fed to dogs, to pigs, to wolves, to eagles, to birds of the\nheavens, to fishes of the deep. After all his father Esarhaddon's\nefforts to rebuild Babylon, Ashurbanipal had now turned it back into ruin. With his vengeance on Babylon complete,\nAshurbanipal turned his attention to Elam.\nIn the next year, he marched up into the mountains,\nbut this time he would not simply punish Elam.\nThis campaign was waged as a war of extermination, designed to utterly remove\nit as a political entity in its entirety. Carried by wounded rage, Ashurbanipal\nscattered the armies of Elam and rounded on its capital city of Suza.\nOne Assyrian carving shows what happened next.\nIt shows the city of Suza in the background.\nFlames are rising from its towers and pouring out the mouth of its gate.\nIn the foreground, Assyrian soldiers are carrying off all kinds of loot, and on\nthe walls and towers of Suza, more soldiers are steadily and meticulously\ngoing to work demolishing every building in the city brick by brick. Ashurbanipal,\nin one of his inscriptions, describes the destruction he ordered.\nSuza, the great holy city, abode of their gods, seat of their\nmysteries, I conquered. I entered its palaces, I opened their\ntreasuries where silver and gold, goods and wealth were amassed.\nI destroyed the ziggurat of Suza. I smashed its shining copper horns.\nI reduced the temples of Elam to naught. Their gods and goddesses I scattered to\nthe winds. The tombs of their ancient and recent\nkings I devastated. I exposed to the sun and I carried away\ntheir bones toward the land of Ashur. I devastated the provinces of Elam, and on\ntheir lands I sowed salt. The Assyrians had once more emerged\nvictorious, their army undefeated,\nall challenges overcome, and now one of their oldest rivals\nutterly eradicated. The empire was at the height of its\nconfidence, but in little over 30 years, its end\nwould come, and all that would be left would be a\nseries of enormous smoking ruins crumbling into the desert sands. It's in the final decade of his reign,\nperhaps around the year 640 BC, that King Ashurbanipal commissioned the works of\nart that would stand as perhaps the defining and lasting legacy of his\nentire civilization. These are the lion hunt reliefs of the\nnorthwest palace in Nineveh. At this time, a breed of lion known as\nthe Asiatic lion roamed freely right across the Middle East.\nThey are slightly smaller than their African counterparts, with a much shorter\nmane and a distinctive fold of skin running down their bellies.\nAlthough we think of them today as endangered animals to be protected, lions\nwere a constant menace for the people of Assyria.\nThey would often roam down from the hills and take away livestock,\nand they could be a very real danger to the people.\nThis letter, written by a panicking servant to his master who's away from\nthe house on business, shows how prevalent this danger could be. Tell my lord your servant Yakim-Addu\nsends the following message. A short time ago I wrote to my lord as\nfollows; a lion was caught in the loft of a house in Akkaka. My lord should write me\nwhether this lion should remain in that same loft until the arrival of my lord\nor whether I should have it brought to my lord, but letters from my lord were\nslow in coming, and the lion has been in the loft for five days. Although they\nthrew him a dog and a pig, he refused to eat them.\nI was worrying; heaven forbid that this lion pine away.\nI became scared, but eventually I got the lion into a wooden cage and loaded it on\na boat to have it brought to my lord. The kings of Assyria had hunted lions\nfor centuries, and the killing of these creatures had taken on a symbolic\nmeaning. For the kings of Assyria, the lion came\nto represent all the dangers that menaced their people, and by triumphing\nover a lion, they were shown to be capable of protecting their people from\nall other dangers. In the early days, these hunts would take\nthe form of expeditions out into the wilderness to find wild lions in the\nhills, but in the later years of the empire, lions were rounded up from the\ncountryside and brought to the capital to be bred in captivity,\nas one inscription by the 9th century king Ashurnasirpal recounts.\nWith my outstretched hand and my fierce heart, I captured 15 strong lions from\nthe mountains and forests. I took away fifty lion cubs.\nI herded them into Kalhu and the palaces of my land into cages.\nI bred their cubs in great numbers. These lions could be hunted in more\ncontrolled performances in full view of all the city's\ninhabitants, and it's one of these incredible\nspectacles that the lion hunt reliefs portray.\nWe can see the king in his chariot fighting with spear and bow.\nWe can see the lions in their cages with a small person or child in a smaller\ncage above, tasked with the job of opening the cage door. We can see the\nsoldiers penning in the lions with shields and spears, with trained dogs\nstraining on their leashes. We can imagine the thunder of the king's\nchariot as it rides around the arena, and the whistling of his arrows as they find\ntheir mark. These reliefs show the craft of the\nAssyrians at its most realistic, and demonstrate an art form that had matured\nover centuries. The immaculate details in the human figures in the embroidered\nclothes and the details of the chariot, even the fingernails and eyelashes of\nthe figures are all realized in perfect detail. But while the human figures are\ndepicted formally with little or no emotion on their faces, it's these lions\nthat carry almost a human expressiveness. As the arrows and spears strike them, the\nfaces of the lions seem to cry out with human sorrow,\nand it can be tempting as a modern observer to see in that sorrow a\ndistillation of the mood that must have been enveloping the empire in its final\nyears as things began to crumble around it.\nThese would be the last great pieces of art to ever be created in the empire of\nAssyria in the final years of its last great king.\nWithin little more than three decades, the empire of Assyria would collapse,\nand all of its great cities would be abandoned to the sands. As is always the case, there were\nmultiple causes of the Assyrian collapse, and the latest research\nsuggests that one of these was something we've encountered a number of times\nthroughout this series. That's a rapid and dramatic climate\nshift. In the south of Mesopotamia,\nwhat was then the lands of Babylon, the land is arid, broken only by the rivers\nand marshland, while in the north there is a great deal\nof rainfall in the winter. This means that in the south, vast networks of\nirrigation canals have been necessary since the earliest Sumerian days.\nBut in the north, irrigation was less of a concern,\nsince the seasonal rains were able to water the crops.\nThe last 200 years had been a time of unusually high rainfall.\nBut new studies of stalagmites in the Kuna Ba caves of northern Iraq have\nsuggested that around the year 675 BC, in the final years of the reign of King\nEsarhaddon, this situation began to change. Stalagmites are rock formations that\nform slowly as mineral deposits drip down from the roofs of caves.\nThis means that they grow outwards, leaving rings just like the rings of a\ntree. Studying the chemical composition of\nthese rings can tell us a lot about how the climate changed over the course of\ntheir formation, and these stalagmites clearly show that\nthere were two distinct phases in the climate of the Assyrian age.\nThe first was one of the wettest periods of the whole 4,000-year span that the\nstalagmites show. During this time, Assyrian fields would\nhave been thick with barley and wheat, its grazing lands rich and capable of\nsupporting huge herds of animals. But this phase came to an end around 725 BC,\njust before King Ashurbanipal came to the throne.\nThis second period was marked by increasingly dry conditions.\nIn fact, the region was soon gripped by a mega drought. Even today with all our modern farming\ntechniques, crop productivity in northern Iraq is\nhighly sensitive to small changes in rainfall,\nand it's possible that a protracted period of drought may have acted to\nweaken the imperial center of Assyria. There is some evidence that during the\ndecades of drought, the people of the north began to dig irrigation canals of\nthe kind more usually found in the dry south,\nsuggesting that the rains were becoming increasingly unreliable.\nBut there's little evidence to be found in historical texts,\nand no real mention of devastating droughts.\nAfter all, drought was one of the problems that Assyrians had learned to\ndeal with expertly. Records show that the prices of grain\nand slaves remained relatively stable throughout this period, meaning that the\npicture wasn't one of starvation or people dying in the streets.\nBut it's still worth bearing in mind that the Assyrian state was now under\npressure from its environment and were suddenly put at an economic disadvantage\nto their southern neighbors. Whether this was a major factor in their\ndownfall is still subject to lively debate,\nbut I think another factor is perhaps the most important.\nAssyria was perhaps the first true military superpower. Their military was\neasily the most powerful in the region, a hammer that crushed all opposition,\nbut their heavy-handed approach to maintaining their empire made them\nincredibly unpopular. This meant their subject peoples were\nconstantly on the verge of rebellion, and whenever this happened, the Assyrians did\nthe only thing they knew how; crush the rebellions even harder and\nmake themselves even more hated. Eventually, they were left with no other\noption but the kind of thing Ashurbanipal did to the lands of Elam,\nto crush their enemies so ruthlessly that they simply ceased to exist.\nBut nature abhors a vacuum, and beyond the blackened and smoking lands of Elam,\nanother power had been building for centuries, just waiting for their\nopportunity to expand, an opportunity that the Assyrians had\njust dropped right into their laps. These were the people of Medea, who were\ncalled the Medes. The Medes were an ancient Iranian people\nwho spoke the Medean language and lived in the region of northern and western\nIran. For centuries now, the powerful Elamites\nhad been their rivals and kept their ambitions in check,\nbut with the Elamites now virtually eradicated, that was no longer the case.\nIn the next decades, the Medeans expanded rapidly and moved to occupy the lands of\nElam, gathering its scattered and angry\npeoples beneath its banner. Soon they were a formidable force, and\nthey were all animated with a common purpose; a burning hatred for the\nAssyrian Empire and everything it stood for.\nAll they would need was an opening, and that opening would come in the form of\nthe death of the great king Ashurbanipal. For someone whose early life was so\nmeticulously recorded and who professed his love of literature and writing,\nthe final 12 years of Ashurbanipal's reign are a surprising mystery.\nWe don't actually know how he died or really how he spent the last decade of\nhis life. It's possible that the king was struck\nwith a period of illness, or like his father, he fell to the family\ntendency for depression and paranoia. One inscription, possibly the last ever\nwritten by Assyria's last great king, does seem to represent a kind of lament,\na wail of pain for the misfortunes that have befallen him.\nIt stands out among all the boasting and bluster of the Assyrian kings as a true\nmoment of vulnerability and suffering speaking up to us through the ages. I did well unto god and man,\nto dead and living. Why have sickness and misery befallen me?\nI cannot do away with the strife in my country and the dissensions in my family.\nDisturbing scandals oppress me always. Illness of mind and flesh\nbow me down. With cries of woe, I bring my days to an\nend. On the day of the city god, the day of\nthe festival, I am wretched.\nDeath is seizing hold upon me and bears me down.\nWith lamentation and mourning, I wail day and night. I groan oh,\ngod, grant even to one who is impious that he may see the light. Whatever the cause,\nin the year 639 BC, the chronicles that had until then kept detailed records of\nthe life of the king suddenly stop. For this period, virtually the only\nsources we have to work from are the Bible and the writings of Herodotus, who\ncompiled his histories 200 years later, and for whom Mesopotamia was a distant\nand mysterious land. But one thing is clear;\nafter the death of Ashurbanipal, chaos began to reign in Assyria.\nThere was fighting in the streets, and all its provinces\nrose up in rebellion. Babylon once more declared independence,\nand civil war split the empire. In the year 616 BC, a series of\nBabylonian chronicles begins, and they tell the story of the final\ncollapse of Assyrian society. The great instigators of this downfall\nwould be the people who the Assyrians had so inadvertently helped.\nThese were their enemies waiting and watching in the hills,\nthe people of Medea. In a startling surprise attack, the\nMedean armies marched down through the foothills of the Zagros mountains and\ninvaded the lands of Assyria. First, they marched to the great ancient\ncapital of Ashur, birthplace of the Assyrian nation and the home of its god.\nThe Babylonian chronicles record what happened next.\nHe made an attack on the town and destroyed the city wall.\nHe inflicted a terrible massacre upon the greater part of the people,\nplundering it and carrying off prisoners from it. This victory must have rocked the\nancient world. This was the first time in centuries\nthat a city of the Assyrian heartlands had been captured and sacked, and it must\nhave sent a clear message to all of its enemies;\nthe empire of Assyria was weak, and with enough of a push, perhaps it\ncould even be toppled. One man heard this message loud and\nclear. He was one of the new kings of the\nindependent Babylon who had big plans for the ancient city he ruled, and his\nname was Nabo-polassar. Nabo-polassar was a curious character.\nWe don't know anything about his origins, but he refers to himself in his\ninscriptions using the phrase \u2018mar la mammana\u2019, or the son of a nobody.\nNo other Mesopotamian king had ever described himself in this way, and it\nshows that in the social upheaval of this period of chaos, some of the power\nof the nobility was being eroded, and men were rising from the ranks of the common\npeople to rule. When he heard about the Medean victory\nat Ashur, Nabo-polassar must have been overjoyed.\nHe had spent years fortifying his borders,\nstrengthening them for a conflict with Assyria that he knew must be around the\ncorner. But now, he began to dream of even bigger\nthings. He gathered his armies and marched to Ashur as fast as he could to\njoin forces with the Medes. The Babylonian armies arrived too late\nfor the fighting, but in the ruins of the Assyrian city of Ashur, they formalized\ntheir alliance. The Medean king Cyaraxes\nmarried his daughter Amytis to the Babylonian prince Nabu-kudurri-Usur,\nand they joined forces for war. This is the situation that had been the\nAssyrian nightmare for centuries, and it had finally come to pass.\nIts enemies had united against it at its moment of greatest weakness. For the rest of that year, the joint\nMedean and Babylonian forces pushed north up the river Euphrates,\nbut they found that even a wounded lion can still bite.\nThe Assyrian army, even in its weakened state, was still a formidable force and\nmade them pay for every inch of land. It wasn't until the year 612 BC,\na full two years after the invasion had begun, that the Medean army reached the\nwalls of Assyria's greatest city, the capital of Nineveh. We can only imagine how that army must\nhave felt, looking out over that great city,\nthe capital of the world, with its towering ziggurat, its glorious palaces,\nand its double line of defensive walls. The Babylonian chronicles record what\nhappened next. Cyaxeres ferried across the river and marched\nupstream on the embankment of the Tigris, and pitched camp against Nineveh.\nFrom the month Simanu till the month Abu,\nthree battles were fought. Then they made a great attack against\nthe city. We can see evidence of the fierce battle\nthat unfolded here, left in the archaeological record.\nExcavations in Nineveh's southeastern gate, the Halzi Gate, have found the\nground here littered with skeletons lying one on top of another on the\ncobbled pavement. The bodies of horses also litter this gateway, along with\ncountless iron spearheads and arrows. All of them are lying exactly where they\nfell, in the last ditch defense of the city\nover 2,600 years ago. The Babylonian chronicles recall the\nlast desperate attempts of the defenders. In the month of Abu, the city was seized,\nand a great defeat inflicted on the entire population.\nOn that day, Sin-shar-ishkun, the king of Assyria, fled.\nThe great spoil of the city and the temple they carried off.\nMany prisoners of the city, beyond counting, they carried away.\nThey turned the city into ruined hills and heaps of debris. The destruction of Nineveh was recorded\nby Hebrew scholars of the time with an understandable delight.\nOne vivid account has survived in the Hebrew Bible in a chapter known as the\nBook of Nahum, and in these lines we can almost hear\nthe sound and fury of the battle as the soldiers of Medea and Babylon rampaged\nthrough the streets of Nineveh. Chariots rush madly in the streets.\nThey jostle one against another. They run to and fro like the lightnings.\nThe shield of his mighty men is made red, and the valiant men are in scarlet.\nChariots of fire, of steel, in this day of his preparation and the cypress spears\nare made to quiver. Behold, I am against thee, said the lord of hosts, and I will burn her chariots in the\nsmoke, and the sword shall devour thy young\nlions. I will cut off thy prey from the earth, and the voice\nof thy messenger shall no more be heard. Woe to the bloody city. It is full of lies. The horsemen charging and the flashing sword and the glittering spear, and a multitude of slain, and a heap of carcasses.\nThere is no end of the corpses, and they stumble upon their corpses.\nAll thy fortresses shall be like fig trees with the first ripe figs. If they be\nshaken, they fall into the mouth of the eater. For Nahum, the destruction of Nineveh was a moral\njudgment on an empire that had wrought such suffering on the lands of others. The lord is a jealous and avenging god.\nThe lord avengeth and is full of wrath. The lord taketh vengeance on his\nadversaries and he reserveth wrath for his enemies.\nThe lord has given commandment concerning thee,\nthat no more of thy name be sown, for thou art become worthless.\nBehold, the gates of thy land are set wide open unto thine enemies.\nThe fire hath devoured thy bars. Oh, king of Syria,\nthy people are scattered upon the mountains and there is none to gather\nthem. There is no assuaging of thy hurt.\nThy wound is grievous. All that hear the report of thee,\nclap the hands over thee, for upon whom\nhas not thy wickedness past continually? By the end of the year 612 BC, the three\ngreat capitals of Assyria, Ashur, the religious heart, Nineveh, the\nadministrative center, and Nimrud, the military capital,\nall lay in ruins. The Medes made no attempt to occupy them,\nand instead set about destroying the cities with the same viciousness that\nthe Assyrians had once reserved for the cities of Elam.\nThe Assyrian king was killed in the battle,\nand one general named Ashur-Uballit seems to have held out a brave\nresistance to the invaders, gathering what remained of the Assyrian army\naround him. These were mostly troops brought back\nfrom Egypt who had arrived too late for the defense of Nineveh,\nbut they must have known that it was hopeless.\nThey shut themselves up in the town of Harran,\nand I wonder whether any of them remembered that this was the place where\na century before, that woman had given her prophecy of doom for the empire of\nAssyria. In 610 BC,\ntwo years after the sacking of Nineveh, the Medean armies finally marched on\nHarran and crushed what remained of Assyrian resistance.\nThe general Ashur-Uballit faded from history, and the empire of\nAssyria passed into dust. The Babylonian king Nabo-polassar wrote\nthe following inscriptions celebrating the destruction of his great enemy. As for the Assyrians,\nwho had ruled over the land of Akkad because of the hatred of the gods and\nhad made the people of the land suffer under its heavy yoke,\nI, the weak and powerless one who\nconstantly seeks out the lord of lords Marduk,\nwith the powerful strength of the gods Nabu and Marduk, my lords, I barred their\nfeet from the land of Akkad and had the Babylonians\ncast off their yoke. As he grew older, Nabo-polassar\nincreasingly relied on his son, the prince Nabu-kudurri-Usur,\nwho we know by the biblical name Nebuchadnezzer.\nHis reign would begin the line of Babylonian kings which would usher in\nthe next phase of history in this region, but the great cities of Assyria would\nnever be reoccupied. The ruins of Nineveh would have stood\nfor some time as smoking heaps of blackened rubble,\nits streets carpeted with bodies, but slowly the wind-blown desert sands\nwould have rolled over them. Its walls and houses were covered in\ndust and earth. The skeletons lying in its streets were\nburied by the sands. The great library of the king\nAshurbanipal was also buried. In a twist of ironic fate, it was the\ndestruction of Nineveh that ensured that its texts would survive.\nThe fires that tore through the city baked the clay,\nhardening it, and meaning that the writing on these tablets was just as\nsharp on the day they were unearthed by archaeologists as the day an Assyrian\nscribe wrote them twenty-six centuries in the past.\nThe people who destroyed Nineveh celebrated by rampaging through the\npalaces of Ashurbanipal, Esarhaddon, and Sennacherib.\nThey looted them of all their valuables, and celebrated by defacing some of the\ncarvings that lined the palace walls. They struck particularly at the carved\nfaces of the Assyrian kings, cracking the soft alabaster, and reveling\nin their destruction. But of all the carvings, those depicting\nthe lion hunt remained untouched. The sorrowful expressions of those\nhunted lions would have stared out with their sad eyes over the abandoned halls,\nonce so full of life, as the days and months rolled by. Ash and dust soon filled the rooms.\nEventually, the roof beams rotted and collapsed.\nGrasses would have begun to grow in the halls of the Assyrian kings.\nBirds and wild foxes would have made their homes among the ruins,\nand bluish tamarisk bushes would have soon filled up the corridors.\nHundreds of years later, when the Greek writer Xenophon marched past with his\n10,000 Greeks, fleeing from the Persian army that\npursued them, the people who lived in this region would not even remember the\nnames of the people who had built this city.\nThey would say only that it might have been the Medes\nand that for some reason, the gods had punished them and turned\ntheir cities into a mound of ruins. Writing in the 1850s,\nthe Victorian archaeologist Austen Henry Layard visited the ruins of Nineveh and\nwrote the following account of the sight of these desolate ruins. During a short stay in this town, we\nvisited the great ruins on the east bank of the river, which have been generally\nbelieved to be the remains of Nineveh. From the summit of an artificial\neminence, we looked down upon a broad plain\nseparated from us by the river. A line of lofty mounds bounded it to the\neast, and one of a pyramidical form rose high above the rest.\nIts position rendered its identification easy;\nthis was the pyramid which Xenophon had described, and near which the\n10,000 had encamped. The ruins around it were those which the\nGreek generals saw 22 centuries before, and which were,\neven then, the remains of an ancient city.\nLayard was struck with the haunting beauty of these empty places, where the\nruins hardly even seemed to bear the marks of human construction. Were the traveler to cross the Euphrates\nand seek for such ruins in Mesopotamia as he had left behind him in Asia Minor\nor Syria, his search would be in vain. The graceful\ncolumn rising above the thick foliage of tile myrtle, ilex, and oleander, the gradines\nof the amphitheater covering a gentle slope and overlooking the dark blue\nwater of a lake. None of this can be found.\nAll are replaced by the stern, shapeless mound\nrising like a hill from the scorched plain,\nthe fragments of pottery, and the stupendous mass of brickwork\noccasionally laid bare by the winter rains. Layard, like Xenophon more than two\nmillennia before, was struck by the immensity of what these ruins\nrepresented, their silent testimony to the vast gulf of time\nthat separates their time from ours. The scene around is\nworthy of the ruin he is contemplating. Desolation meets\ndesolation. A feeling of awe succeeds to wonder. There\nis nothing to relieve the mind, to lead to hope, or to tell of what has gone by.\nThese huge mounds of Assyria made a deeper impression upon me,\ngave rise to more serious thoughts and more earnest reflection than all the\ntemples of Balbec and the theatres of Ionia. It's only through the painstaking and\nmeticulous work of generations of scholars\nthat the texts of the ancient Assyrians have been slowly deciphered and\ntranslated, and their voices have once more been\nallowed to speak to us from the clay, breaking the silence of millennia. I want to end the episode with one of\nthese voices. It's a mysterious poem\nwritten by an unknown author in the language of Akkadian,\nand it's known as The Lament for a City. While these kinds of sorrowful laments\nwere common in the earlier language of Sumerian, they're less well-known in the\nAssyrian age. The poem speaks in the voice of a\ngoddess whose city has been destroyed, and who now wanders the bare and level\ndeserts alone, mourning for the place that she once\ncalled home. This poem, broken and fragmentary,\nfull of gaps and silences, captures what must have been the feeling of loss\nfelt in those days by all the peoples of Assyria.\nAs you listen, imagine what it would feel like to live in the rich heart of the\nworld, knowing that the final days of the empire stretched out before you.\nImagine how it would feel to live in the center of an empire that had caused so\nmuch suffering to others as the other peoples of the world\nfinally gathered around you and demanded their revenge.\nImagine how it would feel to watch the grand painted halls covered in carved\nalabaster, the gardens overflowing with rare trees and flowers,\nthe libraries full of books and stories, the city full of your memories of\nchildhood, your family and loved ones,\nall of it going up in flames and then covered\nfinally in the drifting dust and sand of the desert. Who stood where I stand to cry out,\nto cry out like a helpless one on her bed?\nAmong the established cities, my city has been smashed.\nAmong the established populace, my man has gone away.\nAmong the gods residing there, I too have surely fled.\nMy lost lamb cries out in the land of the enemy.\nMy lamb is bleating. My sheep and her lamb, they have been taken away.\nWhen my sheep crossed the river, she abandoned her lamb on the bank.\nMy birds, all of them with their wings cut off.\nWhere is my house that I used to dwell in?
