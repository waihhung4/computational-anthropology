"good afternoon or good evening wherever you may be listening in the world this is loow Montgomery once again with another edition of the China History Podcast as promised today is the first in a series of dynastic overviews from the first Chinese dynasty to the last I've been getting a lot of mail these past several days regarding doing shows chronologically and also sticking to the way I've been doing them up till now sort of jumping around in and out of different eras of Chinese history ancient and modern it looks like there's quite a lot of you out there who sort of liked it the way it was and we're going to keep it that way uh I don't want to appear wishy-washy or anything but what we'll do for now is introduce the dynasty starting with the SHA today and maybe go up to about the chin period I covered the Chin Dynasty in my first podcast episode when we looked at the first emperor of a unified China so we'll do both the dynastic overviews and also some other topics that might be of interest to you today we look at the Shia Dynasty this was the first dynasty of ch China and let me put air quotes around the word dynasty we're really digging deep deep deep into Chinese history and trust me when I say it's real Slim Pickins when it comes to material that can be trusted about this time period if not for the records of the grand historian and the bamboo annals there' hardly be anything to tell you except for the legends that are associated with this time even the time period isn't known I scoured the web my personal library and Google Books for anything and everything covering the Sha I found conflicting info on the period in question some said 2070 BC to 1600 BC 1989 to 1558 BC 2100 to 1600 BC 2205 to 1776 BC sort of all over the place some even say the first three dynasties all ran concurrently the Shia the Shang and the Joe like the tigress and Euphrates and mesop Amia the Indus River Valley in India and the Nile in Egypt China's earliest Beginnings were the product of a Great River Valley in this case the Yellow River the Yellow River is the world's sixth longest at 5,500 km although these days parts of it resemble a dry lake more than a river that's where it all began for China the Yellow River it was known by many nicknames but the one I always remember was China's sorrow jungong it wasn't a very deep River especially in the lower courses where our Story begins going back to the Cradle of Chinese civilization and for the next 4,000 years that followed the Hang H or Yellow River flooded 1500 to 1600 times and even changed course half a dozen times I first saw the Yellow River myself back in 1980 when I was in chinan in Shandong Province it's yellow is all I could say all that silt that originated in the plateaus out west give it that distinctive color if you don't mind I'm just going to LeapFrog all the Chinese Neolithic cultures and get right into the subject for today the Sha Dynasty and that's spelled x i a in the pinion system of Chinese romanization I explained that X sound in the last question and answer podcast in the old way Giles system it's written HS a it was the first of China's three dynasties of the Bronze Age the Shang and the Joe being the other two to round out this Trio in fact you can call the Sha period a Neolithic Dynasty this is the period oh say about 4 to 5,000 years ago when metal copper and bronze mostly starts to become prevalent in the great civilizations that were starting to form the Neolithic period or some refer to it as the new stone age started around 10,000 or 9,000 BC and then sort of Blends into the bronze and Iron Age which just sort of slowly Peters out this is the case with the SHA time period in China now the Joe Dynasty the third of these three dynasties was the only one that left any written records of their time period that means everything and everything we know about the xia and Shang dynasties comes from records written after the fact for this reason we refer to the Sha as a legendary Dynasty even if you go with the 2070 BC is the approximate start date that's almost 4,100 years ago this period to give you a time reference was was a good 500 years after the Great Pyramid was completed in 2560 BC the Old Kingdom in Egypt is ending about now in the Middle Kingdom Period is just starting so it's hard enough to get solid info from history from even 500 years ago so you can imagine what kind of data there is to accurately tell the story of the Sha Dynasty there's a lot of speculation and Analysis from some very smart historians archaeologists but the Sha doesn't have much if anything to show for itself that's why the Appalachian legendary will often precede the name of this dynasty the population of China back then was about 1 to two million people all living in various States or kingdoms led by whoever the local strongman or leader was they were constantly Waring with each other and there wasn't even a hint of any unified central government China still had a good two Millennia to go yet before the likes of Ching Sher Wang D molded all these Waring States and kingdoms into one Central Chinese State the Sha lasted approximately 439 years by most Reckoning and according to sumat Chen's great work the sh or records of the grand historian there were 17 Emperors from this dynasty suin once again as I mentioned in previous podcasts is called the Herodotus of China and he referred to the Sha as the first dynasty Suma begins his work with the San hang wui or three sovereigns and five Emperors a quick rundown on the sanang or the three sovereigns depending on which sacred text you're reading the three were fushi and his Queen newwa who gave mankind the idea of marriage music writing painting fishing with Nets how to domesticate animals and how the whole silkor worm thing worked fushi died and was followed by shanong the second of the three sovereigns shanong as his name suggests since the word N means Agriculture and a n mean is a farmer introduced agriculture to the people and gave the plow to mankind he also introduced markets and trade and is also credited with creating Chinese medicine that use natural plants and herbs the third some say was hangi the yellow Emperor but an equal number of texts also called the third Sovereign the three-eyed San he was the Prometheus of China as he gave fire to man and taught him how to use it hang D or the yellow Emperor as I just said is considered the first of the five legendary Emperors the descendants of the first three dynasties in Chinese history the Sha Shang and Cho all claimed lineage from the yellow Emperor he is the originator of Chinese culture the first son of Heaven inventor of garment making boats vehicles of Transport houses and palaces all Chinese according to the mythology would be considered descendants of the yellow emperor in quick succession you had the yellow Emperor followed by his grandson Jan Shu the emperor CP the emperor ya and last but not least Emperor schw our story as far as the Sha Dynasty is concerned begins with Emperor Yao now it was said that during the time of Yao and shun the Primitive patriarchal society started to develop into more of a monarchical style during the time of Yao the Yellow River was flooding like crazy and causing all kinds of Devastation as the legend goes ya sought help from the people to come up with some sort of way to control this River and all the flooding that was caused by it a man of reputation as a problem solver named good was chosen by Emperor Yao to take on this great task to control the flooding G tried all kinds of methods dams dikes and what have you after nine years of trying he failed now during this period when GW was trying to relieve the flooding Emperor ya handed power over to the last of the five Emperors shun and it was shun who seeing G's failure had him banished or executed for the crime of not pulling through on such an important Mission and so it fell upon G's son named U to finish the job that his father started it is written that you was born in suan in modern day Bean some of you may remember this town as round zero for the massive 2008 great sitron earthquake Yu left ban for Sunan known as one of the five sacred mountains of China Sunan was just south of the Yellow River right smack dab in between loang and jungo in Hunan Province Chinese kung fu enthusiasts might be interested to know that shaen Temple was also right close by Sunan now you was fully cognizant of what his father tried and failed to do and he was resolv to succeed as a way to sort of avenge his father's honor and so the legend of you the great begins with The Taming of the floods now Yu was a great great grandson of the yellow Emperor and a grandson of Jan Shu and he's a certified hero in Chinese folklore he was described as an active prompt capable and diligent man his virtues were prominent and his goodness made him beloved by the people and his word could be trusted you worked on this problem for 13 years the most famous story from this period concerned his selfless commitment to the task at hand During the period of 13 years he made it back to his hometown three times and on each of the three occasions did not even enter his home but instead kept walking right past it so selflessly devoted was you to solving the problem of the flooding first that he ignored his family in favor of completing his work you traveled the entirety of the realm at the time which was centered around present day shanii and shanii notice those last two provinces now here's a quick sidebar on Chinese language and this one always tripped me up you have two provinces in China right next door to each other they are both spelled s h NX I in the pinin system of romanization but one is pronounced shanii that first tone first tone and the other ones pronounce Shan Shi third tone Shan and then the same exact character character she that's a good example of how just a slight difference in tone changes everything well to make things easier the China government officially spells shanii as s h a NX I and Shi as s h nxi it's bad enough that they are homonyms but why did they have to be right next door to each other too even to this day sometimes I have to stop and think Shian Shian is there Shan or shanii anyway portions of these three provinces is the area where we're concerned with and it was through these three provinces that the Yellow River ran and still runs today as a matter of fact you made a unified plan to control the problem and use dredging and canals and levies as his method to relieve the flooding he had all these streams and ditches dredged and channeled the flood water ERS out to the Sea his method worked and great honors were heaped upon Him shun presented you with a dark Jade scepter and announced to everyone the achievement of you he then presented you to the heavens and proclaimed him his air then 17 years later shun died and Yu became the emperor his dynastic title was Lord of Shia and his family name was s Yu was given the appellation of the great t he's referred to you the great he became the first king of the Shia Dynasty now other than this legend of the floods and how you the great tamed them and became the emperor it is really thin GRL indeed about the rest of the Sha Dynasty in fact the matter of succession to Y the great is about all there is to the story and then for the next 14 Emperors there aren't even any wild Legends to talk about it's not until the last emperor of the Sha y that you get a little bit of meat in that thin grul as I said there are no written records or even hard evidence of the existence of the Sha Dynasty everything we know comes from either suin or from the bamboo annals of about 300 BC the way kings were chosen up until Us's time was through the process of meritorious succession whoever was the best man for the job got the job but it was with you that we get the first hereditary d Dynasty now you chose his own successor amongst his tribal Chiefs a man called gal but he didn't survive you the great and they had to think of a plan B now you came up with someone named B but once you died somewhere near shaing in Jang Province Yu's son named Chi was elected in B's place what happened to B no one knows I read accounts that he was killed by Chi so the leadership passes from father to Sun and here we have the first hereditary Dynasty so let's just fast forward 4 and 1/2 centuries to the 17th and last ruler of the Sha Dynasty Emperor Gia y the great and Emperor Gia are sort of like a pair of books one at the start and one at the finish of the Shia Dynasty one went down in history revered almost as a God and the other well he's remembered as an evil Tyrant who personified all the things that one nor Al attributes to a bad Emperor extravagant wasteful more concerned with carnal Pleasures than matters of State or the Weare of the people you know stuff like that every civilization from every corner of the world is littered with these kinds of characters sumach Chen alleges that the shungu the people who we discussed in the Ching sharang podcast could be traced to Emperor G's son the shungu were a thorn in the side of the Han Chinese throughout history or at least till the time of the tong Dynasty there's an old Legend regarding Emperor Gia that every Source I read mentioned he was infatuated with his evil concubine named mhi he humored her ridiculous request one day to have a lake constructed and filled to the brim with wine instead of water enough for 3,000 soldiers to jump in and to drink it dry the legend has it that they all drowned and that the sheer outrageousness of this request made for a great Legend and whether or not it happened who knows but they definitely pinned it Ania and it was something he had associated with his name that showed what kind of a ruler he was there were all kinds of natural disasters and astronomical anomalies during the time of Gia that were mentioned in the ancient writings stuff like this is usually associated with a ruler who loses the Mandate of Heaven There was a virtuous man who was part of 's Court named Yin Yi who came from the state of Shang he tried to advise Gia to cool it and be more of a man of the people but Emperor J would have nothing of this well this y Yin uh he ended up throwing his lot in with King Tong of the Shang State the Shang State went from being one of the many states subservient to the Shia but ended up defeating Gia in battle and forced him to flee to nancha in present day an where the last emperor of the Sha Dynasty died in 1675 BC once King Tong saw that the Sha was in Decline he initiated a number of wars that ultimately led to the demise of not only the wicked Emperor Gia but his dynasty as well it was 1675 BC when the Shia ended and the Shang began like I said at the beginning the dates aren't agreed upon some say 1675 BC the Sha ended and others say 1600 BC and it's the sh Dynasty that we'll look at in the next podcast there is only two words that come to mind when I think of the Shang and that's Oracle bones the Shang people didn't leave any written records that survived to modern times so all we have is whatever archaeologists have been able to dig up so we'll cover what a lot of people call the first real dynasty of China and trust me when I say there isn't much to hang on to and it's only slightly less legendary than the Sha I hope you'll tune in when I air that one so for now this is loo Montgomery once again wishing everyone a fond farewell from blissville Claremont California 91711 the one the only keep those questions topics suggestions and comments coming
