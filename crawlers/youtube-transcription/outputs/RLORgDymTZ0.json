"long long ago in a land known as Suma an ancient civilization emerged it was one of the earliest in the world blooming in the southern region of Mesopotamia which is today's Southeastern Iraq this civilization made its mark from the mid4 Millenium BCE until Babylonia rise in the late 3D Millennium bcee these people known as the Sumerians are important because they were among the first to fully embody what we call a civilization they had organized cities sophisticated art trade writing and Monumental architecture including those famous cigarettes or temples notably the Sumerians accredited with inventing writing and the legal systems that were essential to maintaining order in their city states these legal codes set penalties for specific wrongdoings reflecting a crucial understanding that a society couldn't function without shared values and respect for life and property the Sumerian contributions to human history reached far and wide they helped people realize their shared connection to the same world mainly through their focus on trade and commerce Samaria wasn't just a society it was a cultural and social milestone in the development of our species you might wonder why we call them Sumerians when they referred to themselves differently the Sumerians called themselves the blackheaded people and their land land of civilized Lords the acadians who came later are the ones who gave them the name Sumerians it's still still a mystery why the acadians used this term for the people of southern Mesopotamia but here's the interesting part other ancient cultures had their own versions of this name in the Bible you can find Shina the Egyptians had sngr and the Hittites used sanar a all of which could be Western variants of Suma the Sumerians weren't Outsiders or Invaders they were native to this land the archaeological records show continuous cultural development from the early ubod period it's a bit like seeing a family tree where there are no missing branches this region was known for its dry climate today it receives less than 5 in of rainfor the year so the Sumerians faced a significant challenge how to manage the Tigris and Euphrates rivers to ensure a yearr round water supply for farming and daily life they used a range of technical terms for canals dikes and reservoirs in their language emphasizing their expertise in managing water the Sumerian language was the key to understanding this Society they were skilled farmers who migrated from the north where they had mastered the art of irrigation agriculture their Journey South was driven by the need to find fertile land made so by the silk deposits from the Tigris and Euphrates as you might guess controlling water was a big deal in this arid region and the samans knew it they established Temple centered social structures that mobilized labor and technology for water management this was essential for their survival and prosperity in a challenging environment in essence the Sumerians were the original masters of irrigation and they transformed the southern Mesopotamian flood plane into a thriving civilization they left an indelible mark on human history and set the stage for the many civilizations that would follow let's begins with the ubod period at this time something remarkable was happening in Suma a unique style of fine painted Pottery began to appear spreading across Mesopotamia and the pers Gulf as this was happening the ancient city of eridu was slowly being overshadowed by the neighboring city of uro now things got really interesting when we moved from the ubod period to the urk period which roughly spans from 4,500 to 3100 BCE during this time trade was thriving people were transporting goods along the canals and rivers of southern Mesopotamia and this allowed large Temple centered cities to flourish these cities were becoming organized hubs employing specialized workers to keep things running smoothly but there was a catch the Sumerians in order to expand needed more labor and so they started using slaves captured from the Hill Country the evidence for this includes actual artifacts and texts from that time the impact of Sumerian civilization was incredible their culture and economy influenced neighboring regions from the tourist mountains in Turkey to the Mediterranean Sea in the west and even as far east as Central Iran however their power wasn't Limitless as their cities spread the idea of maintaining colonies far away through military force was challenging the uro period eventually came to a close it coincided with a dry period known as the prior oscillation which lasted from around 3,200 to 2900 BCE this marked the end of a much wetter and warmer climate period known as the hollene climatic Optimum which occurred thousands of years ago by the time our historical record opens the Sumerians appear to be primarily located in southern Mesopotamia legendary figures like en mker and Gilgamesh are associated with the transfer of culture from eridu to urak fast forward to the early dynastic period This is where we find the earliest records of Sumerian rulers some names on the early King list might be more Legend than fact but eventually we can match those names to real people through archaeological evidence atana the 13th King of the the first dynasty of Kish is one such example Lugal z c the priest king of Amar was another influential figure he overthrew the leash Dynasty took urak as his capital and created an Empire extending from the Persian Gulf to the Mediterranean the lagash dynasty was a period of monumental monuments and early Empire Building enum of leash is well known for annexing much of Suma his power reached from the city states of Kish and urak to ER and Lassa as we we move further through time we enter the Acadian Dynasty the Semitic Acadian language started appearing in names around 2800 BCE sagon the great a mighty ruler held power from 2350 to 2330 BCE however even during his Reign many administrative tablets were still written in Sumerian this is because Sumerian remained the language of the scribes Acadian Sumerian and their speakers coexisted for a long time from 2,800 to 1800 BCE they shared the Mesopotamian landscape but eventually Sumerian ceased to be spoken marking the end of an era the land of Suma with its clay tablets and Monumental Empires paved the way for the rise of many civilizations it was a place where history was etched into the very soil a story waiting to be discovered in the dust of time in the aftermath of the Acadian Empires fall at the hands of the kins a native Sumerian guda of leash emerged guda championed artistic growth and continued the tradition of Saron Kings claims to Divinity as Suma saw the light at the end of a dark period this Renaissance brought hope the third Dynasty ER led by ER namamu and sheli sha during what we now call the Sumerian Renaissance their power reached far extending into northern Mesopotamia yet change was a foot the region was gradually becoming more Semitic with waves of Maru or amorites pouring in these newcomers would later establish the Babylonian Empire Still sumarian remained a sacred language akin to how Latin was used in medieval Europe as long as kuna form script endured ecologically su's Bountiful land was under threat due to Rising salinity irrigation essential for agriculture brought its own challenges evaporation Left Behind dissolved sorts making it harder to sustain farming by 2000 BCE a depopulation crisis hit southern Mesopotamia leading to the downfall of Sumerian culture soon a new chapter unfolded elamite Invaders sacked ER and Suma came under Amorite rule marking the middle Bronze Age The Independent Amorite States summarized as the dynasty of isin held sway until the rise of Babylonia under hamurabi in approximately 1730 BCE this period was also characterized by a sign significant shift in population from Southern Iraq to the north due to increasing soil salinity soil salinity had been a persistent issue leading to a decline in the population the balance of power shifted with a Cadian becoming the dominant language and Sumerian persisted mainly as a sacred learned language now let's Venture into the vibrant world of Sumerian agriculture the Sumerians embraced an agricultural lifestyle much like that of ancient Egypt they grew barley wheat dates and a variety of vegetables their livestock included cattle sheep goats and pigs oxen toiled in the fields and donkeys served as transport irrigation was the lifeblood of Sumerian farming employing techniques like shads canals dkes and reservoirs however the Tigris and Euphrates rivers frequent violent floods required constant maintenance After the flood season Farmers flooded and then drained their fields ox would trample the soil and kill weeds followed by plowing harrowing and planting over time barley replaced wheat as the primary crop due to its salt tolerance harvest season was a community Affair three person teams consisting of Reapers binders and shifa Rangers worked together threshing wagons and sleds separated grain from stalks followed by winnowing to separate grain from chaff let's turn our gaze to architecture Sumerian structures primarily consisted of mud brick made without mortar or cement these structures were frequently rebuilt gradually elevating the cities on Mounds known as TS among their architectural Marvels zigurat stood out these towering structures supported Grand temples some Scholars even theorize that these zigurat Inspire the tale of the Tower of Babel from The Book of Genesis Sumerians also built houses from Reeds and employed arches creating a strong roof type called a dome the the realm of Suma was rich in culture and Innovation Sumerian culture was influenced by two main centers eridu and nepur eridu was associated with enki the god of wisdom while nepur worshiped enlil the lord of the Ghost Land these Gods reflected the unique aspects of these cities and over time their cultures Blended in the realm of Law and governance Sumerians developed a legal code perhaps most famously represented by the code of hamurabi the Sumerians deferred diplomacy over conflict and treaties from this era reflect their inclination for peaceful resolutions while late Sumerian law protected women and granted them a higher status than in some contemporary societies the culture was predominantly male-dominated music played an essential role in Sumerian life the people had a deep love for music and it was an integral part of their religious and Civic ceremonies Liars were particularly popular now let's delve into the world of trade and econ the Sumerians engaged in a vast network of trade connected to distant lands they imported obsidian from Anatolia lapis lazuli from Northeastern Afghanistan and Beads from dilman Modern Bahrain the Epic of Gilgamesh even references trade with far-off regions to acquire precious resources Ceda from Lebanon was especially prized the Sumerians like many ancient civilizations used slaves for various tasks although they weren't the Cornerstone of the economy in their craftsmanship Sumerian Potters painted their pots with cedar oil mud brick houses were periodically reconstructed due to wear and tear in their more advanced structures they used techniques like buttresses recesses half columns and Clay Nails the story of Suma is one of grand ziggurats mountainful fields and diplomatic wisdom it was a civilization that embraced change faced ecological challenges and left behind a rich Legacy the suir an were no strangers to Conflict for their city states battled almost ceaselessly for two Millennia these struggles were a crucible for military prowess the first recorded conflict occurred in 2525 bcee between leash and Amar a battle preserved in the steel of vultures the steel depicts the leash King leading a Sumerian Army mainly composed of foot soldiers these infantrymen wielded Spears donning copper helmets and leather shields they stood United in a fanks formation hinting at their professionalism and discipline in their military Endeavors the Sumerians employed chariots harness to hes though these early designs were less effective in combat and perhaps served more as transports yet the crew carried battle axes and lances the Sumerian Chariot was a four or two wheeled cart drawn by a pair of onagers comprising a woven basket and solid three-piece Wheels Sumerian cities stood encircled by defensive walls these walls made of mud brick weren't always impervious to their adversaries revealing the complex nature of Siege Warfare in this ancient land in matters of Faith Suma was a polytheistic Society much like other cities in its vicinity however the Sumerians were one of the first to put their beliefs into writing each city state had its own Patron deities temples and priest Kings with no centralized Pantheon their Chief God was Anu symbolizing Heaven while key represented the Earth the Divine group The anunaki included deities like eni in the south at aru enlil in the north at nepur and Anon the goddess of Venus at uruk's Ana Temple Sun the ever shining U was revered in sippa and the moon Nana H namu one of the names of the mother goddess was considered the original Matrix countless minor deities played diverse roles the political fortunes of cities often correlated with the religious importance of their Patron God according to Sumerian belief the gods created humans from clay to serve them yet these deities weren't always benevolent they could express their displeasure through earthquakes and storms in the Sumerian Cosmos the universe was a flat disc enclosed by a tin Dome the afterlife was a dismal descent into the Netherworld where one's eternity was marked by a wretched existence as a jym a ghost Sumerian temples were a focal point of their culture these temples featured a for court with a central Pond for purification known as the absu inside the temple included a central Nave with aisles on either side alongside rooms for priests the end of the temple housed a Podium and a mud brick table for offering sacrifices granaries and storehouses often stood nearby over time Sumerians began to build their temples at top multi-tiered square structures known as zigurat rising as a series of terraces the Sumerian tale unfold s with the Clashing of armies the enigmatic ways of gods and the Magnificent Ascent to the heavens through their temples "
