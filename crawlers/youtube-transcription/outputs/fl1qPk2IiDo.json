"They would actually drink until they were\u00a0\nso drunk, that they would fall in and drown Hey guys, welcome to Learn Chinese Now, I'm your\u00a0\nhost Jared Madsen and today we will be talking\u00a0\u00a0 about China's very first dynasty the Xia Dynasty apparently happened somewhere around 2000 BC What the stories tell us is that the dynasty began with\u00a0\nthis massive flood. Now this flood just took over all of China. There was a guy his name was Gun and he was dedicated to fixing the flood and he worked for years and years, but he couldn't figure it out. But his son, who was his apprentice, had all these really good ideas. His son's name was Yu and so\u00a0\nYu worked for 13 years straight. The story goes that he never actually even returned home. He was\u00a0just dedicated to working and fixing the flood. His way of fixing the flood actually gave birth to\u00a0\nagriculture in China, because now they knew how to control water. He was really considered to be the\u00a0beginning of the dynasty, even though technically technically there was another guy in charge. That\u00a0guy was Shun. Now so of course after the flooding had been fixed - Yu throughout the land - everybody\u00a0was like this guy is great this guy's awesome and in the traditions of ancient ancient China, the\u00a0role of leader would be passed on to the most capable person. So naturally Shun asked Yu to\u00a0\nbe the the \"emperor\" to be the ruler. So then Yu became the ruler, then he started to get old and\u00a0he needed to pass on his throne to someone else. And he decided to pass it on to Qi his son. So\u00a0this is the first time that a ruler had passed on their position to not the most capable person, but\u00a0their son. That was the beginning of the hereditary rule of China's dynastic history. Some may even say\u00a0that's where nepotism began. I don't know, we don't know, we don't know. Qi was a very good ruler\u00a0but Tai Kang (Qi's son) was not a very good ruler, he was kind of lazy and corrupt, as apparently, I don't\u00a0\nknow, maybe that happens on the third generation. Who knows, anyway there was a lot of internal\u00a0\nstruggle and external struggle, but finally they kind of got it back together and the family\u00a0maintained power. Now we fast forward... So the Xia dynasty's final ruler was Jie who was not only a tyrant he was also a raging\u00a0alcoholic and he had a concubine they had this one thing that they would do they thought it\u00a0would be really funny to kind of dig this big pit and dump a bunch of alcohol in it and make\u00a0this kind of alcohol lake. And then they would get soldiers, they would actually drink until they\u00a0were so drunk that they would fall in and drown and apparently the ruler of the Xia Dynasty\u00a0and his concubine thought that was just hysterical. So as you can tell that dynasty\u00a0was getting pretty bad at the time, got weak and then was attacked by this band called\u00a0the Shang, and so they came in, they took over and then they declared the next dynasty,\u00a0which is the Shang Dynasty. So unfortunately we don't have a lot more information about\u00a0the Xia Dynasty, even though it lasted for something like 400 years.
