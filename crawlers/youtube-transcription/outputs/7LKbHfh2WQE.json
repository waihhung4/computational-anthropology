"[Music] ladies and gentlemen welcome back i know what you're thinking abernic didn't you say that the last video was going to be the last of this series that clearly died in popularity and no one watches anymore yeah that's true that's what i said yet i realized that i had forgotten to talk about terrace which was definitely not intentional so a lot of people have been asking me why i was so harsh on terrace and what did it do to deserve my neglect well back when i made the syracuse video i quickly went through the histories of the the four civilizations i proposed in the poll and terrorist was the least interesting for me as it really reminded me of syracuse and i did not want to give greeks a second episode in a serie which didn't really wasn't wasn't really about them however after i had my second look i realized that terrace's impact was very substantial arguably to the same amounts as syracuse so let's put the bad thoughts aside and let's get right into the good history so the city of terrace was founded in the later 700s bc and it sits right here south of apulia what seems to be the first thing you see is the weird shape and how effective it can be in terms of defense right in between the sea and the lagoon plays the acropolis of the city with all the government buildings in religious structures as well as where the military is stationed on the left it's where most people lived uh and the necropolis the place where the dead were buried usually necropolises are like amusement parks of or archaeologists in fact there are several sit stations where the digging is done now that we more or less know how ancient terrace was organized let's talk about its inhabitants the greeks who founded terrace were related to the ones from sparta and as we will later see they kept their bonds with spartan culture to a substantial extent the tarasians loved posadan or neptune if you are a rome fanboy their biggest temple was dedicated to the god of the sea himself taras also had a giant statue of zias which was very big yet no one talks about it because it was beaten by the colossus of rhodes in terms of height another great structure was the amphitheater that faced the ocean but that last part is important you will find out later why their most important celebration was the early festival diagnosis the god of wine and parties i don't think i need to explain what the celebration was about taras was not that big of a threat for the first 200 years of its history they were in fact constantly under the threat of native papules such as the poechetsi and the missapiens check out the misappians video for more about them the reason why they were so weak was because they didn't have a democracy and usually wouldn't be that much of a problem under the fact that their monarchy was extremely messy and had a hard time to stay in power eventually after losing against a native between 500 bc circa the mark was dethroned and the democracy was established during this time the spartan ways of tyrants started to float back up as their passive foreign policy was completely renewed in favor of a more expansionistic one at the expense of the poetry and the miss sapiens initially they were the only ones getting wrecked until 444 bc when a dispute came up with another greek colony in calabria called turi the dispute was a territorial one over the control of the area of era clia which would be today's basilicata for 144 bc the two fought without reaching a proper agreement and 11 years later they fold again with another statement stalemate but this time decided to share the region terrorist was not done though during the peloponnesian war they sided with sparta and sent supplies the spartans paid off paid back the favor in 343 bc when he went at war with with the miss sappings together with with taras which they lost 5 years later and the spartan king was killed don't be alarmed though taras was still pretty powerful so powerful that rome got involved in 303 bc when the lucanians a tribe in calabria asked them to intervene in the conflict in between them because they were losing pretty badly roman rebel didn't feel very confident about this so he accepted the alliance but only to negotiate peace with terrorists one of the conditions was from terrace was that rome was not allowed to enter their sea territory which meant they could not cross this spot with their ships this wimpy attitude from rome wouldn't last long as in 282 bc the city of turi asked rome for assistance for a siege by the lucani bud surrendered their capital rome sent 10 ships to help however they had to go into terrace's territory in order to reach the city and so they did after successfully taking down the leukemians the ten ships went to terrace while you ask i could not phone find out why but i guess it was to resupply or something you already know one of the reasons why it was a bad idea but here's the second reason the day the roman ships arrived in toronto i mean terrace was doing the festival of diagnosis and all the people were at the amphitheater having a good time and since they faced the sea they could clearly see the roman ships are approaching the romans were not very liked by terrorists so the moon was quickly ruined and terrorists sent their own fleet to deal with the romans the romans lost of course and while in any other context the romans would have would have declared war after such an insult the romans decided to send an ambassador to deal with the issue the man chose to negotiate the lives of the prisoners captured and the ships taken was lucius posthumous magellas unfortunately it was not greeted respectfully he was made fun of for his clothes and his funny greek the last straw was reached when a politician sped on him postomius lost it and went back to rome then the war between the two powers in italy began in 281 bc as you can imagine rome won this war in 272 even though taras initially had the upper hand due to his ally king of empires appears the first it lost anyway and all of the treasures and great minds of taras were taken and moved to rome instead since then terrace hasn't been the same during the second punic war it had a minor role when the city now under roman control opened its gates to anibal though it was punished three years after the conflict by having their people massacred from then on no more insurrections came to be and the people who were left eventually got absorbed into roman society so guys we did it we finally finished the series i'm already thinking what to do next but i was considering to talk about more about history of course but you know extend myself into other periods of time and not only to you know just concentrate and focus on ancient history and perhaps also go back to anthropology perhaps i will try have even less of a schedule so that every time there is a new video it's always a surprise however um i will still keep um some sort of continuity um or maybe why don't you give me some suggestions i would really appreciate it actually anyway that's all i have i'll see you next time and let me know what you like you "
