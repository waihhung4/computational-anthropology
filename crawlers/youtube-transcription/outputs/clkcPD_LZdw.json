"[music playing] NARRATOR: As far as\nancient astronaut theorists are concerned, evidence that\nthere is other intelligent life in the universe has\nalready been found on every corner of the globe. They believe Earth has been\nvisited by intelligent beings for thousands of\nyears, and that it most likely began\nduring the time of the ancient Sumerian kings. Khorsabad, Iraq, March 23, 1843. While excavating for\narcheological treasures, a group of men, led by French\nscientist Paul- mile Botta, came upon the remains of\na huge Assyrian palace, and within it, an\nabundance of Sumerian cuneiform inscriptions. When translated,\nthe inscriptions told of what archaeologists\nbelieved to be the world's oldest civilization and a\ngroup of powerful beings called the Anunnaki. ANDREW COLLINS: The Anunnaki\nwas a term of the gods used by the ancient Sumerians,\nbut the original form of it, it simply meant\n\"the sky people.\" It meant those that were\nconnected with the stars. The Anunnaki were seen to be\nthe givers of civilization to mortalkind. And they are described as\nhaving the shining eyes, and having a radiance, and\nan otherworldly feeling about them. NARRATOR: Based on 30 years of\nstudying the Sumerian cuneiform tablets, in 1976, author and\nresearcher Zecharia Sitchin published a book called \"The\n12th Planet,\" in which he proposed that the Sumerian\ngods were, in fact, refugees from another world. According to Sitchin's\ninterpretation of the tablets, these alien visitors, the\nAnunnaki, created humankind. JASON MARTELL: It\nappears to be that gods came down and literally started\na colonization project here on Earth, creating us in their\nimage and after their likeness. It also might stand to reason,\nthen, that they've infused us with the desire to\nspread this colonization project beyond Earth. GEORGE NOORY: I think if you\nlook at what we've been doing in our space program,\nit's a blueprint for what may have\nhappened here a long time ago with extraterrestrials. But I think we're\non the same path. We're beginning to understand\nthat the Anunnaki gods, that were actually ETs,\ncould be still out throughout the universe,\nthat we could now, as we are starting to head out into\nspace, be encountering the prime intelligence\nthat originally had civilizations on\nEarth and were working throughout this solar system.
