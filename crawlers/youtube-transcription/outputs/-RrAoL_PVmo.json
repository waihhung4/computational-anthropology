"[Music] this is the Bronze Age an eleven part collaboration be sure to follow up with videos from vc3 and overly sarcastic productions more info on that at the end of the video [Music] the geographical region that became China has clear territorial boundaries the Gobi Desert in the north dense jungle in the South while the East and West are bounded by formidable mountains and the sea nearly all of the land fit for agriculture in this region is centered around the floodplains surrounding the Yellow River Valley in the north and the yangzi river in the south the major early prehistoric cultures of China were centered around the middle and lower Yellow River Valley these early people were the first to control the unpredictable and dangerous floods of the River Valley through sophisticated irrigation techniques drastically increasing crop yields and population of the region and are likely the basis for the semi-mythical xia dynasty not long after the first bronze objects were cast in the area of the Yellow River the Shang rose to power they built the oldest nation-state in Asia that we have significant undisputable historical proof for as they left behind a fully formed writing system a precursor to modern Chinese with over 3000 characters many still in use today the Shang were led by an all-powerful priest king who ruled over a rapidly increasing population which expanded in every direction colonizing and building large walled cities throughout the kingdom the greatest of which was an yang capital city of 12 Kings and eight generations of Shang much of this growth was fueled by bronze sharpen hardy bronze agricultural tools increased farming productivity armies armed with bronze weapons and armor could conquer and control more territory and large bronze bells and ritual items demonstrated the wealth and power of the state and the king between 1300 and 1200 BC the domesticated horse and spokes wheeled chariot changed the face of warfare and societal structure within Shang China now beneath the king was a powerful military nobility who controlled vast sprawling estates centered around the production and maintenance of chariots and the breeding of horses over time the Shang gained a reputation for cruelty and oppression evidenced by the hundreds of commoners believed to have been buried alive they have been found in the graves of Shang nobility along the banks of the way River to the west of the Shang the state of Jo steadily grew in power as a nominal vassal state of the Shang around the Year 1050 BC - Jo cross the Yellow River with the army of fifty thousand men initially greatly outnumbered their fortunes drastically improved when a hundred and seventy thousand slaves that have been armed to protect the capital city defected and joined the Jo the king of Shang sent his own palace on fire dying within they were able to defeat the Shang establishing the Jo dynasty unlike the king of Shang who ruled a very centralized state the Jo implemented a system based around semi independent feudal states governed by the Kings sixteen brothers other family members and in-laws Jo's first King Wu would only rule for three years when his son succeeded him to the throne a massive rebellion erupted Shang loyalists joined together with discontented Nobles including three of the young kings uncles however another Uncle Dan the duke of jo the deceased king's older brother stayed loyal to the young king as regent he defeated the rebellion and his younger brothers in a three-year war and then consolidated and expanded the kingdom and developed the Mandate of Heaven doctrine to justify the divine right to rule of the Jo because the Shang had become corrupt and decadent the duke of jo o Sole established a new eastern capital city at low yang to administer the eastern portion of the kingdom once the young King came of age he gave up power stepping down his Regent without any trouble or conflict the Duke of jo is still revered today in China as an example of loyalty the Jo dynasty is divided into two periods the Western Jo and the eastern Jo during the Western Jo the kingdom was ruled from the twin capital cities of Fung how the Western Jo period ended when the King was killed and the capital city was destroyed by an alliance of Western nomads and the family of one of the Kings disgruntled wives again the Mandate of Heaven doctrine was used to legitimize a violent change in government which would become a reoccurring theme in much of Chinese history the capital was moved east to low yang beginning to Eastern Jo dynasty which is split into the spring and autumn and warring States Period the spring and autumn period saw a continual decline in the Kings power to the point where he only had a ceremonial rule while the Marquis and Dukes of joke and greater autonomy gathering large private armies and becoming fully independent states over time during the spring and autumn period an endless cavalcade of increasingly large-scale wars between hundreds of tiny states gradually coalesced into a little over a dozen warring States despite the violence and chaos of this age it was also an age a profound philosophical thought with the philosopher lao-tzu emphasized living in harmony with the natural world Confucius the founder of Confucianism believed justice peace and properly acting out one's role in life where the greatest aims for a person and a society han fei's doctrines of legalism taught that people were selfish and needed strict restrictions placed upon them in order for society to function properly these ideas heavily influenced Chinese bureaucratic administration for millennia to come son Zhu a military advisor and General for the state of Wu wrote down a military treatise the art of war the strategies in this book have been employed in Asian warfare ever since they were written down and later have been heavily used in the West and even the business world and remains a best-seller even to this day the constant warfare of this period necessitated military innovation the world's first ever trigger operated firearm the crossbow was invented around 650 BC and soon after it was being mass-produced in all of the Chinese states around 600 BC iron smelting technology was either independently invented or introduced into China eventually all of these warring States were unified by China's first emperor ginger Huang in 221 BC who had conquered the jo thirty-five years before beginning China's imperial Age Bronze Age China saw the oldest continuous civilization that still exists today with its contemporary Bronze Age Egyptian Mesopotamian and Near Eastern civilizations fading away China's geographical isolation and distinct natural borders fostered a unique culture which during the Bronze Age looked at itself as not the civilization but the only civilization beginning in the Jo dynasty and perhaps before that began referring to their own country as the Middle Kingdom China being the modern name they viewed the fringe states that surrounded their territory as barbarians who made pale imitations of their own culture the most impressive of these was the state of shoe which created some of the most impressive bronze work ever created interestingly China's population greatly increased during the spring and autumn and warring States period with these states making up over a quarter of the world's population of the time this was largely due to advances in irrigation and farming technology the wide implementation of coinage throughout the eastern zone period facilitated a robust economy that seemed to thrive in whatever states were not being currently ravaged by the wars of war and saw the emergence for the first time of a large middle class in Asia where those who were not hereditary landowners could purchase land with money they had accumulated this has been Epimetheus and this is one of my favorite areas in history as it is so unique if you would like to learn more about the Bronze Age right now look in the description of this video and there will be a link to a playlist or 11 other channels have made videos about the Bronze Age right before me in the playlist is overly sarcastic productions where blue made a fantastic video about the Mesopotamian Bronze Age and next up right after me is vc3 productions which made a video about the Indus Valley Civilisation one of the most mysterious and interesting places in time "
