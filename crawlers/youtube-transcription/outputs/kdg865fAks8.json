"people in Egypt they believed in what's called Kemet the people that existed before the Egyptians when we'd hear these stories about the Great Pyramid being a tomb for the Pharaoh it's worth mentioning that even the locals didn't believe that the saying that the pyramids were built to be tombs for the Pharaohs wasn't even developed until 150 years ago that's it they were taught Kemet and it's worth mentioning that when you go through inside these Pyramids of Giza there's not one single glyph in any of them whatsoever there was never a mummy found in any Egyptian pyramid ever quite literally the only reason why we are told this stuff is because that was the theory developed by these men that went in there and said I believe these must have been for the Pharaohs that makes sense so it's all just one group of people had one Theory and that theory just stuck around 100 percent [Music] "
