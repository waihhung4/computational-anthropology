"this is the Matrix of creation literally encoded in this king's list one of the most famous pieces of ununiform on our planet that we have ever decoded and the first three kings the Holy Trinity is it's like they were cheat codes provided to you in advance to escape what we're going to address today is the Matrix of all creation that phys is talk about is there a matrix running behind everything that we would call reality in Judaism we see the 72 names of God in ancient Egyptian Osiris was dismembered into 72 Pieces by God's Lords of the Underworld until he was reassembled in Hinduism there's a famous battle between 72 jins in the Quran there's 72 mentioned all the time most famously that I had ever heard was there's 72 virgins waiting for Martyrs who died for the cause in Buddhism the biggest largest Buddhist temple in the world has 72 of these bell-like structures outside of it called stupas we're following a breadcrumb path of coincidence and what could these coincidences be guiding us to why are there three 360\u00b0 in a circle somebody had to have picked that at some point in our history and I have hosted out at the Integratron these talks and lectures and I've had mathematicians and Architects and people that use geometry in their algorithms and their research all the time and of course everyone is familiar with a circle having 360 degrees but to date no one has known why there's 360 Degrees a circle is 360 degrees because of a math system called sex aible math we are more comfortable with the idea of deciel math because that's base 10 math most of the world is now following base 10 math on the metric system base 10 math makes sense to us because we have 10 fingers and 10 toes and it's very easy to do math we're thinking in terms of sixes or 60s it doesn't seem so organic to us but hopefully I'm going to show you that it actually is but that's why a circle has 360\u00b0 is it is a function of six triangles with a 360\u00b0 laid over it and each one of those triangles at its core touching the middle is 60 degrees so 60 becomes and that's what sex adustable means is base 60 math why do we measure Time by 60 so even though we have to go back in time to find out where a 360\u00b0 Circle came from we are using a lot of sexable math today in our everyday lives so we measure Time by 60 60 seconds to a minute 60 minutes to an hour if you go around the world and travel you're very likely to find different measuring systems meters and miles and kilometers but if you're a boat captain or a plane pilot the world is divided into nautical miles and one degree nautical mile is 60th one degree of latitude equals 60 nautical miles or break it down into six nautical mile in increments so our whole planet we're measuring time and we're measuring our planet officially by functions of 60 sacred geometry is described as a function of circles but if you really look at it in these little flower petals look at just pick one of these flower petals for yourself and you will see well you won't know this but that Arc that makes that flower petal is exactly 60\u00b0 that's really important to sacred geometry is that you get that correct of 60\u00b0 of Arc Buckminster Fuller is called one of the greatest researchers and minds of the 20th century and he said 60 degree math and he even coined his own term he called synergetics reveals Nature's behaviors both physically and metaphysically and he went on to say because Society does not understand the significance of 60 degree geometry we may conclude that Society does not understand nature I hope to guide you down a path where you are going to understand and recognize how significant 60\u00b0 is and so much of your life and your surroundings and the nature around you is based on 60\u00b0 math this is a a form that Buckminster Fuller did not discover but he did name the vector equilibrium and he wrote two huge books about this shape alone uh called synergetics one and two and if you see that white center it has 12 vectors radi out of it they're all exactly the same length and they're all offset exactly the same from each other of 60\u00b0 Buckminster Fuller came to believe that this is the Matrix of creation that this is the geometry if physicist are right in telling us that our universe is geometric in nature somehow Buckminster Fuller argued that this is that geometry the vector equilibrium so how did we get to the 60 how did Humanity arrive at the 60 well that became a function of 12 if you take 12 and multiply it five times is how you get 60 and this is a counting system that's still taught in India in other parts of the world to school children but rather counting just each individual finger you use one hand and your thumb becomes a pointer and you have the pads or the knuckles of your four long finger so you have on the left one two 3 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 you have 12 space holders on your long fingers of one hand once you reach that 12 you use your other hand your right hand to hold that position five times so 12 * 1 is 12 and then when you get to 12 again on your left hand you hold up your second finger 12 + 12 is 24 24 + 12 is 36 36 + 12 is 48 and 48 + 12 is 60 every 12 that you know of in your life a dozen eggs dozen donuts 12 hours in a day 12 Saints 12 disciples 12 inches to a foot came from this counting system and all the 60s that we deal with on our daily basis geometry of 360 degree circle measuring time around us globally measuring our planet the way scientists and boat captains and airplane p let's measure it that 60 is all based on this counting system so this becomes a major clue in our path of Discovery how did where did this counting system come from but we know we know exactly where it came from and when for most of the human story life pre00 6,000 years ago looked something like this a hunter gatherer existence people were not farming they were just going where there was food to eat they had to go where there was fresh water to drink they wore animal skins they had very crude tools their shelter was very temporary and something they could transport this is most life on the planet pre 6,000 years ago but in one place in one time on our planet this showed up a modern city this is in Mesopotamia in Samaria and you're looking at multistory buildings you're looking at the world's first pyramidal structure called the zigurat the world's first sailboat the world's first written language the world's first wheeled and axled vehicle Loom to we fabric pottery wheel Plow Art things we use today and this is we're not talking about tweaking of Technology we're talking about the invention of Technology including the 1260 math system that we use today many books have been written WR about this moment in time in ancient Samaria saying civilization begins here the modern human experience with written language algebra calculus physics begins right here in this moment and we can read their language it's called uniform there are libraries now that have uniform tablets UCLA has roughly the of 12,000 of these small like iPad tablets with this language that we broke the code of and can read and we're and we can read what they had to say where did you come up with all of this technology language and the math they said we did not we were gifted this information by tall beings who came from the sky archaeologists want us to believe that these are just forers celebrating the birth of Agriculture and they're carrying these little handbags if you look at the far right guy or the far left guy they're carrying these little pouches and we have seen these Tall Bearded beings holding these pouches at all these crazy sites around the world that confound us as how they were built and yet we see these types of beings with these little bags and our planet does some very specific things that would be observable from a distance it has a spin rate it's very specific it has an orbit rate 365 days a year a day is one spin 365 of those spins creates an orbit but our planet does one other thing it wobbles these are non-arbitrary things these are mechanical things that our planet does spins at a certain rate orbits at a certain rate and Wobbles at a certain rate well that wobble is the biggest gear imagine all those things is Gears our spin rate of a day is very small gear our orbit circling around the Sun is a larger gear but the largest gear on our planet that it does is this wobble it takes 25,000 920 years to complete one full wobble and imagine like a top that is beginning to slow down and instead of being perfectly straight up and down it starts to wobble a bit now this wobble is what created a thing called the procession of the equinox and it's how we get our astrological ages but that 25920 becomes a very significant number so let's take that number 25920 that is a real non-arbitrary number but now let's start using the sky visitor Sumerian math that was taught to us to count on our fingers 25920 divided by surian math incredibly equals Sumerian geometry if the circle is 360 degrees this slide right here is the one that has physicists and mathematicians and professors totally scratching their head because now you're talking about something that while you might still want to argue it as arbitrary it starts leaning into nonarbitrary because of how well it cross checks itself so the non-arbitrary wobble divided by surian math equals surian geometry the first one 2160 that's the sum total of a cube 25920 divided by the second placeholder in your finger is 1080 an octagon 25920 divided 36 is 720 that's the sum total of a hexagon 25920 divided 48 is 540 the sum total of a pentagon and then 25920 divided by 60 is 432 the mysterious number that Joseph Campbell found all over the world in these mythologies and temples and religious teachings there's other crazy things here where did the second come from how did we get the formula for a second well we take 12 hours of day time 60 seconds time 60 minutes look at the number that it produces 432 with two zeros behind it 12 hours of night and time 60 seconds time 60 minutes again 43,200 Seconds Of Night total seconds in a day that was gifted to us that formula by these samarians 86,400 well if we use Samaran miles remember not metrics but miles Royal units our Sun's diameter in miles is a function of 864 with a bunch of Z behind it 864,000 mil across incredibly our moon is exactly half of 432 216 with one zero behind it the moon's diameter in miles Samaran measuring system is 2,160 this is where it gets really crazy 432 times itself squared is 186282 Sumerian miles per Sumerian seconds the actual speed of light he in miles per second is 18662416568 we start asking ourselves is like wow here's a bunch of correlated information coincidence off the chart is there a message that's trying to be conveyed there absolutely is we live in a harmonic Universe if geometry is the backbone of this energetic structure of our universe and as we have found that geometry reveals harmonics then if we live in a geometric Universe we also live in a harmonic universe and here's three harmonic Triads that are perfect they all go la la la most beautiful forms of Music in fact you could almost think we have been programmed to recognize these tones played together as a clue that we're receiving information that is correct or makes us feel good let's look at nature let's look at the geometry of nature here's a shell this pattern is called a Fibonacci spiral this Fibonacci spiral is expressed all over the place in nature around us it spins forward it spins backwards and then if it spins against itself both forwards and backwards you create a pattern called the pineal pattern in pineal the words pine cone and pineapple and pine tree and you have a pineal gland pineal gland in your brain all has this exact pattern and that is a Fibonacci spiral going one way against a Fibonacci spiral counter rotating against it it is virtually the architecture of most of Life as We Know of on this planet here's a same thing spiral our galaxy our Milky Way galaxy is a Fibonacci spiral rather than very small very large so what if we took the mathematics of the Fibonacci spiral and applied frequency to those mathematic numbers it would be very easy to do let's take the Fibonacci spiral that is all in nature all the way out to Galaxy size and let's apply numbers to it you start with a number it doesn't matter what number you start with but if you start here at the you see the 144 down in the bottom right that that's just picking an arbitrary number like that's a signature frequency of a plant and out of the moment that that plant is birthed out of that right corner of that right hand 144 0 plus 144 is 144 again 144 + 144 is 288 144 plus 28 288 is 432 288 + 432 is 720 and on into Infinity well if we play those tones those mathematical placeholders as frequencies incredibly we are right back to numerically perfect harmonics so now we're really on the path of some incredible discovery about the essence and is there a reason believe there is a harmonic Essence to life on our planet absolutely because we take the first steps of growth of a Fibonacci spiral that launches everything from small spirals to Big the first six steps will reveal that exact same harmonically perfect Triad well here's a u a document written 6,000 years ago it's the Samaran Kings list so this is written in cuniform 6,000 years ago it is writing about these Kings these rulers that lived in the region for tens of thousands of years each before a great flood consumed the planet what I found interesting is the first three kings lived for 288 360 and 432 with zeros behind it literally encoded in this king's list one of the most famous pieces of uniform on our planet that we have ever decoded and the first three kings the holy Trinity is the same harmonic numbers and it's a different chord it's 288 360 432 but the same mathematically perfect intervals between them this is an incredible another incredible moment of realization that we have been actually gifted in hard copies not just in stories but in hard copies that lasted for 6,000 years codes and keys that will get us back to these numerically perfect harmonics let's look at these Sky visitors on this mural this is a mural that has been shaved off of a wall in Samaria but let's look at these what archaeologists tell us are farmers you know with their little seed bags and standing by a plant and that's the sun overhead up in the upper left of the slide look at and the upper right look at these two guys holding these pine cones as archaeologists want us to believe well 6,000 years ago Samaria was a desert then as it is now there was no pine cones but let's look really close at what he's holding not holding a pine cone he's holding the same thing that's in the Vatican right dead center in the middle of the vanan looks like a pine cone we see this pine cone at top the twin Snakes the caducus activating a pine cone so what is it that pine cone is our pineal gland they are holding that pineal gland actually up against the head of the humanoid form in front of them as if this machine is somehow doing something to these pine cones again giving us a very visual clue of what might be happening so the supposition is all this information what could it be leading us to the tone set and this awareness of geometry might be activating our pineal gland that's inside of every brain every mammal has a pineal gland and it could be the basis for Instinct in some mammals it could be the basis for migration in some animals but in humans philosophers from Renee Dart to Modern uh artists like Alex Gray who painted this would say no the pineal gland is our antenna that is receiving information from the universe as to who and what we really are and we are just we've either been ignored or it has been switched off and we are in the process these last 6,000 years of trying to switch it on through the codes and the keys and the geometric riddles that were gifted to us what happens when our pineal gland is activated we become aware we become conscious and a symbol of Consciousness in many cultures is the lotus flower another code or clue perhaps we're familiar with we've seen the lotus flower as a representation of Awakening and Enlightenment well here's simatics here is a scientific study of holding in a fluid or you can even do it with loose grains of sand or powder apply frequency to it and you will get standing waveforms and then you can take a picture of it and see this incredible geometry behind it well I went to a simatics lab and I played the three tones of the Samaran Kings list and the frequency tones of sacred geometry we played both look what they revealed that is a still shot of the patterning that came through when we played the 28 8 36432 the researchers that had been doing research with simatics for years had never seen something like this it is like 3D it looks like a lotus flower you can see petals hiding behind other petals deeper you go they're like this is incredible and no one has seen something like this in simatics research before so here's another coincidental reason to believe that all of this imagery showing pineal patterning or the lotus flower with these frequency sets that were gifted to us is actually doing something like activating our pineal gland and allowing us to see this Lotus of awareness my theory became that we might be living in a giant earth-sized escape room and if you're not familiar with an escape what an escape room is it's a form of entertainment you go to a real location you get locked into it uh with either yourself or a team and clues are inside the escape room but you don't even know what the clues are you have to start researching things so you'll see a clock you see it says 4438 you might look for those numbers exposed somewhere else but it's encoded with things that if you figure out all the clues and employ them correctly solve the puzzles you get to escape it's like they were cheat codes provided to you in advance by the Builders of the escape room to allow you to uplevel to the next level and what I think we could be living in in what many astrophysicists believe in we're living in a holographic existence and that we might be have been getting numerical Keys and codes and clues that will allow us to break through to the next level "
