"Southern Iraq 2022 archaeologists from the British museum are Excavating the ancient site of gerso when they uncover ancient walls made of mud bricks it would soon be determined that these walls were part of two temples built roughly 4500 years ago to venerate the Samaran God n Guru they announced the discovery of the Lord Palace of the Kings and the white Thunderbird Temple now these are mythical sites that have been looked for for Generations these were only recorded in tablets and text previously and the whole Thunderbird Mythos is related to ningu ningu was a Thunderbird that was like the Avatar of this kind of great God the reason why this Temple was instructed is that a king of the local city state had had a series of dreams about the God ningu the story of the Thunderbird God ningu comes from the account of King guda the same King whose statues were found at this very site in 1877 discovered alongside those statues were the largest cuniform cylinders yet to discovered inscribed by King Gia himself Gia wrote that the giant Wayne God Nuru instructed him to build these two temples to honor him the archaeologists themselves say that this Temple was built due to a vision that a man had uh where a gigantic Thunderbird descended from the sky and personally I think that this has to do with extra terrest Ral because if you know nothing about high technology and somebody descends from the sky in a vehicle well of course you're going to signify a person with wings because they came from the sky could it be that King's account of a giant wi deity was in fact an encounter with some type of aerial vehicle carrying an extraterrestrial visitor ancient astronaut theorists say yes and suggest further evidence that the Sumerians witnessed alien craft coming down from the sky can be found in the Epic of gilgames in the Epic of gilgames gilgames encounters the Anunnaki at what's called The Landing Place The Landing place is where the gods came to meet with gilgames in the text it talks about sort of a a ship that goes from here to the heavens in the ancient world that's the gods who are transporting the in chariots you know in the modern world is that a spacecraft is that a rocket ship gilgames was watching the gods descending and ascending from the planet he actually talks about hearing loud sounds and seeing fire and smoke as the gods took off into the heavens to me this sounds exactly like a rocket ship in his book the 12th Planet Samaran researcher Zechariah siten proposed that the landing Place described in the epic poem is a megalithic site that can be visited to this day according to sit the actual location is balbec in Lebanon where we find this massive platform that resembles what we would think of as a landing port today most people know bbec as being the site of the Roman Temple of Jupiter built in the first century BC but beneath the temple is a massive Stone platform that is believed to have been built thousands of years earlier it is constructed from megalithic blocks that weigh as much as 800 metric tons or 1.6 million PB that platform is incredible because it features some of the largest Stones ever carved and created by humans long ago these blocks are on the fourth level up so somehow they had to be lifted up and in my opinion they had a technology imparted to the local population by the extraterrestrials as far as ancient astronaut theorists are concerned the story of the landed pad in the Epic of Gilgamesh along with kinga's encounter with a giant winged being strongly suggest that the Samaran people witnessed flying craft coming down from the sky and they say the most compelling detail of all is the Samaran description of the God ningu as a Thunderbird when I hear that a giant Thunderbird person descended from the sky I'm like wait a second we've heard these stories before in North America many First Nation myths begin with Thunderbirds that Thunderbirds existed out of which the so-called kachinas came and the kachinas were the first Bringers of knowledge you have other stories like that also in Ancient India imagine you know nothing about technology and then you see a big plane fly over your head well first of all it looks like a bird and second of all it makes a lot of noise thundering noise so of course you would call that a Thunderbird and that to me illustrates an example of misunderstood technology [Music] "
