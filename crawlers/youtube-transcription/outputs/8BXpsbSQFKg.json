"It is commonly said that China is one of the\u00a0\noldest continuously existing civilizations in\u00a0\u00a0 the world. However, if you took a modern\u00a0\nChinese person, or even a subject of the\u00a0\u00a0 Middle Kingdom\u2019s medieval dynasties, and\u00a0\ntransplanted them into China\u2019s ancient bronze age,\u00a0\u00a0 they would likely find the people of\u00a0\nthat time utterly alien in language,\u00a0\u00a0 religion and custom. In this video, we will\u00a0\nbe examining the earliest origins of one of\u00a0\u00a0 the world\u2019s most esteemed civilizations, with\u00a0\nan emphasis on the Kingdoms of Shang and Zhou,\u00a0\u00a0 exploring exactly how far back in history a\u00a0\nrecognizably Chinese culture can be traced.

While it is said that Chinese\u00a0\nhistory is 5,000 years old,\u00a0\u00a0 many of its iconic features are comparatively much\u00a0\nmore recent. For example, the mandate of heaven,\u00a0\u00a0 the beating heart of Chinese historiography which\u00a0\nframes the rise and fall of Imperial dynasties,\u00a0\u00a0 did not crystallize into a solid concept\u00a0\nuntil the rise of the Zhou around 3,000 years\u00a0\u00a0 ago. Meanwhile, staples of Chinese social\u00a0\ndoctrine, like Confucianism and Buddhism,\u00a0\u00a0 only started becoming mainstream parts of society\u00a0\nduring the Han dynasty of around 2,000 years ago.\u00a0\u00a0 Throughout history, the territory, religions,\u00a0\ncultures and languages that constitute \u201cChina\u201d\u00a0\u00a0 have undergone massive change, which problematizes\u00a0\nthe idea of China as a linearly continuous 5,000\u00a0\u00a0 year old civilization. So, how far back can one\u00a0\ngo can still see something recognizably \u2018Chinese?\u2019\u00a0 As it is with myriad other nations, the origins\u00a0\nof Chinese civilization in the popular narrative\u00a0\u00a0 is shrouded in fantastic folklore, replete\u00a0\nwith various mythical Emperors and Sage Kings\u00a0\u00a0 possessed of various supernatural powers.\u00a0\nPerhaps the most famous of these is Yu the Great,\u00a0\u00a0 who around 4,000 years ago stopped a devastating\u00a0\nflood of the Yellow River by personally dredging\u00a0\u00a0 it with his superhuman strength. Thereafter, Yu\u00a0\nbecame the first ruler of a hereditary domain,\u00a0\u00a0 known as the Xia, traditionally considered to be\u00a0\nChina\u2019s first dynasty. In modern historiography,\u00a0\u00a0 Yu, and the Xia dynasty have been consigned\u00a0\nto the realm of myth and folklore, as little\u00a0\u00a0 archaeological evidence and no literary\u00a0\nrecords from this primordial era survives.\u00a0 With that said, modern archaeology has discovered\u00a0\nvarious prehistoric material culture complexes\u00a0\u00a0 along the Yangtze and Yellow rivers dating\u00a0\nback at least 4,000 years, such as the Erlitou\u00a0\u00a0 culture. These societies may well have ties\u00a0\nto the myth of Yu and his predecessors,\u00a0\u00a0 especially since they were farming cultures who\u00a0\nrelied on the capricious flow of the Yellow River.\u00a0\u00a0 However, as they were pre-literate communities,\u00a0\nand left no written record of themselves, we have\u00a0\u00a0 no way of knowing if they were the cultural\u00a0\nor linguistic predecessors of the Chinese.\u00a0 Let us now set the clock to the dying years\u00a0\nof China\u2019s last imperial dynasty. In 1899,\u00a0\u00a0 a malaria epidemic erupted in Beijing. At\u00a0\nthe time, it was believed that the cure\u00a0\u00a0 to this disease was to grind up ancient\u00a0\ndragon bones and mak e a soup from them.\u00a0\u00a0 Taking advantage of this fad, peasants from\u00a0\nAnyang village in Henan Province began digging\u00a0\u00a0 old ox bones and turtle shells out of the\u00a0\nground and passing them off as dragon remains.\u00a0\u00a0 Many of these bones had odd scratchings on them.\u00a0\nFearing these marrings would lower their value,\u00a0\u00a0 the peasants of Anyang smoothed them off\u00a0\nbefore selling them. However, some of these\u00a0\u00a0 specimens soon circulated into the hands of\u00a0\na scholar, who realized something remarkable:\u00a0\u00a0 these etchings were, infact, a hitherto unknown\u00a0\nform of ancient Chinese writing, so different\u00a0\u00a0 from the modern Chinese script that the peasants\u00a0\nhad no clue what they were defacing. Henceforth,\u00a0\u00a0 archaeologists flooded into Anyang, and discovered\u00a0\nsomething remarkable: an ancient settlement, and\u00a0\u00a0 3,200 year old seat of the royal house of Shang.\nThe Shang state, which extended over only a small\u00a0\u00a0 portion of modern China, is considered the\u00a0\nfirst historically attested Chinese polity\u00a0\u00a0 because unlike the Xia state which supposedly\u00a0\npredated them by centuries, the Shang left\u00a0\u00a0 behind an observable written record in the form of\u00a0\nthose aforementioned bones. Known to scholars as\u00a0\u00a0 \u2018oracle bones\u2019, the archaic characters written\u00a0\nupon them represent questions posed by the people\u00a0\u00a0 of Shang to the spirits, such as if the lady of\u00a0\ntheir royal family would give birth to a son,\u00a0\u00a0 whether they should attack neighboring\u00a0\ntribes, or whether sacrifices should be made.\u00a0\u00a0 The oracle bones were then tossed into a fire,\u00a0\nand the manner in which the heat cracked the bone\u00a0\u00a0 along the writing determining the spirit\u2019s answer.\nFew in the historical community deny that the\u00a0\u00a0 3,200 year old remains found at Anyang represent\u00a0\na culture directly ancestral to modern China.\u00a0\u00a0 The most glaring testament to this lies\u00a0\nin their written languages. The runes\u00a0\u00a0 etched onto Shang oracle bones represent clear,\u00a0\narchaic versions of modern Chinese characters,\u00a0\u00a0 which allows us to infer that, at least\u00a0\namongst their elite and priestly castes,\u00a0\u00a0 their spoken language was ancestral\u00a0\nto today\u2019s Chinese dialects as well.\u00a0 Moreover, our limited window into Shang\u00a0\nspiritualism reveals many familiar\u00a0\u00a0 Chinese features. As is still the case in\u00a0\nmany contemporary households in Taiwan,\u00a0\u00a0 Hong Kong and the mainland, the worship of family\u00a0\nancestors was a core pillar of Shang society.\u00a0\u00a0 Shang Kings in particular appeared to draw their\u00a0\npower from the spirits of their royal ancestors.\u00a0\u00a0 Through this, a hierarchy existed, in which\u00a0\nthe long dead outranked the recently dead,\u00a0\u00a0 who outranked the Shang King, who outranked\u00a0\nall other living humans. The importance of\u00a0\u00a0 ancestors is further emphasized in how the Shang\u00a0\ncreated great sacrificial vessels out of bronze,\u00a0\u00a0 in which was placed wine and various cooked dishes\u00a0\nfor the enjoyment of their long deceased kin.\u00a0\u00a0 On top of human ancestors, the Shang also\u00a0\nworshiped a variety of nature spirits,\u00a0\u00a0 and had a chief deity, Di, who determined the\u00a0\nnatural order and the fate of Kingdoms. Di,\u00a0\u00a0 whose name shares the modern Chinese character for\u00a0\n\u2018Emperor\u2019, would play an incredibly important role\u00a0\u00a0 in the Chinese psyche for millenia to come.\nIn government, the Shang polity also seems to\u00a0\u00a0 have resembled an early version\u00a0\nof later Chinese statecraft.\u00a0\u00a0 The ancient Shang were ruled by a hereditary\u00a0\nmonarch and his royal family, which presided\u00a0\u00a0 over a bureaucratic court of appointed individuals\u00a0\nwith specialized departments of responsibility.\u00a0\u00a0 This can be seen as a precursor to the highly\u00a0\ncentralized courts of later Chinese dynasties\u00a0\u00a0 such as the Han, Song, and Qing which would\u00a0\nemerge thousands of years down the line.\u00a0\u00a0 Indeed, the literati of those later\u00a0\ndynasties considered the Shang to be\u00a0\u00a0 their direct cultural predecessors. For example,\u00a0\nin his sweeping work on the history of China,\u00a0\u00a0 the historian Sima Qian of the Han dynasty\u00a0\nwrote a genealogical account of the house of\u00a0\u00a0 Shang, in which he names several of their Kings,\u00a0\nincluding Wu Ding, who reigned around the time the\u00a0\u00a0 city at Anyang was at its height. However, unlike\u00a0\nhis accounting of the Yellow Emperor and the Xia,\u00a0\u00a0 Sima Qian\u2019s attestations of the Shang can be\u00a0\ncorroborated with hard archaeological evidence,\u00a0\u00a0 as the names of the Shang Kings he writes about\u00a0\nalso appear on the oracle bones found at Anyang.\u00a0 With all that said, the Shang Kingdom was still\u00a0\na drastically different state than what one would\u00a0\u00a0 expect from a typical Chinese dynasty, with many\u00a0\nfeatures of Shang society not considered part of\u00a0\u00a0 conventional Chinese cultural continuity. For one\u00a0\nthing, Shang gender roles appear very different\u00a0\u00a0 from the later Chinese norm. This is exemplified\u00a0\nby the perhaps the most remarkable of finds at the\u00a0\u00a0 Anyang archaeological site: the tomb of Lady Hao.\u00a0\nFound interred in a massive mausoleum alongside\u00a0\u00a0 thousands of ornate luxuries of jade, ivory and\u00a0\nbronze, Fu Hao was one of the sixty-four consorts\u00a0\u00a0 of the aforementioned King Wu Ding. However,\u00a0\nfar from lounging around in a royal harem, Fu\u00a0\u00a0 Hao was a renowned warrior who led her own armies\u00a0\nand launched conquests into neighboring states,\u00a0\u00a0 all while owning and administering her own lands\u00a0\noutside the capital, essentially making her a\u00a0\u00a0 critical member of the Shang military aristocracy.\u00a0\nWhile many famous women would serve as warriors\u00a0\u00a0 throughout Chinese history, the remains of\u00a0\nFu Hao is evidence that in the Shang realm,\u00a0\u00a0 female fief-holders and military leaders were\u00a0\na normalized part of the state apparatus,\u00a0\u00a0 a highly unusual idea for China\u2019s later\u00a0\ndynasties, for whom, at least ostensibly,\u00a0\u00a0 women were far less politically active.\nIn her campaigns, Fu Hao took many captives\u00a0\u00a0 from foreign tribes, who would then be used as\u00a0\nritual victims in cult rites. This brings us\u00a0\u00a0 to the topic of human sacrifice, a gruesome staple\u00a0\nof Shang religion. The mass slaughter of hundreds,\u00a0\u00a0 if not thousands of captives was a\u00a0\ncommon occurrence at the Shang capital,\u00a0\u00a0 and while human sacrifice would persist for some\u00a0\ncenturies after the Shang\u2019s eventual collapse,\u00a0\u00a0 it would become a taboo and ultimately abolished\u00a0\npractice by the time of the Han dynasty.\u00a0 Perhaps the largest thing holding the Shang\u00a0\napart from later Chinese dynasties was that\u00a0\u00a0 in all likelihood, its demographic makeup was\u00a0\nhardly Chinese to begin with. Deep in antiquity,\u00a0\u00a0 the area that is now modern China was far more\u00a0\nethnically and linguistically diverse than today,\u00a0\u00a0 with vast swathes of it inhabited by speakers\u00a0\nof non-Chinese tongues potentially ancestral\u00a0\u00a0 to todays\u2019 Viet, Thai, and Tibetan languages,\u00a0\namong many others. This was likely the case\u00a0\u00a0 even in the Shang\u2019s Yellow River valley heartland.\u00a0\nThus, while later Chinese dynasties ruled during\u00a0\u00a0 eras where the Chinese language and writing system\u00a0\nhad assimilated more evenly across the land, the\u00a0\u00a0 Shang state resembled more a deeply multicultural\u00a0\nfeudal confederacy, with the ancestrally Chinese\u00a0\u00a0 writing system seen on their oracle bones used\u00a0\nmainly by their elite caste and royal house.\u00a0\u00a0 To add on to this, Shang Kings seem\u00a0\nto have led highly mobile lives,\u00a0\u00a0 constantly riding around to ensure the loyalty\u00a0\nof their many militant confederates. This is\u00a0\u00a0 a big contrast to later Chinese Emperors, who\u00a0\nwere largely confined to their massive palaces.\u00a0 It therefore follows that the Shang were\u00a0\nconstantly absorbing foreign influences\u00a0\u00a0 into their culture. The use of chariots in\u00a0\nwar, for example, was likely adopted from an\u00a0\u00a0 indo-European speaking Caucasian people, native\u00a0\nto the modern Xinjiang desert, and ancestrally\u00a0\u00a0 related to many of todays\u2019 European and Northern\u00a0\nIndian populations. Later Chinese dynasties would,\u00a0\u00a0 of course, absorb cultural practices from\u00a0\ntheir non-Chinese neighbors too. However,\u00a0\u00a0 while from the Han Dynasty onwards, Chinese\u00a0\nhigh culture was the sun around which all\u00a0\u00a0 east Asia orbited around, during the Shang\u00a0\nDynasty, the proto-Chinese world was but one\u00a0\u00a0 of many mid-sized realms, likely no more or less\u00a0\ninfluential than many other states in the region.\u00a0 Ultimately, the Shang polity\u2019s relationship to the\u00a0\ncultural continuity of Chinese civilization is a\u00a0\u00a0 complex one. It is perhaps best described as a\u00a0\nChinese state that existed before Chinese culture\u00a0\u00a0 had become aware of its own identity and special\u00a0\nnature. A good historical parallel could be early\u00a0\u00a0 Rome when it was but a small city-state among the\u00a0\nmany diverse peoples of the Italian Peninsula,\u00a0\u00a0 oblivious to the thousands of years of deeply\u00a0\nestablished Imperial tradition it was starting.\u00a0\u00a0 For China, the core of those\u00a0\nImperial traditions would begin\u00a0\u00a0 with the successors of the Shang, the Zhou.\nOriginally, the Zhou were one of the Shang\u2019s\u00a0\u00a0 many vassals. They were a semi-nomadic people,\u00a0\nand perhaps speakers of a non-Chinese language.\u00a0\u00a0 If tradition is to be believed, then around\u00a0\n1100 BC, their King, Wen, pursued a deliberate\u00a0\u00a0 acculturation policy to make his people imitate\u00a0\nthe language and patterns of the prestigious\u00a0\u00a0 Shang. So prosperous and powerful did King Wen\u00a0\nbecome that he began to outshine his overlord.\u00a0\u00a0 When he died in 1050 BC, his son and heir, King\u00a0\nWu, would bring tensions with the Shang to a head.\u00a0\u00a0 If the hilariously anachronistic account of Sima\u00a0\nQian is to be believed, then he accomplished\u00a0\u00a0 this in a single morning, slaughtering over\u00a0\n500,000 loyal Shang soldiers in the process.\u00a0 King Wu of Zhou had overthrown the house of\u00a0\nShang, but establishing rule over the multitudes\u00a0\u00a0 of vassal states the Shang had once controlled\u00a0\nwould be no easy feat. The Zhou needed to make\u00a0\u00a0 a case as to why the tribes who had once bowed\u00a0\nto the Shang now owed their loyalty to this new\u00a0\u00a0 house of overlords. To that end, they utilized\u00a0\nthe chief Shang god Di, rebranding him as Tian,\u00a0\u00a0 which directly translates to \u2018sky\u2019, but is\u00a0\ngenerally translated in English as \u2018heaven\u2019.\u00a0\u00a0 King Wu and his successors promoted the idea that\u00a0\ntheir ascension to power had occurred only because\u00a0\u00a0 almighty Heaven, ever omnipotently controlling\u00a0\nthe fate of the civilized world, had deemed it\u00a0\u00a0 to be so. Furthermore, if the last Shang King\u00a0\nhad not been so ruthless, corrupt, or depraved,\u00a0\u00a0 then Heaven would not have seen fit to cast\u00a0\nhim down and replace him with a new ruler. Thus\u00a0\u00a0 was born one of the longest enduring political\u00a0\nphilosophies in the world, the mandate of heaven.\u00a0 This philosophy might have died in the crib, if\u00a0\nnot for the fact that, when King Wu of Zhou died\u00a0\u00a0 in 1043 BC, a rebellion broke out in an attempt\u00a0\nto overthrow his heir, who was a powerless child.\u00a0\u00a0 This rebellion was put down by one of the late\u00a0\nKing\u2019s brothers, known to history as the Duke of\u00a0\u00a0 Zhou. After emerging victorious, the Duke of Zhou\u00a0\ncould easily have deposed his underage nephew and\u00a0\u00a0 ruled himself, but he didn\u2019t, and ensured the son\u00a0\nof King Wu was restored to his rightful throne,\u00a0\u00a0 because it was the child who had been given Tian\u2019s\u00a0\nmandate, not he. This set the precedent that the\u00a0\u00a0 Mandate of Heaven, by which monarchs could only\u00a0\nbe deposed by divine will, not human machinations,\u00a0\u00a0 would become a real and active force in\u00a0\nChinese politics for millenia to come.\u00a0 If Shang was an archaic, dubiously Chinese state\u00a0\nnot yet aware of its own nature, then the Zhou\u00a0\u00a0 was when that awareness began to truly blossom,\u00a0\nand the prestige of cultural continuity began to\u00a0\u00a0 cement in the minds of the Chinese literati.\u00a0\nMany elements of Shang courtly life, such as\u00a0\u00a0 ancestor worship, divination through bones, and\u00a0\nthe written language, were directly continued by\u00a0\u00a0 the Zhou royal family, however, the Zhou pushed\u00a0\nthe boundaries of their realm further than the\u00a0\u00a0 Shang ever had, thereby expanding the influence\u00a0\nof an ever-evolving written Chinese language,\u00a0\u00a0 all while improving on the efficiency of the\u00a0\nChinese feudal bureaucracy seeded by the Shang,\u00a0\u00a0 and maintaining their prestige with all\u00a0\nmanner of religious and cultural rites.\u00a0 In theory, the Zhou Dynasty was the\u00a0\nlongest lasting of all Chinese dynasties,\u00a0\u00a0 clocking in at nearly 800 years. In practice,\u00a0\nits power was effectively crippled about 200\u00a0\u00a0 years into its rule, when the Quanrong,\u00a0\nlikely a group of Tibeto-Burman nomads,\u00a0\u00a0 sacked their western capital in 771 BC, forcing\u00a0\nthem to move their power base east, ultimately\u00a0\u00a0 losing control over their vassals and becoming one\u00a0\nof many fractureous Chinese states in the ensuing\u00a0\u00a0 Spring and Autumn period and warring states eras.\nNevertheless, compared to the Shang, the Zhou era\u00a0\u00a0 occupies a titanic place in the Chinese peoples\u2019\u00a0\nconcept of their own cultural continuity. Even a\u00a0\u00a0 certain Confucius, who was born in the 6th century\u00a0\nBC, 200 years after the collapse of Zhou unity,\u00a0\u00a0 predicated his entire philosophy on a nostalgia\u00a0\nfor the enlightened rule of the wise Zhou Kings of\u00a0\u00a0 eld, wishing to return to a time when their proper\u00a0\nritual and observance of heaven\u2019s will defined\u00a0\u00a0 Chinese statecraft, rather than the capricious\u00a0\nwarring armies of the divided China he lived in.\u00a0\u00a0 Centuries later still, when Buddhism arrived to\u00a0\nChina via the silk road in the late Han Dynasty,\u00a0\u00a0 many Chinese literati questioned why this strange,\u00a0\nforeign Indian religion should be allowed to take\u00a0\u00a0 root in their ancient and prestigious culture.\u00a0\nIn response, Chinese Buddhists drew upon the\u00a0\u00a0 lessons of the Duke of Zhou to explain\u00a0\nwhy their faith had a place in society.\u00a0 All of this serves to route us\u00a0\nback to our original question:\u00a0\u00a0 how far back in time can one go, and\u00a0\nsee a recognizably \u2018Chinese\u2019 state?\u00a0\u00a0 Based on the information explored in our video,\u00a0\nwe can confidently conclude that the answer is\u00a0\u00a0 a definitive \u2018it depends\u2019. As we have seen, the\u00a0\nidea of what Chinese culture is is ever evolving,\u00a0\u00a0 constantly absorbing foreign influences, while old\u00a0\ncultural elements evolve internally or fade away.\u00a0\u00a0 If one considers the most archaic written language\u00a0\nand courtly rituals sufficient, then China begins\u00a0\u00a0 with the Shang, but if one believes China needs\u00a0\nto be aware of its own cultural continuity to be\u00a0\u00a0 China, then it only truly begins with the Zhou.\u00a0\nIf Confucianism need to be part of the equation,\u00a0\u00a0 then we need to go even farther forward, and\u00a0\nthis is all before accounting for the many,\u00a0\u00a0 many diverse languages and cultures which have\u00a0\nexisted within the Chinese state apparatus\u00a0\u00a0 all throughout its history, whose members\u00a0\nmay interpret their place in Chinese history\u00a0\u00a0 differently than the elite Chinese-speaking\u00a0\nliterati. With all that said, that China is\u00a0\u00a0 a deeply storied civilization with incredibly\u00a0\nancient roots is a fact that cannot be challenged,\u00a0\u00a0 and regardless of how the way we interpret\u00a0\nher story involves, this will always be true.
