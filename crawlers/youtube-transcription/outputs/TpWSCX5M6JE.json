"after another a story of seduction the wrath of God and Paradise Lost but is it merely a favor is there evidence the great stories of the Bible might be true was there ever really such a place as Eden today the search for the Garden of Eden leads us to a dry and desolate land to a place called Mesopotamia [Music] this is the land where the first seeds of human civilization were sown and it was here that three of the greatest civilizations of the ancient world flourished Babylon Assyria and Sumer among their ruins the faithful of long sought answers to the Bible's most profound mysteries while archaeologists scoured these lands for the historical foundations of belief our quest for Eden as a journey back in time first to Babylon the last of these lost civilizations then further into

arc of the Fertile Crescent over the course of more than 6,000 years this rich land cradled between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers gave birth to the first great civilizations the Greeks called it Mesopotamia we call it Iraq by peeling back the layers of history here we can trace the origins of our oldest stories and travel back to the deepest roots of faith our journey begins on the western edge of Mesopotamia in Israel a chance discovery in 1947 would rivet the world's attention to archaeology and to the Bible to Bedouin shepherds are moving a herd of goats along the cliffs of Qumran a

along these books [Music] inside the cave the Shepherd discovers the wreckage of ancient pots leather scroll fragments and some papyrus sheets all untouched since the time of Jesus these writings by an obscure Jewish sect called the Essenes would come to be known throughout the world as the Dead Sea Scrolls in surrounding caves hundreds of ancient scrolls would eventually be unearthed one of them would prove to be the earliest known version of the Old Testament including the crucial first five books known to the Jews as the Torah the Dead Sea scrolls instantly became the focus of a tremendous

historical books as a matter of fact the earliest historical books that we have and quite accurate because we have cross references from other sources and they are found to be most very precise so

tradition it's a search that began in the Holy Land but would lead to Mesopotamia throughout history Crusaders mystics and believers have been drawn to sites where the great Bible stories took place but with the arrival of the 19th century a new kind of pilgrim sought to fortify their belief in the Bible through the infant science of archaeology surely there could be no greater confirmation of their faith than to prove that biblical history was true the first aim of the biblical archaeologists was to locate sites mentioned prominently in the biblical narratives and to see if any

1868 deep in the land of Moab Bedouins zuv the bonny Hamid a tribe stumbled onto a mysterious stone tablet buried in the desert the tribesmen were no strangers to the antiquities of the area or to

highly prized by Europeans must contain gold they dumped the stone into a fire in an attempt to break it apart as fire heated the stone they poured water over it again and again until finally it exploded they found no gold and the stone was destroyed the first archaeological confirmation of a Bible story the first corroborating evidence ever found in the Holy Land was shattered the loss of the stone was devastating but it didn't end the biblical treasure hunt now that the Bible itself was verified as history it pointed the way even further into the past back more than 2500 years ago to a great Empire ruled from Babylon to the very moment the Bible itself was born the year is 586 BC the armies of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon descend on Jerusalem with the wrath of an angry god it is almost 6 centuries before the birth of Christ the Romans have not yet even dreamed of Empire it is a dark chapter in the history of the Jews while babylons fierce star is rising the Bible describes the Babylonian attack homes are pillaged King Solomon's Temple is set ablaze and utterly destroyed ten thousand Israelite captives princes soldiers artisans and scribes all are led to Babylon in Chains the Israelites crossed more than 500 miles of desert following ancient trade routes across modern-day Jordan Syria and Iraq to Babylon in Psalms 137 the Israelites lament by the rivers of Babylon there we sat down and wept when we remembered Zion how shall we sing the Lord's song in a foreign land broken and exhausted the Israelites entered Babylon in awe of his scope and frenzy torn from the modest city of Jerusalem they beheld the majestic capital of the ancient world but somehow the Israelites managed to do more than sing the Lord's song in this foreign land they also wrote it down if you look at any piece of oral literature and then you write it down you're formalizing it you're immediately setting down a text which people can criticize or can say this is the truth everything else is wrong that I think is the biggest effect of writing down the Bible or the Old Testament today the reconstructed walls surrounding Babylon are stamped with the name Saddam Hussein but once the bricks bore another name King Nebuchadnezzar this was a land of many gods and pagan idols an unlikely birthplace for one of the world's most sacred texts yet babylons great diversity created the perfect climate and they come into this cause important and bound even the most educated among them and literate among them were being bombarded with the wet contact with other people and I mean other people the Israelites found themselves in a melting pot of different races and languages conflicting gods and alien demons what city is this the book of Revelation would ask clothed in purple and scarlet and decked with gold and pearls the habitation of devils and the hold of every foul spirit Babylon the great mother of harlots and the abominations of the earth but among all the abominations even perhaps because of them this was where the Bible first became a book threatened by an overwhelming new culture Hebrew scribes were desperate to preserve and solidify Jewish identity over three generations of captivity the scribes unified Israel's oral tradition new writings and sacred texts into a single manuscript the Bible was born fortunately for them the Babylonians were pretty liberal they allowed to them to keep their own culture their own religion to study their own books this is what preserved the Bible to this very day but as the books of the Bible came together over the long years of Exile Babylonian culture would profoundly influence the work of the Israelite scribes these 'fl fairly literate people I suspect many of the people who went into exile and scribes talked to scribes and I'm sure that was how a lot of information was transmitted and the exchange of ideas and knowledge must have been I would use the word devastating it must have been mind-blowing the Bible would eventually reflect stories and traditions from Babylon and even earlier Mesopotamian civilizations the Israelites couldn't easily ignore babylons thriving culture and great monuments it's temples were among the largest structures in the ancient world being public buildings a ceremonial walkway Palace of Nebuchadnezzar but it's legendary Hanging Gardens arm trees gorilla if you had walked through the Ishtar Gate he would have felt the wolfed and this was deliberate you were in the presence of something powerful but on all sides of it was the city the people the commoners narrow winding alleyways rows and rows of small stores donkeys brain crowds of people walking small closely met quarters teeming with life and it was here the Bible tells us that one of Antiquities most extraordinary monuments soared into the sky the Tower of Babel for ages adventurers and pilgrims hoped that finding the famous tower would prove the truth of Bible stories one seeker who failed would write no man Durst go near to the tower for what is all desert and full of dragons and great serpents and full of diverse venomous beasts medieval travelers claimed they had found the tower this spiral minaret still standing in northern Iraq but they were wrong this tower was built 1,500 years too late and far from the walls of Babylon perhaps the most intriguing possibility was posed by Robert called away a German archaeologist in the early 1900's he discovered a rectangular ditch with only a few ancient bricks remaining many experts believe called away had found all that survives of the famous Tower Babylon's great monuments made a strong impression of the biblical scribes but her most enduring legacy surviving to this day is a Babylonian innovation far more impressive still the rule of law Babylon was the first civilization on earth to have a written legal code the original carved stone is an astonishing relic lost for hundreds of years it would emerge in the late 19th century a stone engraved with one of the most important legal documents of all time twelve hundred years before the Israelites were taken captive a Babylonian King had this stone carved with the laws that bear his name Hammurabi's code these writings can be read as precursors to the legal code in Exodus Leviticus and Deuteronomy in societies where knowledge and law is transmitted orally and dealt with orally precedent is terribly important when he got with him down the people who wrote it down had immense power Hammurabi's code has influenced nearly every civilization since Babylon today even some of its more primitive methods of judgment survived virtually intact Hammurabi described a ritual called the ordeal a painful even deadly test of guilt or innocence in some remote Bedouin tribes the ordeal is still practiced much as it was in the time of Hammurabi in this rare footage a holy man called the mabashi will judge the accused by examining their tongues after they lick a red-hot iron spoon these men have been accused of theft they must submit to the ordeal for be found guilty by default family members look on anxiously as the young men prepare themselves for the painful ritual that came proving a deal and commenting Lily what's the message water doesn't ease the pain it's meant to cleanse and purify the drinker and - ready him for judgement the holy man prays and then examines the singed tongues seeking a sign from God only the mabashi can divine guilt or innocence and he alone will determine the men's fate at last a verdict one man is found innocent to the great relief of his family the other is not as fortunate declared guilty he will be fined for his crime the ordeal is an intriguing modern-day echo of hammurabi but his laws reach even more directly into the present through the Bible thou shalt not bear false witness against a guy the ten commandments the foundation of biblical law and yet only the beginning of a complex set of codes and covenants central to the Old Testament [Music] and in these laws the clear voice of Hammurabi can still be heard Hammurabi set down laws he didn't innovate a great deal he merely set down in writing laws which had operated by president for hundreds if not thousands of years an eye for an eye a tooth for a tooth and principles like this many of which are still codified in law today but the babylon that shaped the bible and its laws had its roots in an even earlier civilization one that reached its peak seven centuries before Christ it was the brutal Empire of Assyria a place the Bible called a land bathed in blood [Music] deadliest of all Mesopotamian armies to sweep through the ancient world were the Assyrians in the Bible they are the ultimate symbol of bloody tyranny and ruthless oppression a hundred years before Nebuchadnezzar took the Israelites captive in Babylon the Bible tells us the Assyrian King Sennacherib attacked the lands of the Israelites in the second book of Kings the Bible says behold with the kings of Assyria have done to our lands destroying them utterly the Assyrians were ruled by despotic Kings they believed in absolute power now absolute power means krunk's law and absolute power almost invariably is kept in power by military efficiency and might and the Assyrians maintained an enormous ly powerful and efficient war machine and on the walls of the city and King's palaces were the Chronicles of some of our expeditions written in vainglorious grandiloquent terms the Assyrians they would take a city and they would stack up the heads of the leading citizens out beside the gate or they would take the king of the of the city and Flay him alive and nail his skin to the wall or something like that but everybody did that assyrian power symbolized by the royal lion hunt lay in the hands of merciless warrior kings [Music] even the Bible betrays grudging admiration behold of the Assyrian under his shadow dwelt all great nations Ezekiel 31 when the city of Rome was in its infancy Assyria was the greatest empire in the world for more than a thousand years details of Assyrian civilization were few even its great capital city of Nineveh was unknown to the modern world then in 1852 these desolate ruins were explored by British archaeologist Austen Henry Layard what Laird found here in northern Iraq was nothing less than the royal palace of Nineveh an unspoiled treasure of assyrian civilization tunnelling like a miner through the earth layered uncovered great winged Bulls and spectacular artistry hidden from human view for a millennium the world was stunned and excited by his breakthrough Nineveh was another biblical city found yet more confirmation of the Bible's historical accuracy but the most momentous of Layard discoveries was the great library of Nineveh an extraordinary collection of twenty-two thousand clay tablets inscribed with the cuneiform writing of the Assyrians the only direct communication that we have with people world really is what they left behind in their writings we can know from that what they ate what their medical treatments were what their family life was like what their politics was like how they viewed religion details of Assyrian daily life reveal a patriarchal society a world where commoners and especially women had little status every assyrian woman once in her early life before marriage would go to the temple of Ishtar and she would sit on the steps and she would wait there until some man came along and dropped a coin on the hem of her dress and then she would go inside with him and do her thing and that was it yet in this despotic world there was a kind of justice in marriage even a wife had certain rights a woman could specify in her marriage contract that her husband would have no other wives she might specify that he can have all the prostitutes he wanted but no otherwise but if ordinary women had only limited status recent discoveries reveal Assyrian queens enjoyed great privilege in 1989 the ancient palace of nimrod and northern iraq set the stage for a startling find experts called it the most significant discovery since King Tut's tomb the treasure of Nimrod while we were cleaning some of the rooms we discovered that there are some indications for revolting underneath the floor we took everything out and we tried to sort it and we discovered that we have here the bodies of at least two queens solid gold bracelets still adorned there bones a royal treasure entombed more than 2,000 years ago this remarkable footage shot by Iraqi archaeologists is an exclusive record of their extraordinary discoveries for the very first time the tomb of an Assyrian Queen had been uncovered intact the royal Sepulchre still displayed a curse to protect its occupants should anyone break open the seal and remove me from my tomb let his spirit roam in thirst under the bitter rays of the Sun and may the great gods of the underworld inflict his corpse and ghost with eternal restlessness ignoring the curse archaeologists excavated more than a hundred and twenty-five pounds of beautifully crafted jewelry crystal goblets and exquisite carvings the ancient Assyrians were master Goldsmith's and artisans but the value of this treasure far exceeds its worth and gold in death Assyrian queens were lavished with riches but in life it was her king whose will forged history kings with a taste for empire in the year 701 BC King Sennacherib and his army struck out across the desert toward the Mediterranean Sea the bold Assyrians were determined to conquer all that lay in their path the cities of Judah including Jerusalem and it's rebellious king hezekiah fortress after fortress fell to the Assyrians but it was the city of Lachish whose brutal destruction is best recorded in the historical record and in the Bible the siege of Lachish is a beautiful example of how an Assyrian army descended on a city surrounded it besieged it reduced it and took away its inhabitants to slavery those that were not executed men women and children their technique was very simple it was brutal conquest fast-moving conquest systematic efficient conquest and from the best beliefs in Assyrian palaces you see the siege engines the soldiers moving up the mounds or the shields above them protecting him from the debris thrown down below but they hadn't a hope in hell those guys were professional soldiers it was a machine from the capital city of Jerusalem King Hezekiah knew an Assyrian attack was inevitable he raced to fortify the city and ordered an underground aqueducts dug a desperate effort to protect the city's water supply in the face of a siege as a kaya's plan worked the Bible tells us the Lord saved Jerusalem and the king of Assyria returneth shamefaced to his own land Sennacherib version of the conflict was found on a clay prism unearthed at Nineveh it matches the Bible story down to the smallest details but it's point of view is sharply different but as for his Akaya the Jew who did not bow down in submission to my yoke 46 of his strong world towns i besieged and conquered the awful splendor of my lordship overwhelmed him stories are told from different angles but they are in agreement if you will have to tell about what happened today and I'll have to tell will tell different stories we have the story of Sennacherib invading to this country each tells basically about the same story van't with absolutely no contradictions no contradictions but one the result in sanik rubs version Hezekiah is shut up in Jerusalem like a caged bird but in the Bible the Assyrian armies are held back by Jerusalem's walls it is perhaps the earliest example of spin-doctors at work the god of the Israelites has the last word I will break the assyrian in my land the Bible says for through the voice of the Lord shall the Assyrian be beaten down Isaiah chapter 6 and the Bible tells us God does destroy Nineveh throne of the greatest Syrian kings it wasn't the first such annihilation long before the Almighty had laid waste an entire civilization there is not a single mention of their name in the Bible but they were called Sumer and they told the story of a great flood it's one of the most familiar of all Bible stories the saga of Noah's Ark an angry god a wooden boat I tell you it's the story of Noah and his family escaping to the ark with every species of animal and surviving the punishing flood while the rest of mankind is destroyed it's a primal tale stirring our deepest hopes and fears a story found in the Bible but also in another ancient text a text discovered in the ruins of Sumer early this century a group of Mesopotamian tablets were translated they revealed the earliest known legend of a cataclysmic flood the world's very first written epic it is the story of the mythic King Gilgamesh his tale of a Great Flood predates the Bible's by at least 2,000 years for seven days and seven nights the flood had slipped over the lab and the huge boat had been tossed about by the storms boat then ones wound on a mountain he sends out Birds which is the story which has an eerie similarity to the story of the Biblical Flood it's a wonderful story more than 5,000 years ago the story of the Great Flood was first told here in the ancient cities of Sumer Brooke era do and uh in Sumer we find the first of almost everything that makes us civilized they invented the wheel government and gardening Sumer the first civilization on earth in a land without stone they devised mud bricks like those still made and used today and from these simple building blocks they erected the first great monuments called ziggurats towering temples soaring hundreds of feet into the air the Sumerians invented the 62nd minute and even the troubled teenager where did you go I didn't go anywhere if you didn't go anywhere of why do you idle about go to school stand before your teacher recite your homework write your tablet do you understand me we know about the Sumerians they're startling innovations and their everyday lives thanks to their most impressive invention writing we know their ancient legends and their intimate secrets because someone wrote them down it was something no one had ever done before it's a window but it's a window that's composed of many pains some of which we can see through as long as we can't we we lack much more than we have so while what we have is spectacular in some cases we always have to bear in mind that there are parts of the daily lives of people that we can never see and which we may never see because they're people that those writing the tablets didn't care about 5,000 years ago someone etched their stories into Cley providing us with a glimpse of the world in the first blush of civilization as a people the Sumerians were in some ways much like ourselves they got concerned about meeting other people and drinking beer and so on and there are several collections of poems which relate the preparations of a woman for her lover and how she dresses and waits for her lover to come the center of Sumerian civilization was the lost city of or once thought to be the birthplace of Abraham first of the Bible's patriarchs [Music] it is the epitome of the biblical city and archaeological terms because it was the site of one of the most famous archeological digs ever carried out in the 1920s and 30s by a remarkable British archeologist called Leonard Woolley a British archeologist once described archaeology as the science of rubbish which is so true [Music] but give me the archaeologists who can make the stones and the bones and bricks and the pots come alive then of all he was like that he would take people on a tour of a small quarter of heard of the quarries where the house foundations were exposed and as you walked through he would talk about the lives of the people who lived in these houses talk about the ovens the sills the low ceilings the furniture and her in Willie's hands came alive will he dug this enormous pit and he went down to the city and it got smaller and smaller and then there was this deep sterile layer of silt and Willie himself recounts how his wife came over looked at it and she was a lava casual lady in somebody's looking said no well of course that's the flood and lights went off and Willie claimed that this was evidence of the biblical flood and it captured the popular imagination what did it do it brought in money and uh was a dig that was sold brilliantly [Music] speculation about the Biblical Flood caused a sensation even without solid proof It was as if science and the Bible had United in the Bleak desert of southern Iraq Willie would eventually unearth an indisputable treasure a discovery that provided extraordinary insight into this earliest of civilizations the royal tombs of or digging in the thick mud wooly uncovered 74 carefully arranged skeletons all entombed at the same time the burial told the shocking story of a king's final journey into the afterlife and of those who accompanied him and from this he developed a remarkable story of a pre-dynastic royal funeral and his story went something like this firstly dad was big pit with RAM inside in the pit they erected a Sepulchre stone in which body the wild personnage was placed then the entire court filed into the everybody lined up and stood there with two clay pots in their hands and then it's a signal they all drank poison lay down and died so the prince went to his grave accompanied by all his retainers this has become one of the great discovery is one of the great funeral accounts of archaeology and early history the discovery of the grave pizza door was a triumph of archaeology revealing ancient secrets of the first civilization but science alone can take us only so far where the trail ends the epic of gilgamesh provides the final tantalizing clues clues leading us back to a garden and a place some call paradise in the beginning God created the world it's a familiar story you get these sort of creation myths in almost every society on earth it's a really compelling longing of people for a better world gardens of Eden paradises are people's longing for a less complicated life or a life of ease or a reward for having worked so hard in the ancient Sumerian epic of gilgamesh the name given to paradises doorman it's a place beyond the edge of normal human habitation of us how it features in the Cimmerian admit that's where the flood survivor goes to live and there are other myths which feature Dillman as a place where everything was perfect Gillman figures in Mesopotamian legend as a swath of garden and evening as a sort of paradise a place verdant green and abundant Auto and cool winds and breezes it is a place of wonder a perfect place yet it is also home to a serpent in the ancient epic the snake steals away the flower that bestows immortality and so like Adam Gilgamesh must leave the garden and die the idea of paradise seems Universal but what is it based on was there ever really such a place the clues point to an enchanted yet very real location 400 miles south of the ancient Sumerian city of war lies the island of Bahrain a pivotal marketplace on the trade routes across the arid desert sand salt seas of Mesopotamia today Bahrain is something less than paradise but it was once lush once this island had abundant water and thus abundant life once long ago this was Dillman but was it paradise [Music] by comparison to the surrounding desert it would certainly have seemed so there was so much water here that what is now a desert island bloomed it was a garden bearing lush fruit and there were people here who apparently led a blessed life more than 85,000 burial mounds dot this landscape probably the most in any one location in the ancient world the ancient bones tell us these people were taller and healthier and they lived longer than anyone else in the region and in the burial mounds is one more astonishing clue the remains of snakes ritually embalm dat some lost moment more than 4,000 years ago here in Bahrain we find the serpent just as we found it in the epic of gilgamesh and just as we found it in the Bible our journey back in time has crossed the lands for the Babylonians the Assyrians and the ancient Sumerians once walked the earth is it possible to venture even farther to the land that conceals the very footsteps of Adam here faith and reasons to be found along these books [Music] inside the cave the Shepherd discovers the wreckage of ancient pots leather scroll fragments and some papyrus sheets all untouched since the time of Jesus these writings by an obscure Jewish sect called the Essenes would come to be known throughout the world as the Dead Sea Scrolls in surrounding caves hundreds of ancient scrolls would eventually be unearthed one of them would prove to be the earliest

was where the Bible first became a book threatened by an overwhelming new culture Hebrew scribes were desperate to preserve and solidified Jewish identity over three generations of captivity the scribes unified Israel's oral tradition new writings and sacred texts into a single manuscript the Bible was born fortunately for them the Babylonians were pretty liberal they allowed to them to keep their own culture their own religion to study their own books this is what preserved the Bible to this very day but as the books of the Bible came together over the long years of Exile Babylonian
