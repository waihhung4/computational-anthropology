"a mysterious artifact that was found early in the 20th century in the area uh that is known today as a rock this artifact was found and it is a it's they call it a prism but it's a a four-sided prism uh in cuniform if any of you can read cuniform it is called The Mysterious King's list how many of you familiar with it you're you're familiar with it so it it is m serious because it is a chronological list of rulers on the earth before the great flood and you'll see this in a moment as a geologist we can confirm I can confirm there was a great flood uh it happened at the end of the Ice Age when the ice melted the melting water flooded the large part of the earth so there was a great flood and then the Kings list continues after the great flood here's the mystery the great mystery what we know is that the listing of the names and the ages of the Kings is 100% accurate After the flood the ages that they lived the years they lived the ages they were when they died 100% accurate Before the Flood is where the mystery comes in because the lifespans are in terms of spans of time that we cannot fathom for a single Lifetime and the question the mystery is if the artifact is accurate After the flood why would it be flawed before or is it accurate before and it's telling us something about ourselves so want to take a look at this are you okay if we check this out it's it's pretty uh pretty amazing it was discovered in what now is is modern day Iraq U between 1900 1906 fragments were found and I wanted to say this to you after 1906 18 additional fragments were discovered and I'm saying that because it's not a one-off it's not like somebody had a fantasy and did this 18 other records existed to corroborate the original the original one so this was a very well documented list of ancient rulers it identifies eight rulers of ancient Sumer this name that was was given to Iraq now listen to this listen to where this goes eight I eight rulers their combined rule lasted 241,000 years before the flood so even if you don't even if you don't have your calculator eight rulers 241,000 years we're talking about some long lifetimes the longest single rule was measured in what we call a sar r s a r the longest rule was 12 SARS in length anybody know how long a sar is so you're going to learn something if you didn't learn anything else you're learning a brand new fact today AAR is scientifically validated and accepted and no question about this AAR is 3600 years in length one ruler lived 12 SARS all right the longest rule was 43,200 years now think about this all of the ages and the times are 100% accurate After the flood why would they be flawed Before the Flood or is it telling us something and I want to do I want you to actually see these are translations so here is I don't know if you can see on your monitors up there this is the name of one of the rulers in man Luana 12 Stars 432,000 years and then I I'll highlight this so you can see it right here on the text it says then the flood swept over after the flood had swept over so you're actually seeing the translation from what's on the what's on the the oblas there and and the kingship had descended from Heaven the kingship was in Kish Kish was the name of ancient Sumer that's what it used to be called so the rulers according to this document uh descended from another realm and it's in that realm apparently where their longevity was very different from the longevity that we have here so the question is is it fact or fiction is this like a story that somebody made up you know what what's going on here well as a geologist this is what I was mentioning I can tell you the history of the Earth from the ancient ice cores uh in Antarctica and Greenland we have a very accurate record of Earth's history includes climate change a whole story recorded in these ice cores of climate change that's very different from the story that we're being indoctrinated to accept in the world today the difference is this is based on science not politics so if you are interested in more of that I've got an entire Gaia series you can see I'm I'm happy to talk to you about it another time maybe in the Q&A or something but we can learn a lot from the history this is Earth revealing her history without uh without politics without uh corporate interests you know without religious interests this is Earth just telling us her story and her story is there was a flood and we know there was a great flood the flood resulted from the earth warming global warming melting the ice it happened about 177,000 years before present interestingly Kish in Mesopotamia uh was founded just about 177,000 years before present 16,781 years before present so Kish was there just before and existed during the time that the ice was melting so we know that's accurate we know the flood happened the ages After the flood After the flood the ages of people began to decline line After the flood so the ages range from 140 years of age to, 1500 years of age and this is where Biblical history comes in if you've ever studied uh the Patriarchs So Adam Adam is said to have lived to 930 Earth years uh Noah 950 I love the story of no Noah because Noah was 600 years old 600 years old when the flood happened happed and he built the boat that saved people and and and animals and after the flood he must have still been in pretty good shape because he started a new family at 600 years old so I have friends that are in their 60s that are saying well you know getting older things don't work like they used to yeah well that's why I don't want to go to my class reunion I know so the ages the ages of the Patriarchs Before the Flood this is what they were 950 years for Noah Adam was 930 Enoch was 95 uh I'm sorry well he was 365 Enoch but he didn't die he left there's a whole story behind Enoch but look at this after the flood the ages declined and you begin to see the biblical Patriarchs from uh living from 600 years down to only about 175 years so what you're seeing what you're seeing here is a chronology that looks outrageous to us we we have uh something that we know is true on here and that is the flood the flood happened we know that the ages of the Patriarchs on this document match the ages that we have revealed through historic past before what we don't know is what about those outrageous ages of the ones that came before could they have possibly lived in one body for that length of time now there a lot of controversy around this we don't know specifically the answer but here's the question is the chronology of the Kings Before the Flood accurate and is this list is the list a record of some rare extreme example of longevity or is it a reminder to us of our lost potential to heal in ways that we're only beginning to understand for extended lifetimes compared to what we have now a female relative of Albert Perry an African-American man from South Carolina submitted a sample of his DNA to a company called family tree to trace family Roots during the routine DNA analysis technicians at the genetic testing company made an extremely rare Discovery Albert Perry contained a y chromosome with a genetic signature like no other why chromosomes are the hereditary Factor determining the male sex Albert Perry revealed that the most recent common ancestor for his lineage was roaming the Earth about 338,000 years ago geneticists have been able to prove that all men tested thus far in these commercial databases can trace their Y chromosome to a common male ancestor labeled Adam that lived between 60,000 and 140,000 years ago this made his DNA over twice as old as any fossil on record for Homo sapiens now scientists are questioning everything that is known about the time and location of the first people on earth is this finally the proof pre-adamite theorists have been looking for if Albert Perry's Y chromosome predates this by hundreds of thousands of years what are the implications is it possible there was an earlier human population that became extinct an incredible artifact that has been a topic of great controversy among historians and Scholars trying to get to the bottom of this mystery is a king's list found in the Sumerian uniforms the king lists go back 266,000 years now that's kind of interesting because modern scientists believe that the first humans like us came into existence less than 200,000 years ago and they believe that the first civilizations where you would have Kings and urban areas and social organiz they believe that all started 6 or 7,000 years ago so to have these Sumerian king lists going back 266,000 years is really amazing if humans had been around for close to 300,000 years according to Albert Perry's DNA test why do all these creation stories come from a much later time and even more odd why do we hold on to the truths that were given to us Us by these Gods researcher and historian Anton Parks has a disturbing theory about this you have to know that when the gods arrived on Earth according to what the tablet State they reigned over the Earth for thousands of years elements of the story are in the Zohar the nagadi text as well which basically tell the same story and the same version as the Sumerian one tens slave mankind human beings must behave not think too much and most of all not see that there is another reality to what is said in the text of Eden there is a curious scene it describes humans specially created to work in the garden but at some point in order to enforce their laws the gods place the humans in front of them behind the gods is their shiny Chariot that is how it is written and they make them pledge allegiance it is fascinating they impose their views upon mankind they want to scare them and sadly through this oath to which Humanity commits humans forbid themselves to ever be free I personally think that to this day we are still under the influence of this oath it is crucial to understand that in concrete terms we are still slaves we've never been free from the manipulation of beings on the outside side and that the sad irony in history is that humans have gotten down on their knees to things standing in front of them that had the name God and they were never Gods if the lifespan of our early Kings was 36,000 years it appears something in our Evolution changed 125,000 years ago in the Book of Genesis God said my spirit shall not strive with man forever because he also is flesh nevertheless his days shall be 120 years did human lives get shortened at some point the longest known human lifespan that modern scientists have on record a woman who died in the French Countryside in 1997 was 122 since then there has been significant debate about whether modern man has reached the upper limits of our longevity Methuselah in the scriptures lived a long time we have these stories did God intervene and change our DNA so now we only get 125 years or 150 years or some shorter period if so why would there be any way to find this to get this back or or is it working on some other level do we have longer or shorter lives in a spiritual sense in a psychological sense and an emotional sense has the rush of Modern Life shortened our Liv experience and there is some way to gain the enormity the expanse of time that we once knew Anton Park suggests that there is information that points to certain Bloodlines when you start looking at these subjects whether it is on the web or in some books that people qualify as possibly conspiracy books it often spoken of a genetic lineage reptilian and of Royal Blood I do think that some royal blood lines still exist nowadays that come from the anunas specifically the lineage of ano nerta and an could these descendants of royal bloodlines be able to see beyond the current reality in order to control it reporter Linda how has an interesting theory on the origins of the term blue blood one friend and colleague of mine was Lawrence Gardner he was tracking the whole significance of certain Bloodlines going back into Mesopotamia I was encountering exactly the same information coming in to my investigations of an alien presence on this planet and throughout the solar system we found that we met at sort of a same point and that was that in Mesopotamia that all of the anunaki were supposed to be reptilian and that The Reptilian biology had blood that was dominated by copper and that they literally had blue colored blood we have red because we have an iron dominant blood so our discussion from his history and my trying to get into it through aliens that have been dominating the Earth was that the blue blood reptilians of Mesopotamia led to a group called The mirians and the mirians tie later in the timeline directly to France Germany and that area of Europe because for some reason that bloodline the Blue Bloods went to Europe Lawrence Gardner and other people's work coming through royalty Blue Blood tie this connection between the reptilians mirians in Mesopotamia and they were literally a reptilian Blue Blood Line Anton Parks explains how his studies of several ancient texts reveal similar stories about humankind surrendering their will to Sumerian gods but that in the end we choose to kneel I think that we are still still under the influence of the oath sworn by Humanity in front of the gods and their Chariot at this particular Point Humanity forbade itself from ever knowing freedom and from thinking freely they more or less enslaved themselves we are still under the oath that the human race swore to the samian Gods in front of their spaceship I think that there are several ways of breaking this type of oath first of all by acknowledging it by allowing oneself and by saying it out loud I'm not anymore under the oath that was sworn to the anunas and this works for any oath from the moment when you know you have sworn an oath in this life or in a previous one you can actually liberate yourself quite simply sit and famously reinterpreted ancient Samaran text that he claimed told up extraterrestrials called anunaki or shining ones who came to Earth from a mysterious previously unknown Planet X hundreds of thousands of years ago their base of operations was Mesopotamia present day Iraq buried beneath the Sands of Iraq are the secrets of these shining ones and according to Bible prophecy the city of Babylon is destroyed near the end of the age this means it must be rebuilt Saddam Hussein spent over $500 million during the 1980s on the reconstruction and reestablishment of Babylon and fulfillment of that prophecy in 586 BC Nebuchadnezzar destroyed the Temple of Solomon in Jerusalem he looted its treasure including the Ark of the Covenant he also took 10,000 Jews from Jerusalem and held them captive in Babylon he needed the wise men of the Temple of Solomon to make a golden Gadget that opened a fiery furnace three of these wise men entered the fiery furnace and came back with the Son of God as in Jesus in tow suggesting that this was actually some kind of a portal I want to talk about what the Jews learned while they were in Babylon during their 70 years in Babylon between 586 BC and 5:116 BC the exiled Jewish people including the Ascension prophets Ezekiel and Daniel came into contact with the zoroastrians from Iran among other learned scholar and they learned many new doctrines from them Zoroastrianism was founded by zerra spaman of Central Asia he was the first messenger of the wise Supreme Being known as Aura Mazda the Greeks called him Zoro meaning shining Aster meaning star and foremost among his teachings is the idea of bodily resurrection and Ascension before their Exile in Babylon the Jews did not believe in heaven or hell or in the resurrection of the body or Soul they believed that once you died or were dead your soul goes to Sho meaning the prison house and that was the end of existence but while they were in Babylon the zoroastrians and the ancient Babylonians taught them about paradise and about a final Judgment of All Souls and about the resurrection into new bodies of light when the Jews arrived in Babylon they were greeted by the fabulous sight of the esagila the lofty house this zigurat was dedicated to the Mesopotamian God Marduk who was portrayed wearing a robe covered with stars he was a Celestial being also called the house that lifts its head high the esagila was his place of Ascension this great zigurat meaning Rising building or Temple Tower of Babylon was equivalent to the step pyramid or Stairway to Heaven and Sakara Egypt the description of marduk's SE second temple the edanan provided the Greek researcher Herodotus in his book The histories astonishing details about the temple ritual and its purpose the Temple of bell he said the Babylonian Zeus was still in existence in my time wrote Herodotus it has a solid central tower one Stadium square with a a second erected on top of it and then a third and so on up to eight all eight Towers can be climbed by a spiral way running round the outside and about halfway up there are seats for those who make the ascent to rest on on the summit of the topmost tower stands a great temple with a fine large couch in it richly covered and a golden table beside it the shrine contain contains no image and no one spends the night in there except one Babylonian woman all alone who however it may be that the God has chosen her for a specific reason the calans say though Herodotus didn't believe them that the god Muk himself enters the temple in person and takes his rest upon the bed what Herodotus had a hard time believing is the idea that Marduk a Celestial being a god manifests as a human in his Temple not only that but his intention is to to disrobe and lay with the human female of his choice the zigurat is a cosmic pole a ladder or a mountain that leads to heaven where the gods Marduk shamash adad and others dwell at the Throne of the supreme god whose name is Anu today we call such a place a Stargate this edaman Ascension Tower of ancient Babylon served as the backdrop for one of the greatest spiritual and literary revolutions the world has ever seen it began when the Jewish Mystics returned to Jerusalem during the 4th Century BC and came into contact with these teachings these teachings came into fruition at the time of Jesus who has shown ascending from a SP spiring Mountain that highly resembles the Bell Tower of Babylon we see Jesus entering the portal of the Sun and becoming one with all that is avatars such as abalonus of tyana a student of Pythagoras who was born into the same world as Jesus and whose miraculous Feats have been compared to him began to teach Ascension to the throne of God as a practical reality assuredly many more we have never heard of attempted this great feat one secret of boundary Crossing was that by reciting the stories of the Visionary ascents of past ascenders one could repeat the Visionary Ascent of the past ascenders Dr himar tells us that simply reading about the Ascension in these text is powerful in and of itself the stories are visualization and mind maps this is more than just a thought experiment as one thinks about it and visualizes or replicates their their Ascension in their mind one begins to live their Ascension in advance a whole body of Jewish and Christian literature called merkaba mysticism emerged at this time and comprises what may be thought of as flight simulation training manuals or boundary Crossing for the ascent of the Soul manuals manuals that teach us how to ascend to the Divine Throne traveling through the halls or holes of space on our Soul's winged ring one thing is clear these secrets appear to have originated with the Anunnaki and a lot of people don't know this because they've been distracted in a way by sit's theory that the UN came here not to teach us Ascension but in search of some mysterious blue stones and gold to repair the decaying atmosphere of their home planet and that they created humans as a slave race to do this work for them while sit's theory is not supported by the Samaran texts which say nothing about the Anunnaki coming to Earth for gold virtually all open-minded historical and Theological Scholars do agree that the the old testament's Book of Genesis was extracted from older Samaran records the stories of the Anunnaki for me the story of them the anunaki coming to Earth to mine gold just didn't add up it didn't make sense to me that these Advanced beings would come clear across the solar system just for gold and those mysterious blue stones I know that gold is a rare commodity in the universe but the unano are supposed to have been at least the level of technological advancement that we are today and we're less than a 100 years from warp drives all of Star Trek and nanofabrication but the unaki had to come here in rocket ships to create a slave race to mine gold didn't believe that what triggered my doubt was sitchin's assertion that enki The God Who retooled our DNA was also an alchemist an alchemist we know in ever to turn base medals into gold so why didn't enki simply grab a hunk of Space Rock and transmuted it's important to note that in sitchin's theory the pretext of the arrival of the Anunnaki was a cosmic cataclysm two planets one called Tiamat the other called an or Nibiru but referred to as Planet X collided leaving one of these planets shattered as a result of this confrontation Tiamat was was split in two one half of Tiamat became the asteroid belt the other half became Earth by splitting or dividing Tiamat in two this marauding planet released an ocean of blood into the cosmos but blood is lifeless without Soul so what if Tiamat also released Souls into the cosmos I made the the uh mistake of my lifetime more more than 30 years ago of writing this book The 12 Planet uh by the way uh we have made some posters uh replicating This original cover and I autographed them so they are available here H but before that I made another mistake much earlier uh when I was just a school boy fortunate and I am stressing the word fortunate to study the Bible some call it the Old Testament in its original Hebrew language and we reach chapter 6 of Genesis and uh it's the story about uh the events leading to the the flood the Deluge and I raised my hand and I asked the teacher why is the word uh in one of the first sentences of chapter six of Genesis why is it translated Giants there were giants upon the Earth uh in those days and uh there after too uh because the Hebrew word is Nephilim coming from the root naal which means to descend to come down in context from Heaven to Earth and I was expecting the teacher to compliment me and say siin very good very good you know your Hebrew and instead I was very harshly reprimanded for questioning the Bible but I was not questioning the Bible on the contrary I was trying to point out the need to uh understand exactly what it says so this became a obsession with me what what did the Bible mean by this word neim who were they why are they descri described by so many interpreters of the Bible as Giants and this led me eventually to mythology and then to the origins of Mythology the Sumerians and I ended up writing this book The 12 planet now when somebody mentions this book uh usually the comments are limited to well it's a book about duni who came from another planet called niru Etc but actually in the uh more than 350 pages of that book and more than 120 illustrations I did much more than just talk about uh another planet and the advanced beings who came from it I for example uh gave the date based on the Sumerian Tablets of when we not only how which is given in detail but when when we Homo sapiens were brought about and I said and people have their book the 12th Planet they can see that I said 300,000 years ago and uh Lord and behold on the way from New York where I live to Los Angeles now I opened the New York Times and there is a report there about a successful uh deciphering of the neander Gen know and uh in among other things it mentions there that it's now definitely established that homo sapiens suddenly appeared 300,000 years ago and I said that thank you and I said that uh uh back in the book when it was published 1976 uh I for example uh said that Mars was a was station the danti had a station a was station stayed on Mars and at that time Mars was deemed to be airless and waterless and totally uninhabitable and now of course we know differently so in many in many areas where I relied on the Sumerian Tablets on ancient knowledge but understanding it in light of our modern science so there's absolutely no conflict between science and Bible and those ancient suian tablets so back to the reason for this uh Gathering the 2012 problem now uh the first thing I'd like to remind uh the audience is that uh there have been other instances of uh Great Expectations good or bad uh about uh it's going to happen something is going to happen it was uh if you remember the Millennium the year 2000 was supposed to be the the predicted time and uh when people ask me then what will happen in 2000 I said uh after 2000 will come 2001 and that's basically what happened uh then there was for reasons that I cannot faom the whole excitement about 2003 and the planet that I discussed in my book uh sometimes the Fest Planet X the 10th Planet which which is the 12th member of the solar system uh so it's Planet X which means the 10th and the unknown and uh so in 2003 there was a whole expectation that this planet is on its way back and it's going to cause havoc and at that time I think it was not pagonia but Costa Rica that was the favored refuge and and nothing and nothing happened in in 2003 so now uh the excitement is about Planet X returning and doing whatever it will do in 2012 and uh this is related to so-called Mayan prophecies now I have uh devoted a lot of times and let affect one of my books uh the STS Deals Only with the Americas North America mes Amica and South America and I've studied as much as I could about the the Mayers and the As and and the Incas and so on and uh I have not come across anything that comes even close to Mayan profes there are a few codexes so called codexes which is like folded pages and they did no such predictions but I don't claim to know everything and some people do believe that something predictable or unpredictable uh will happen in 2012 and that is based on Mayan astronomy their astronomers were very sophisticated and that's what they predicted so he here are some on this slide some examples from Ian codexes of their astronomers at work uh these are three or four examples of Mayan astronomers looking or scanning the heavens and uh I don't think it looks too advanced at least to me now what they meso American peoples did have is a a calendar and as a matter of fact they had three calendars not just one one calendar which is known as The Long Count uh counted the passage of time this way and then there were two other calendars that were intermeshed in some way which I will explain and one was called the chin that counted the day the day byday passage of time and another one that counted it differently so there were three calendars uh in meso America but uh the main one which is called The Long Count was really not the Mayan calendar at all in meso America which is Mexico and Guatemala that's part of the new world uh there were actually three basic cultures or civilizations certainly when the spanian arrived one was uh centered more or less here which was called that one of the albeck the Mayers were here mostly in yukatan and the ash were here more in central Mexico now the old who were the oldest and are considered the mother civilization of meso America uh left behind and that's how uh people archaeologists came to know about them the Left Behind quite a number I think by now about 20 or so have been discovered colossal Stone heads carved to look presumably like they chiens and there's no doubt that they all look like people from Africa as a matter of effect when the first ones were discovered the Mexican archaeologist tried not to report it or to play down because it was quite embarrassing to them how come that the earli civilization of meso America before the atics and before the Mayers were black Africans but but this is the fact and now there are quite a number of museums uh especially one if you go to Mexico I recommend that you visit it it is in a town called halapa devoted exclusively to the alch civilization and uh among the exhibits curiously enough there are toys toys of all M children and as you can see some of them had Wheels uh while as you know uh every respected scholar and archaeologist will tell you that the will was totally unknown in the Americas so this was discovered in the Americas uh in Mexico another interesting Discovery was of this St which to me looks like an elephant and uh there are no elephants in the Americas so obviously the allm who made toys for their children uh remembered remembered what they remembered from wherever they came from Africa and in Africa there were a number of civilizations and the earliest one of the them was the Nile civilization later known as as Egypt but it was Nubia and other countries now uh I I must tell you that if you go to halapa you will neither see the whe toys and you will neither see this elephant toy because when I reported that on my website the uh people who read my books went there and uh these exhibits were removed for all kinds of excuses now the uh the Alx uh depicted uh the God who brought them over from Africa uh they called him U ketak quatle which me the winged the winged serpent some say the plum serpent I prefer the wing and that's how he looked this is not a carving by sit this is an all carving and uh you can see that this is somebody definitely bearded and one feature distinguishing people in mes America is that they don't have facial hair so this again is someone not not from mes America not from the Americas at all uh that's how he looked now uh the question arose in [Music] time when when did the alxs LED or helped come over by this deity when did they come to mes America uh so as part of the embarrassment of admitting that Africans were there before you know the Hispanics or the atics uh so the the notion was well maybe around the 200 ad and then it was maybe 200 BC and then maybe 500 BC but all the evidence pointed out to 3,000 BC 3,000 almost 5,000 years ago which raised of course other questions how could people from Africa travel across the Atlantic so long so that was not a welcome finding the first time I was there with the with the group The traveled with me uh in halapa uh as you enter the museum there's one of those colossal heads and then there's a wall a wall depicting the various civilizations of Mexico of the Americas and when they started and as we go down the steps and I neared this world with its depictions I was really startled to see and I'm pointing out at it that it says all make civilization 3,000 BC and I said well you know finally somebody admits it uh so that part of the wall is also G by [Music] now and as I mentioned I uh discussed some of these things and more of them in the book devoted entirely to the Americas the losts now back to the issue of 2012 in the calendar so the key calendar uh that really gives a time from now the those who studyed and and who decipher the the the script uh say that it's not 3,000 BC but it's exactly 3,13 3113 BC they even say the day one day one of this calendar was someday equivalent to to somay in August August 3,13 BC and the way this calendar works is that there are signs they can call them hieroglyphs or icons whatever and one kind of sign is the number of days just days uh which are given here and then the other sign gives the number of another unit of days given here and then a third one given here and finally it ends up on some of those man monuments with a unit of time called bakon bakon which is equal to 144,000 days so adding up uh so many bons would add up to so many days and this sign so many days and totaling them all and you divide as it's done here into the number of days in a year at 365 in a quarter and so you arrive at the number of days when this Monument was set up up and dated they said this Monument was set up and dated so many days since day one that the way we count it so if you divide it by the number of years and deduct 3,113 you arrive at that the 13th bakun will end will reach its culmination in 2012 so this is the basis of all the 2012 predictions already when I was studying the material for my book The Lost Realms I found that way back in the previous Century not the 23st but previous to the 20th in the 19th century it was observed that while it is true that we count 365 and a quarter days of the year this calendar as you can see or maybe it's not so easy to see it but anyway it is using the number 360 as the base of multiples 360 so some have already said more than 100 years ago that the real way to understand this calendar is not to divide the number of days by 365 in a quarter but by the way this calendar was constructed 360 now if you divide the number of days by 360 you get more years and according to that the 13th bakon will end or reach its culmination only in 20087 BC not in 2012 so it's a matter of choice uh which way to divide the number of days and if it's done the way that some believe and I do too then you arrive at 287 uh which means that uh if if you accept uh this way of calculating you have uh what some 70 or 75 years uh before you go to Patagonia there's another another problem with this notion that things will come to an end to a culmination to to a catastrophe to whatever when the 13th bakon will culminate and the problem is that that calendar did not stop using bons as the final unit after bakun he had a unit called pikun which was a bakun which is based on 360 time 20 and here is another listing that shows that after the bakon there were units on The Monuments who covered a pikon so uh there's really uh with all due respect to all others and everybody is entitled to their opinion and their understanding of events or evidence uh that there is nothing in my humble opinion to indicate that the Mayan predictions if any culminate with the 13th bakon because then we'll start a Pon so uh this leaves us with the problem of uh what indeed if anything the the Mayas or the astics what did they say or indicate so now we have to fall back to the other two calendars uh which uh contain more interesting Clues than when the all Mak arrived in in mes America the other two you recall are called the chin and the Hub now nobody knows really the origin of those terms uh neither do I know what suin means except that it's a count of days but the Hub interested me because that was an epte or another nickname for the god the Egyptian God who was called to in Egypt and one of his epat was H and here is a page from a textbook about to in Egypt and the various hieroglyphic names in which his name was written and one of them was definitely Hub so this raises an interesting uh intriguing possibility that maybe the God that was renamed qual quat in me America maybe it was really the Egyptian god to and indeed according to Egyptian records which I discuss at length in other books uh to was forced by his half brother rival the godra in Egypt he was forced to leave Egypt around 3,000 100 BC and if one wants to be precise perhaps on that date 3, 113 BC when the Long Long Count calendar again so if this isn't indeed a clue there's another interesting thing and that is in Egypt uh the number 52 was considered to be the secret number of thought that it is the number of weeks 7even day weeks in the year is not a coincidence but uh I won't spend time on that but this secret number uh was 5 too and these two other calendars the soin and the H uh that mesh together and turn around come back to the same spot once every 52 years as if they were designed or in some other way connected with this God to what the May called kulan which means the same thing the plumed or the wing serpent now this thing this 52 years cycle which is called the bundle the Mayers called it the bundle uh played the role in in the history of meso America because this God K Alo uh who gave the civilization the Al and the others in mes America left he definitely the record say that he left but before he left he said I will be back I will be back precisely on the th day of the bundle when the Cycles completes 52 years he just didn't say after how many cycles so in 1519 in 1519 ad uh the atic king Mona a got word that a bearded God a white bearded God the way I showed you depicted has returned and 1519 ad as we counted was exactly the day a bundle a bundle year so Mont made a mistake of assuming that the God has returned took all the precious objects including a golden calendar because this was the God's creation and presented it to him and that was uh the beginning of the end of the asex and the conquest of America by the Spaniards by The Conquistadors uh now I found in in many in one of my many trips to to Mexico and going to smaller and Regional museums I found this depiction on a monument a Mayan Monument by the way showing a Mayan Chien uh lying prostrate or whatever this position means uh hearing or being told goodbye I don't know what but this sign this sign in Mayan hieroglyphics means speaking this plumed God the wing the wing god is saying to the Mayan Chi let's say uh something that has to do with 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 planets so one can say without any certainty Beyond speculation that this God the plumed serpent says to the Mayan you know arid I'm going back to the 10th Planet but I'll be back and this I think is a a very impressive and and crucial piece of evidence now uh so who who who were not just was kakat Oran but who were in general the the the May the as the gods now if you go to various places in in Mexico in Guatemala you see these depictions in temples you see this depiction of one of the dies did is again bearded and certainly not Mesoamerican and I show comparisons to objects and depictions found not necessarily in Egypt but further east in Mesopotamia you see the comparison here you see the comparison here uh if you look at the famous Mexican pyramids uh which are step pyramids they are not smooth sided like the Egyptian pyramids they are more similar or entirely similar to the suian and and later Babylonian Irish temples called zigurat which again were step pyramids so the connection as I have concluded leads not just to Egypt but to what was before Egypt to a civilization that preceded by almost a th years uh 800 years at least of the Egyptian civilization that one of mamia so this is the map of the near East this is Egypt this is the sin Peninsula this is the Middle East this is what is now Iraq ancient Mesopotamia and and there about 4,000 at 4,000 BC some 6,000 years ago uh there emerged uh suddenly this is the term used by others suddenly unexpectedly almost out of nowhere Etc a high Civilization now not only that that I devoted most of the book The 12 planet to it and subsequent books but uh I I once said that if if I were awakened from my sleep and somebody say would hold a gun to me and say talk about the Sumerians I I Will Survive because I I can talk for hours in days about the Sumerians but this is not the for it so I will just mention that in addition to all the first that are attributed to the Sumerians the first this and the first that etc etc uh without doubt one of their most outstanding legacies is the introduction of writing and this is an example of sarian writing called uniform because it was done with the stylus of on on a tablet clay tablet that was still wet and then it dried sometimes was dried in the Kil to become more permanent and this is the origin of writing without which I couldn't write my books so the other was the cylinder seal uh in a way that nobody has yet figured out out uh there artist could take a stone as often as not semi precious make a cylinder out of it carving it in reverse as a negative the image or the writing or whatever they wanted to depict and when this was rolled on wet clay like a rotary press the positive image uh wasin was embedded on the wet clay and again became permanent now how they did it to this day nobody has figured out but this is one way in which we have not only text from Antiquity due to the writing but also the way we have victorial evidence from Antiquity and unlike the the the Mayas and their primitive astronomy uh one of the Sumerian achievements was a very sophisticated astronomy uh they described the planets that we have discovered only in the past 200 years or so after the introduction of the telescope uh they depicted not not not only not only listed those planets but they describe them and in my book the 12th Planet I give Sumerian descriptions of the planets the our spacecraft the P Spa spacecraft visited only the in few few decades ago and I said according to the Sumerians Neptune looks this way Uranus looks that way they explained the odd orbit of Pluto and so on and one of the cylinder seals that I have come upon looking at uh seals or their imprints of of thousands and thousands of them was this one which has since been visited and looked at by by thousands of people in the mum in Berlin it is known as cylinder seal va24 the tree uh it's supposedly a a mythological depiction of a God because the gods are amid they never existed granting the plow to Mankind and uh as many other seals the God is named by the way uh there were ornaments of celestial objects and when I looked at this one I said this looks to me like a solar system and this is what is the without the arrow this is what is depicted on that cylinder seal up here and uh this first of all shows the a star the sun and not the Earth in the center as the Ancients were supposed ignorantly to believe that the Earth is the center of the universe so this is a star the sun is surrounded by planets and if you compare this depiction of the way we would depict planets orbiting our sun you see that the location and the sizes are match each other uh with one great exception that uh between Mars and Jupiter Mars and Jupiter uh the subaran depicted one more relatively large planet that uh of whose existence we are not really but we are supposed not to know uh and this count by the way this count of uh 10 10 objects uh circling or orbiting the Sun uh plus the moon making a total of 12 hence the title of my first book the 12th Planet it should really have been the the 10th Planet which is the 12th member of the solar system so when the publisher considered publishing my first book he says to me forget it it's too long it's the 12th Planet so so so it's the 10 the 10th Planet which is the called the 12th Planet so here on many mon monuments and I showed only one example is again all those uh the Sun the moon uh all the other planets plus this one which is sometimes depicted by a wing dis uh this mysterious planet now did such a planet exist was it really uh affect affect at least in Antiquity and uh the Sumerians dedicated to to writing as they were indeed Left Behind uh tals on clay tablets and one of them is called the Epic of creation which tells the story of how that one more planet uh happened to join the solar system and the Epic of creation describes the systematic or step by step uh coming into being of the planets around the Sun I said there was an Olden planet called Tiamat and then there were two two planets that came into being between Tiamat and the sun which we now call Mercury and and Venus and then other planets came into being always like like two two at the time and into that solar system at some point uh an upheaval took place because a a planet that belonged to another solar system and was somehow Thrust out of it was pass passing by our solar system and the gravitational pool of those planets that did exist in the solar system started to attract it and change its course from this way this is all the diagram of course this way more inwards inwards and finally into a collision with this Olden planet theat and the collision had to occur because while all the planets in the solar system that coal science modern science believes out of a a cloud of dust orbit in This One Direction counterclockwise but this Invader this stranger came and it is orbiting clockwise so the Collision was really unavoidable the text referred to it as a Celestial battle I the dealing in the book the 12th Planet and then in another book titled Genesis visited step by step and explain scientifically what the what ancient words mean but there were then a series of collisions uh this planet in whom the Babylons Babylonians renamed Marduk in honor of their National God uh had developed moons or satellites Tiamat also had a host led by a large Moon called kingu there was a series of collisions and finally in the final Collision uh Tiamat was uh split in two one part was totally smashed to bits of pieces and became a uh an orbiting band which we call the asteroid belt and by the way the Sumerian explanation of the origin of the asteroid belt is the only available explanation because modern science has no explanation for it and the other half more or less intact but only half a planet was shunted to a new orbit plus the largest moon of theat and became our planet Earth and became the planet Earth and if you uh look at the at at the way our planet really looks you see that uh uh there is this huge cavity which we call the the Pacific Ocean and the continents have uh have spread out and from half half a planet we have now a round Planet partly rounded by water okay we are back in business I hope uh all right so the question is once uh that Collision taken place the Earth was created with its moon what happened to the The Invader according to all those text The Invader became a permanent member of our solar system with a great elliptical orbit coming back to our vicinity once every 3600 years give or take and that is the so this is how uh according to the Sumerian epic of creation uh the planet socaled Planet X the 10th Planet the 12th Planet the Sumerians called it Nibiru which meant planet of the crossing at when it reaches the uh proximity of Earth and reaches the its point of Pary the closest to the Sun they called it the crossing and indeed uh uh very often when uh it neared it when it neared the Earth uh the U symbol for that planet changed from a wing disc to a cross and on some of the uh slides that there were was going to show to you uh around 1,000 BC the symbol of the Cross began to appear replacing the uh a symbol of the wing disc and the reason was that uh that planet niru was nearing Earth and the time the moment of Crossing was nearing was expected I had all slew of slides to show you uh with ancient evidence with quotes even from the Bible from various prophets Isaiah Amos and others that start Ed around that time 800 BC 750 BC to speak about the nearing day of the Lord reference was to a Celestial Lord a planet a planet considered a God by the Babylonians uh and the as time went on 800 BC 750 BC 700 6:15 I had the whole sequence for you quoting this prophet and that prophet in the Bible the The Talk The prophecies about the coming the coming day of the Lord became more and more imminent uh it's coming it will show up from the south it'll the disguise will darken when it appears uh there'll be some other he and so on uh similarly there were the same kind of predictions and I Illustrated them both with the text and with diagrams uh in in the Babylonian and Assyrian uh tablets and other depictions there were actually uh records of astronomical observations from that time saying the planet is nearing the planet is appearing the planet is inen redish glowing etc etc etc and finally the day of the Lord uh took place uh it took place exactly in 556 BC and uh it is remembered uh in ancient records as uh an unusual an unexpected solar eclipse a total solar eclipse and the shadow passed precisely over a certain place called haran which played played an important role in those events um again I regret it I I cannot show you the evidence for it but uh it's all in my book it's all in my book The Lost book book of thans all in the book the end of days so you you can read about it to some extent although not not not all the victorial evidence is there so what it it amounts to is uh the biblical prophecies that are usually taken as as as one body of Prophecy this and this will happen uh were actually separated by me literally the way I challenged the teacher uh when I was a school boy about the precise meaning of a word in the Bible that if you follow the biblical prophecies precisely what does it say and what does it mean you see that it was split and divided into two separate phenomena one was the day of the Lord which was the return the return of the planet which I suggest did take place in 556 BC now if the orbit of the planet is roughly and I explain in the book uh the end of days why it's roughly if it's roughly 3600 100 years so the next nearing of the planet if you deduct 556 from about 3600 you're talking about the 29th Century uh ad so if those who uh are afraid or or or or create great concerns about uh the Mayan calendar and the year 2012 which as I explained before is iffy even if you accept the Mayan and the mes American calendars maybe it's the 2087 ad not 2012 then if they are linked as most of them are to the return of the planet niru Planet X the planet of the Gods the planet of anunaki if that is what is intimated then it is baseless the planet will not return in this Century neither in 2012 nor in 2087 but there are those prophecies there is the pro promise of wle who said I will be back so what we should expect uh ladies and gentlemen is not the imminent Return of the planet we should expect the return of the Gods of the anunaki as the Sumerians called them and therefore the question is first of all if because not everybody has to accept the biblical prophecies as as is valid not everybody does but if we accept the biblical prophecies as our guides and uh if we compare the biblical prophecies with past events and everything that was prophesied by Jeremiah by Isaiah by Ezekiel Etc about their days did take place so I I am inclined to accept the veracity of the Bible also in this respect and say that uh there will be a return of the Gods the question is then when now this is not a new question because uh the last book apart from the Chronicles the last book in the in the Bible in the Old Testament is the Book of Daniel and it deals with this very same question Daniel has spent his days and his encounters with with Angelic beings Etc by keeping asking them when when when and uh he got various answers and most of them or all of them very enigmatic and and to the last day uh the last page of the Book of Daniel it's still a question he he didn't know and it ends up with saying you know the Enigma the mystery is still there but the clearest the clearest answer of several that he got was that uh the end of days we left behind the day of the Lord and we are now dealing with the end of days which is how I started discussing the this Mayan calendar business at the end of days will care Daniel was told after time times and a half uh which they didn't doing much good because he didn't understand what it means which time what time what does time times and a half mean Etc now one of those that spent most of his time and most of his life I could say uh trying to decipher this Enigma when will the end of days take place whether this signifies the return of the gods or some other cataclysmic or or other events was uh Sir Isaac Newton he's mostly known for his calculations of orbits Etc uh but he left behind pages and volumes and volumes of handwritten manuscripts dealing with this issue what does time times and times and half me and it so happened that uh about two years ago uh this whole collection of Sir Isaac Newton manuscripts uh ended up in Jerusalem at one of the libraries there donated by some benefactor who who bought the the whole collection of of Newton manuscripts and that included a page one page written on both sides in ink this way and this way where his final calculations were given and I found out about it because the BBC the British Broadcasting Corporation in a program uh about Sir Isaac Newton on some anniversary I don't recall which his birth his death 200 years or 250 years uh mention at the very end that uh before he died ISAC Newton calculated the end of days to take place in 2,100 160 ad pretty soon so I uh succeeded in tracking down at that page uh which was given a fa name ZX or whatever of it of both sides and uh as I studied it the front and the back I I realized what what he was after uh 2,160 sounded to me like a familiar figure and among the slides that you will not see this evening were several dealing with with the Zodiac uh one of the invention or first with which the Sumerians are credited but they really got it from the anunaki is zodiacal time uh you can imagine that when the anunaki coming from a planet where one year equals 3,600 of hours because what is a year one orbit around the sun uh they come from their planet and L this planet and and say what kind of a crazy place it is you know it runs like crazy around the Sun you know before before it Sunrise it's already Sunset so uh uh so they needed they needed I have suggested some kind of a median some kind of a way to coordinate the the time that Earth moves around around the sun with the time that their Planet moves around the sun and it so happens that due to a phenomenon called procession which which is the name for the phenomenon that as the earth goes around the Sun after a year 365 and a quarter and all that business days it does not it does not come back to precisely the spot from which it started there is a slight retardation the retardation accumulates amounts to one degree of 360 in 72 years and therefore if the anunaki created a zodiac of 12 constellations in Antiquity they were called houses or stations uh so each 12th was 30\u00b0 so 30 * 72 is 200 2,160 and when I saw that page by Sir Isaac Newton I said that's what he was after he was calculating zodiacal time that was the time the anunaki devised to mesh like those two wheels between their planet and our planet and it Orit around the Sun uh so this this Zod time so the key the key to answering the question if they will return as I believe they will if they will return and the question then is when which is like asking when is the end of days according to the Book of Daniel Etc that what he was told time time our time so that IAL time not your time our time one sodal period two sodal or whatever so I was included uh several slides that show you that there are all kinds of indications uh which I interpreted and I believe indicate that the end of days and the return will take place during the zodiacal age of Isis this is our age until the end of this Century so whether you say the Mayan calendar calculated one way is 2087 if you say when is the meshing what they call the bundle every 52 years if you add 52 years to ad 1519 when when uh uh CES landed no you had you had you you arrive at the next one at 297 ad if you take the zodiacal ages you arrive at the latest 2100 ad uh so this I suggest is when the end of days will OCC thank you "
