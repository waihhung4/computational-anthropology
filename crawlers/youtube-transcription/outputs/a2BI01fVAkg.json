"greetings everyone around the world laa Montgomery here once again with another China History Podcast episode we're going to explore the Shang Dynasty today if the Shia Dynasty which we discussed in the last episode was a legendary Dynasty then we can call the Shang a semi- legendary Dynasty that we know for sure existed let me just mention first this is a re-recording of an old episode from 2010 I know from so many years of emails that a lot of you start at the beginning of the CHP back catalog and listen to the earliest episodes first well I'm going to admit way back then the CHP was meant to be a much shorter show that didn't delve too deeply into the subjects presented and then sometime around 2014 or 2015 the show began to go through a transformation including better sound recording so this is a re-recording all edited and enhanced there's a lot more to fix up in these early shows and I'll get to everything in time anyway the Shia and the Shang have a lot in common they both have legendary Beginnings that start with a virtuous and great leader who is beloved by the people then you have the succession and then a lot of blank spots and then in the end you have a wicked Tyrant who was hated by the people and was ultimately overthrown and as I mentioned at the end of last episode there was usually some black-hearted woman standing behind facilitating an ignoble end of the dynasty I'm jumping way ahead but just trying to show you how both dynasties had similar Rises and Falls unlike the Shia which made a slow and steady March down hill the Shang had a great Revival two-thirds of the way into the Dynasty and it's really the last couple centuries of the Shang that are the most important the Shang definitely has a lot more to hang on to than the Shia even to this day the best historiographers archaeologists and scientists China has to offer are still analyzing the Treasure Trove of Shan artifacts that continue to be Unearthed even to this day already 11 palaces have been discovered in and around anang in Hunan Province believe it or not it was only in the 20th century that we learned this dynasty actually existed San wrote All about the Shang in his sh G or records of the grand historian so it's not like we never heard of the Shang before in his great work simaan spoke at length about the Shang period And even enumerated all the Shang Kings in a single list and more about that later like the preceding sha Dynasty the start and finish dates of the Shang are open to debate in 1996 six the China government launched the xia Shang Jo D Chang or a chronology report on the xia Shang Joe to set down a more accurate timestamping for these first three Bronze Age dynasties in November 2000 the results were announced and they pegged the Sha at 270 to 1600 BC and the Shang was split up from 1600 to 1300 BC for the early Shang and 1300 to 1046 BC for the late Shang the Shang Dynasty ran during the middle of China's Bronze Age in other far away lands at this time Egypt was already a mighty Empire it was the period of the great 18th Dynasty the most famous and ancient Egyptian history China's Shang dynasty was concurrent with many of the most famous pharaohs like tutan common and the toot Moses hatchepsut akatan and Nefertiti the New Kingdom in Egypt was just starting the Shang period in China was also concurrent with the time when Moses of the Old Testament was born in Egypt in 1612 BC this means it was also the time of ramsy the first and second this was just as the Sha was dying and the Shang was starting to rise Biblical times over on the opposite end of Asia elsewhere in the world the temple at Deli was built in Greece Myan and minoan culture was flourishing 1149 BC would have been the time of the Trojan War so as Chinese civilization was just starting to take shape and organize and consolidate all these other civilizations were thriving and developing on separate continents all independent of each other even in China there was more civilization going on than simply the Shang but it was only the Shang Dynasty that left behind written records of their existence in 1987 there was an exciting archaeological Discovery in suan near chungu the place was called saning or three stars Mound you could hear more about San Shing D from the CHP episode 276 lots of artifacts were excavated like beautiful Jades and bronzes attesting to a rather Advanced people but one thing they didn't leave behind was any written record of their history unlike the Shang peoples developing up around Kanan Hub Shandong and Northern Anu this civilization down in the chungu region had not yet developed a writing system so be sure to check out the later CHP episode on S gin sha and ancient Shu CHP episode 276 let's go with 1600 BC as the start of the Shang Dynasty like the Shia Dynasty founder you the great the Shang also had a heroic founder he came to be known as Chong Tang he was named z his ancestor had helped you the great tame the yellow river floods way back when his family was given the land of Shang as a reward and as San wrote after you tamame the floods he had nine cauldrons cast in the style of a ding a three-legged ritual bronze vessel that's one of the icons of China's Bronze Age dynasties nine of these dings one for each of the nine provinces these were sacred objects and contain the symbolic authority to rule well after Chong Tong defeated King J and put an end to the Shia he took possession of these nine cauldrons or Jing and wherever the Shang Capital was moved to the sacred nine cauldrons went to they ended up getting lost during the chaos of the Waring States period but the nine cauldrons are an important part of this earliest time now the time of Chong Tong was already 14 Generations later and by this time the Shang was already a rather powerful state in its own rights as I mentioned in the last episode CH Tang defeated the wicked and evil King J at the Battle of Mingo Chun Tang founded the Shang Dynasty and a drought struck almost immediately after about seven years of suffering this drought King Tong went before heaven and prostrated himself on the altar presumably at some high Temple and reproached himself before heaven and offered to present himself as a sacrifice to to shangti if he would only bring rain to end the drought stricken land well as the legend goes it started to rain soon thereafter and the farmers rejoiced in Chong Tong's reputation and esteem as a ruler and a hero skyrocketed so you the great who founded the Shia Dynasty he tamed the floods Chong Tong who founded the Shang he was able to get the Heavens to rain down upon the Land There are similar stor I'm sure of other benevolent rulers and all the cultures around the world who also were associated with miraculous life-saving events the capital of the new Shang government was in present day jungo capital of Hunan Province the capital of the Shang Dynasty moved around a lot about five times and if you form a triangle between the cities of changjo anang and laang that covers the area where most of the Shang palaces and major cities have been excavated it was after the seventh and final move to the capital at Yin in the 13th century BC when the Shang Dynasty reached its apex at the capital of Yin present day anang Hunan Province 12 Kings ruled over 255 years until the Shang period came to an end and was replaced by the Joe Dynasty as I said the Shang worshiped the god Shanti in Mandarin the word for God is Shanti Shang means above and D is the Emperor so this deity was above the emperor and the emperor through the ruler special relationship with all the ancestors held particular closeness with Shang D however Shang D the Shang Supreme deity was the main God among several the shung religion was not monotheistic by any stretch of the imagination they were also very big on sacrificing animals they also believed in ancestral worship and the afterlife and for the Royals at least took tomb building and burial in general very seriously before we go through various vignettes from this dynastic period let's zero in on the four contributions to Chinese civilization that we can say came from the Shang per perod these are the aspects of the Shang that really Define the Dynasty and what we most remember them for first and foremost writing is seen for the first time in Chinese history more about this later the second was the social organization of the country into a very stratified system where everybody had a place and The Aristocrats and royal family stood at the Apex of Shang Society all these nobles were beholden to to the king and they controlled the outlying areas too far from the capital and the King's everyday control the priests had a dual role in Shang Society not only were they entrusted with the job of Performing all rituals and religious matters they were also the bureaucrats of the kingdom and handled all the day-to-day Affairs of the government the third aspect that we can say defines the Shang is their Mastery of bronze casting and their bronze making technolog iCal standard a lot of Shang era artifacts survive to this day in museums and private collections around the world another specialty of the Shang was their use of bronze and the manufacturer of effective weaponry and this included everything from spares to chariots in those days bronze meant power wealth and luxury it was only for those who lived at the Imperial Court or the aristocrats who had Bronze in their daily life bronze wasn't anything that the peasants possessed or came in contact with all these bronze objects were basically either one of two things bronze was used to make weapons or ceremonial vessels never for common tools I'm sure everyone knows this but just in case bronze is a metal alloy made up of mostly copper with tin or a number of other metals you can imagine how much of this stuff has been dug up over the last century in the final years of the Shang especially during the yin Shang period important events and records were inscribed or cast in the bronze ceremonial objects the Shang people because of their Superior bronze making technology were able to make more effective weapons like Spears compound bows and better horsedrawn chariots and this made them the conquerors to beat of their time Z Maan wrote in the records of the grand historian the sh G that there were a total of 30 Shang rulers covering roughly 600 years Court officials belong to a hereditary class of aristocrats the core of the dynasty was located in the northern part of Hunan and the crops of those days were Millet wheat and barley the Shang used the lunar calendar or Yi to date all the events of their time believe it or not the same lunar calendar was used in China all the way up to the last century they also developed a 12-month calendar with 365 and a quar days and the great civilizations developing around the world yeah pretty much all figured that one out on their own can you imagine though being the first person four 5,000 maybe 6,000 years ago actually keeping track over the period of 365 days and being the first to understand the concept of a single year in addition to this the Shang also developed the decimal system and had already begun to develop sophistication with math and science well let's get right to the whole bangers and mash here as far as the Shang is concerned if he could say anything about these ancient Chinese who developed during the Shang period they were the people who gave us Chinese characters the legend has it that Chinese characters were invented during the time of the yellow Emperor around 2650 BC by one of his officials Tangier he's the legendary creator of Chinese writing but Tangier didn't leave any evidence of his creation the Chinese of the Shang Dynasty however they did the great story behind the discovery of the earliest Chinese characters is something right out of the last year of the 19th century now I covered this subject in more detail in a standalone episode on the Shang Oracle bones but this incredible concatenation of events began in 1899 in and around the city of anong in Hunan Province all of a sudden in a short period of time these so-called longu started showing up long means dragon and Goo Means bone and these dragon bones were being dug up all over anang and the environs around the Juan River some of these dragon bones ended up in the hands of private Chinese antique collectors who were fascinated with the archaic looking characters carved into the bones some of the bones ended up with practitioners of Chinese medicine who ground them up into powders mix them into compounds that were administered as Chinese medicine used to cure a variety of ailments among them was malaria and these medicines derived from dragon bones were contained in all the Materia Meda going back to shanong Bing one day in 1899 the director of the Imperial College Dr Wang Rong was seeking relief from malaria and he was given some of these dragon bones from a local Apothecary he was given a prescription that instructed how to grind the dragon bones up and how to consume them and Dr Wong's trained eye noticed all the inscriptions on these dragon bones now up until this moment in our recent history the Shang Dynasty was about as legendary as the Sha there were a lot of stories and legends and we had some aan account of that period a lot of smoke but never any fire well wangong was able to trace these dragon bones to a village called Shaun outside of the city of anang by 1917 the noted scholar philologist and literatus Wang guwe had deciphered the bone inscriptions including the names of the Shang Kings and if only simen had lived to see that day because when the inscriptions concerning that chronological listing of all the Shang Dynasty kings were figured out and they placed the results side by side with what suin had written in his sh G they matched perfectly well once these discoveries were made and archaeologists figured out roughly where the Shan kingdom was situated they started pulling one treasure after another out of the ground tomb after tomb bronze Masterpiece after bronze Masterpiece and hundreds of thousands of shells and Bones all inscribed with ancient Chinese characters and through Decades of studying that goes on into our very day the whole story of the Shang Dynasty and Shang Society slowly revealed itself and from this time onward the Shang was no longer a legendary Dynasty from 1928 until the Japanese invaded China in 1937 they started Excavating yinu the name archaeologists had given for this site this is where they discovered the Royal Palace Royal tombs and a veritable Treasure Trove of these dragon bones that soon thereafter started to be called Oracle bones this script that's inscribed in these Oracle bones is called the jaku Oracle bone script Oracle bones made predictions about the future for the most part these were the scapula or shoulder blades of a water buffalo or some kind of cattle the second most prevalent method was using the shells of tortoises the way it worked these early characters would be carved into the bones or the shells in the form of questions and on the opposite side a number of small pits or holes were carved and then into these little cracks or pits that they carved into the bones or shells they inserted these thin white hot metal rods and this heated metal would in turn cause the bones or shells to crack and then the priests would interpret or Divine these cracks and interpret them and thus the question was answered then the answer to the question was also carved into the same bone or shell and taking it one step further the actual outcome would also be carved by one scribe or another and it was through studying these artifacts and there were over a couple hundred thousand to look at that the scient ific Community there had been able to piece together the story of the Shang one after another names of Kings were confirmed the style of government was revealed battles from military history as well as religious beliefs were discovered and in time a fairly good understanding of shang's society was learned and it was also from these bones that it was found that the Shang were constantly at war with Outsiders from near and far you see the eight or nine Generations after Chong Tong founded the dynasty the Shang Royal Court had deteriorated into a NeverEnding battle between brothers and other relatives always fighting for power at the top resources were wasted building palaces and pleasure domes where Nobles lived in splendor and luxury it was only when the 19th Shang King panang came to the throne that the Shang had a Revival and reached its apex under King Wu panang who ruled from 1290 to 1263 BC was the ruler who moved the Shang Capital to Yin present day anang it wasn't a terribly popular move and no one common people included wanted to leave their comfortable surroundings and start all over somewhere else nonetheless that's what ended up happening and pan Gung is credited as the founder of the yin Dynasty or Yin Shang period and for Reviving the sinking ship that the Shang had become he's mentioned in both the bamboo annals and the records of the grand historian the two most important surviving texts that cover these most ancient centuries of China's history now I mentioned yinu a little bit ago the last part of the Shang Dynasty as I mentioned was where the dynasty reached its height of power and sophistication the capital was located in the city of Yin in Northern Hunan close to the borders of shanii and H Shu means ruins so yinu means the ruins of Yin and from this point on the Dynasty is called the yin Shang or sometimes just the yin Dynasty from the capital at Yin 12 Kings ruled for another 255 years years all of these artifacts being pulled from the ground came from the yin period or somewhere near the beginning of the 14th century BC now the Shang is in its golden age one of the best preserved sites at yinu is the tomb of FAL or lady Hall lady Hall was the wife of King Wu ding where the yin Shang reached its greatest Heights lady Hall was not only the wife of the king she was a great military leader in her own right and led successful campaigns against some of the Shang enemies her tomb was discovered in the tumultuous year in China of 1976 in the winter of 1976 a few months after the death of chairman Mo the fuul moo was discovered moo means tomb in this case so the fuul tomb was discovered now like King tne Egypt fuh House's tomb had been discovered undisturbed so for almost 28 centuries the tomb's hidden location had eluded grave robbers it was open to the public as an exhibit in 1999 in the yinu museum in anang it's definitely on my list of places to go the Bronze Age Queen Fu House's tomb had been dated to about 1200 BC and it was positively identified as Fu's tomb by by all the bronze inscriptions or ginin as these bronze inscriptions were called buried with this great Queen and military leader were all kinds of Jade and carved bone objects things like Arro heads hair pins and other ornamental objects there was a massive catch of bronze artifacts like weapons Bells knives mirrors statues of animals real and mythical they also uncovered Stone objects art made from Ivory and even 6,900 pieces of cowry shells the currency of its day found in the burial chamber of Queen fuha were the skeletal remains of six dogs and 16 humans presumably slaves it was already known at the time that the Shang period saw a degree of human sacrifices the Oracle bones uncovered at the site revealed that FAL was the greatest military leader of her time as I said she was the wife of the 21st Shang King Wu ding he led the yin Shang Dynasty at its peak and as I said again the yin period of the Shang was the high point of the entire Shang Dynasty the Dynasty's fortunes will degrade from here on out and the 58-year reign of Wu ding is remembered as the Shang Dynasty's finest hour before we finish up the Shang and the evil and wicked last king let's look at Shang writing Chinese characters first appear during this dynasty in both Oracle bones and in these bronze ritual vessels if anything was committed to paper or some other organic substrate they've long disappeared there's been anywhere from 3 to 5,000 characters that have been cataloged from all the findings by archaeologists having this ability to communicate and record information in writing gave the Shang rulers a very enhanced ability to rule it really allowed the central authority to spread its wings out a little wider and directly control farther areas of the Kingdom anyways the amazing thing about this early Shang writing is that written Chinese today basically uses the same system they came up with over 2000 thousand years ago the system of writing that uses a radical to give the character a general meaning or classification joined together with a phonetic symbol of some sort to indicate a sound is still used today and the amazing thing about Chinese characters ancient and modern is that they're similar to Arabic numerals and that no matter how you pronounce them the meaning is always the same so Chinese writing first starts pairing between 1500 to 1200 BC writing was already in use for about a thousand years in the indis river valley civilization and for almost a thousand years before that by the Egyptians it was the Mesopotamian civilizations that were the earliest writing appeared in ancient Sumer as early as 3200 BC a good 2,000 years before the Shang Oracle bones well all good things have to come to an end and indeed it came to a smashing and a violent conclusion for the Shang like the Shia before them this dynasty also suffered from a tyrant who was Remembered in infamy the Sha had King J the Shang had King Joe also known as D Shin other than being credited as the creator of Chopsticks this King join went down in Chinese history as the worst king of all time and in the 3,512 years from the start of the shung to the fall of the last Ching Emperor there were some real stinkers in there it said that his name Joe that's fourth tone was a pejorative name given to him to show disrespect the Joe was the part of the saddle that was near the horse's rump or Underside and its main role was to keep the saddle from sliding forward anyway it strategic location right under or near the horse's poop shoot made it the likeliest part of the saddle to become soiled so you can imagine how much they like this guy if they gave him a name like that like Caligula who was to follow him almost aund centuries later dein started off good he supposedly had this amazing strength and was just a mountain of a man capable of all kinds of amazing feats and this tyrannical ruler like his kindred spirit King J of Shia had an evil woman behind the scenes egging him on to do the most outrageous and detestable things King Jia had the evil concubine Moi and Shang King Joe had DOI whose greatest pleasure was to watch the painful suffering of others now dein or join he did a lot of outrageous things on his own and at the behest of his sadistic wife there was a book written during the Ming Dynasty one of the later dynasties in China that Chronicles the period of the fall of the Shang the book goes into all kinds of gruesome detail about Jo Shin's exploits it's called the funan Yen y the creation of the Gods and two stories in particular sort of Define this last king of Shang these were the rolin and the paing the joer roline the alcohol pool and meat forest was a place of debauchery that would have looked right at home in Bob guion's Caligula movie from 1979 a lake or more likely a pool of some sort was dug and filled with wine this was the jolure the wine pool and the meat Forest well that was located on a little island in the middle of the pool and these trees were planted there and meat skewers were from the branches and this was the rolin or meat Forest presumably these origies would be held there and they have unlimited wine to drink from the pool and if they got hungry they could snack on the meats hanging in the meat Forest no idea if it was Yang roar or what it was and before you go and say oh that couldn't be in 1999 archaeologist discovered a 1 and 1/2 meter deep pool among the Shang ruins measuring 130x 20 M which in my estimation is the size of what the average wine pool might be and it was discovered not far from LA young but the topper of all Toppers the one that every Source I read mentioned was the poer Shing or Cannon burning punishment this grizzly punishment was attributed to the wicked Queen DOI he had this long bronze cylinder like a cannon and the inside of the cylinder would be filled with white hot burning charcoal and through the magic of physics and thermodynamics the cannon itself would turn equally hot now whoever it was that was being punished or who was being utilized as the source of amusement was made to embrace or press up against this searing hot piece of metal in watching this gruesome exhibition amused doy to no end while the Shan King had his mind on matters of Deery Joe Sheen received word that a certain person named G Chong was growing in the esteem of the people and that various tribes loyal to the Shang were now doing it about face and declaring all their loyalty to this G Chang and this of course is the Future King Wen of Joe and G Chang dutifully reported in to Joe Shen who immediately threw him into prison and during his period of incarceration as The Story Goes G Chang wrote the eing or book of changes that confucious called the most important of all the classics it was The Ultimate Guide to divination this is all covered in uh two chapters from the 18-part history of Chinese philosophy series chi chang after seven years of imprisonment by chin was set free after the Shang King was given bribes and Gifts of lots of gorgeous women and all kinds of delights so G CH was set free and at once began organizing all the various tribes and peoples and this new military force poured out of the Wei River Valley from the west and swept into the Shang territory and this all culminated in the Battle of muya and join seeing he was finished supposedly committed suicide and his evil queen DOI she got beheaded so all these antics coupled with his ruthless and autocratic ways had simply turned his own people against him the Mandate of Heaven was not with King joen and it came to pass in early 1046 BC that King wo of Joe along with the assistance of jangu put an end to Shang King Joo now there's a standalone episode on jya CHP 258 he was a right-hand man to this G Chong that I mentioned already several times G Chang of course is the Joe Dynasty founder King Wen and King wo he helped him get rid of the Shang and establish the Joe dynasty of this G family at the Battle of muya the last Shang King went down in defeat and it's from this date that we have the start of the Joe Dynasty the last of China's Bronze Age dynasties and once again muya is ated at 10:46 BC which is the start date of the western Joe Dynasty we'll get more into Kings when and woo and the Duke of Joe or Joe gong in the next podcast when we look at the Joe Dynasty again another Dynasty famous for its beautiful bronzes starting from the Joe Chinese culture really begins to get refined and the stage is being set for the introduction of all the great Chinese philosopher and so once again this is lla Montgomery wishing everybody a fond and appreciative farewell from the city of Los Angeles California join me next time won't you for another tasty morsel from the vast and Sumptuous Buffet of Chinese history "
