"hello our friends evolutionary energy arts family hello there welcome back welcome back take two um yeah we had some strange little glitches going on okay everything seems okay this time so many of us are familiar with one two maybe even three or four different mythologies around the world and again to what depth as well we see that there are similarities and some will say everything is astro theology it's just basically anthropomorphizing nature uh in other words you know given a personification to forces of nature but so many of these myths seem to be more than just that they could be that but they could be a lot more at the same time again we're always kind of being put in this well are you a creationist or are you an evolutionist well maybe there's both and and maybe with the myths there's both going on as well as far as are they ancient aliens are they extraterrestrials or are they simply forces of nature you know are these stories are just trying to communicate universal truths again maybe it's all the above it could be and then there's so many things that they do put in front of us to kind of get us to go down a certain path and in in some cases those paths get people kind of edgy and upset at each other if they don't believe their interpretation over another interpretation so there's lots to explore lots to understand lots to acknowledge and and then some yeah and i'm looking down in the corner and and it's showing that it's 80 degrees and sunny at the moment and very high uv our dna is cooking guys it's cooking so when we look at these pictures what do you see what i see is i see what looks to be a lot of different sized people radically different sized people obviously this is coming from egypt and when we look to egypt and we look all around the globe we find the same sorts of stories we see that there are these beings that are a little bit more than human they're very human but yet they're more than human and many have called them gods and again this is where everything gets so convoluted and you know here we have the abrahamic tradition saying there's one god but if you look into hinduism for instance it'll say yeah there's one source so they're in agreement but their hinduism will say but there's countless gods but only one source so again how do we label it when we look to the bible and we look at some of the very first verses and it talks about elohim which is a plural word plural and in fact there are even translations like deuteronomy 32 8 the oldest one we have says that the nations were split according to the number of the sons of the gods and if we do read that it reads very much kind of an olympian sort of way where you see there are multiple gods again multiple beings that are technologically more advanced and maybe a little bit more advanced with just understanding how the universe works so here we see you know these humans in this picture here i mean if she's five feet tall i i don't know what are these beings eight to ten feet tall these other females you know this being appears to be 12 or more feet tall and then we see all these other representations so you know we have universal legends every single nation on the planet every tribe of people have legends of giants legends of giants and in all sorts of way too i mean there's a lot of scary legends of giants that uh show disregard or perhaps a little lack of caring for humanity and or even just that plain old annoyance with humanity some are very very negative from the human standpoint again and again these are things that are found every single corner of the globe and why why why do you get the little wikipedias when you bring up the anunnaki word and again anunnaki really it just means those that come from the heavens you know those that are not from earth and so it's really a broad term and there have been many many many different beings from many different uh places that have walked the earth and isn't this a cute photo oh it's really interesting that's a big naga-ish dragonish being there with with the pope but then again we know that the vatican understands that the religion they espouse is it's just a front it's just a cover it's for the consumption of the masses they understand the bigger workings they do and i just have a feeling that this picture really isn't that far from the truth in some ways no absolutely and before we go any farther i just want to invite everybody make sure you subscribe to both channels evolutionary energy arts and ee arts both have unique videos and make sure you have a little bell clicked hopefully you get a notification or or two and we will have a video up pretty much every single day of the year maybe maybe about three or four days out of the year where there won't be a video on either but typically there's at least one video going up on a channel and we try to get one on each each day so 15 facts about the sumerian kings list when gods ruled the earth now this whole concept of gods ruling the earth again it's not just coming from sumeria you'll have people that want to dismiss all the anunnaki legends all these thoughts of these extraterrestrials and so they'll just say you know zechariah sitchin is a crackpot or he's he's a mason he's he's an illuminati what have you but you know he's not the only one to translate these tablets and these tablets are not unique because the same myths are found everywhere if we really look now the problem is there's definitely a book burning going on and the book burning has been going on throughout history throughout history we have of course we talked about the library of alexandria and all that knowledge lost but there's other libraries that have been destroyed there's other artifacts that could shed truth to our our history that have been destroyed often in times of war often while there's war going on soldiers will come in they'll have a another job given to him and it might be as simple as go to this temple and destroy everything in it this happens regularly regularly it happened in india when the british were colonizing india and they went into some areas that had holy quote unquote um scripts holy books holy stories there well holy is again something that you know for one person something could be holy for somebody else it could be sacrilegious but the fact is these things get covered up now many of you might know the oddity involved with the sumerian kings list because it talks about these people ruling for insane long periods of time so among the numerous ancient text manuscripts and scrolls that completely disagree with mainstream history or at least offer a complementary view we find that the ancient smearing kings list which according to many is one of the most mysterious and important ancient texts ever discovered on earth why because it suggests that ancient rulers had incredibly lengthy reigns aloo lim became king he ruled for twenty eight thousand eight hundred years and then we go to thirty six thousand year rule for al-azhar and then there's two kings they rule for sixty eight thousand i mean sorry sixty four thousand eight hundred years combined then eridog fell and kingship was taken to bad tibira in batavira en men luana ruled for forty three thousand two hundred years the ancient text describes in great detail a time when earth was ruled by beings referred to as gods for thousands of years the list composed in ancient sumerian offers details about numerous generations of kings that rule over the land of ancient sumer the list not only offers us their names but details to their supposed length and location of kingship so you know this is fascinating to see all these numbers and here's the music the shepherd and i remember when rex bear over at leake project was convinced at one point that the music was jesus yeshua and you know it was at one time i'm not sure what he believes now i really haven't watched uh much of rex in a couple years now but i remember he was really really um excited about that but the music the shepherd ruled for 36 000 years and then you have three kings that rule for a hundred and eight thousand years fragments of this list were discovered in the 1900s by german american researcher hermann hilprecht at after 1906 18 other lists have been discovered dating from the second half of the insan dynasty there are more than a dozen copies of sumerian kings list found in babylon susa assyria and the royal library of nineveh from the 7th century bc the best preserved specimen of the sumerian kings list is called the weld bloondell prism which is clay cunify uniform inscribed vertical prism housed in ashmolean museum so is it truly true that these beings these so-called gods lived that long you know we have a lot of different stories and with all the different belief systems and everything that we've read we're i'm not saying throw out everything that you've read i do believe there's definitely truth in there and they said these beings did live for a very long time but i'm also saying recognize that they leave to us what they need for us to know to kind of control our psyche absolutely and again i go back to the fact that two-thirds of the world is thinking through and looking at everything through abrahamic lens so even if you awaken to the fact that geez maybe you know the mainstream line of thought associated with christianity islam and and judaism of which of course there's so many different varieties but if you go with that common denominator that main picturing in your in your mind that we've all had the indoctrination of it it kind of it makes you look at things from that perspective you're always thinking of things in abrahamic you know terms you think about the flood you think about noah but these flood stories are universal and the sources that we have from other sources non-abrahamic are in many cases much much older much older and then when we look to the fact again that what book is every single president's putting his hand on whether it's obama whether it's bush whether it's 45 whether it's 46 whether it was clinton whether it was reagan all of them they put their hands on the bible and so you know again it's the controllers lens that we look through and there are those that literally believe the earth is 6 000 years old well you know there is when you look back evidence to show that there was a major flood about 6 000 years ago and many had to restart again and we look back to that 12 500 13 000 years ago and there was a catastrophe that was way larger than that flood at that time period when we look to the vedic line of thinking we there are different yugas yuga just means an age and we're leaving the kali yuga so we're we're leaving the kali yuga now thankfully and when you look at it so this is our sun this is the the great central sun which our sun goes around so as we're drawing closer to the great central sun we are also being bombarded with a lot more energy a lot more life force and that energy and that life force is changing us when we're in the kali yuga we're the farthest away from that great central sun and so we're receiving the smallest amount of information because late is information from it and then now we're starting to cross this line we're crossing this line and we're going into dua para and then we'll be entreted and then we'll be in the golden age after that we do have a long way to go guys we have a long way to go so the celebration here is just that we're leaving the darkness you could view it if you want to view it according to the solstices then you know when we're at this point you know here it's it's like december uh 25th you know i should say we celebrate on december 25th i should say 21st for winter solstice and summer solstice so you know we're leaving the winter we're starting to head towards spring yes so i mean the good news is with every year we are getting more and more information um sent here so more information coming to our human bodies which and enlightens us and and i mean that on several different levels enlightens us in the sense where we understand more we perceive more we we can learn more from each other we can heal more so all of these things are really really important when it comes to learning and understanding these things absolutely you know another way to look at it too is just simply when we're out way out here uh there's it's there's not as much life out this way and in fact as we've shared with peter dunno who was the bulgarian mystic prophet he actually said this was a dead zone where there was horrible horrible catastrophes that have occurred tragedies and and perhaps even entire planets that had been destroyed in in great battles so it's a very very dark zone in more ways than one kind of like going through you know the valley of the shadow of death so to speak and when you're here when you're down here there's there's a lot more life there's a lot more civilizations as well so we're coming closer to to places where there's just a lot more beings and it's fascinating that as we go through this area according to the vedic line of thinking humanity in the kali yuga doesn't live long at all now when we're in the duopara we live you know maybe 10 times as long we might live to be 800 000 years old now isn't that something that is echoed in the bible when you talk about methuselah lived 969 years and other of these uh you know abrahamic forefathers so to speak lived these extraordinary lives that were very very long well we see that in other cultures too then when you get to the tretta it's even longer it's like 10 000 years when we get to the to the golden age and humans are like the gods we live like a hundred thousand years and perhaps it's just because we're exposed to a lot more intense life force you know again the science that we learn and we should know this because of the plague upon the land is not accurate no it's not you know it's it's just really manipulated but there are things in there that are of importance and who that send people on a very important path and that's your path of truth and as you're walking your truth and understanding what you believe um it's kind of a celebratory time it's a time where hey wow this this really fits with me right now how come let's go explore this so it is a path of many many rabbit holes and it's okay to go down every single one i think people wonder sometimes am i am i wasting my time by going down this rabbit hole why am i going down this rabbit hole you're waking up your dna so no it's not a waste of time it's very important food for your soul yep and so again you know of course there's other noahs in other societies and there is a hindu noah as well and as with noah all living beings on earth are said to distend descend from creatures he rescued from a great flood isn't it fascinating we keep seeing these things the earth uh gets kind of filled up with people with all sorts of life and then society and everything is almost totally wiped out and then it starts all over again and when we're talking about the other uh myths and legends about humans living a long time we've talked about this one before too when we look to the greek legends and myths the golden age was before soos it was before the time of the the gods the olympian gods like zeus and his father reigned over a golden age and kronos is also associated with time when men lived amongst the gods and there were no rules because everybody just did the right thing it was always spring peace and harmony prevailed humans did not have to work to feed themselves well you know again sin quote unquote it creeps into the world in the bible and all of a sudden we have to toil for our food but maybe it's not really sin maybe it just has to do with the leadership on the planet and how far away from light we are again you know we we descend from a 5d reality in which we are more like light beings we could literally live off a prana we do not have to eat at all and then we go all the way down to 3d where you know again we're much lower vibrationally uh we're denser in many ways and and also we have to change our ways and we end up consuming heavier food many people now are finding that they're they're craving lighter food or even eating less just overall and that's because we're we're shifting we're going out of that 3d we're heading into 4d right now now in the golden age again humans lived to a very old age but maintained a youthful appearance and eventually they died peacefully as if falling asleep and their spirits were said to live on as guardians of the mortals uh well that that sounds like spirit guides does not or angels depend on how you want to word it because again what is an angel well the greek translation means messenger but from our perspective what we've seen you know those that are truly angels they're they're just in service to others to the highest degree they're in in service to maintaining everything in a maintaining homeostasis in the universe yes they are and they're really important part of our life and their important part to be connected to and to desire to connect with them and receive their guidance if you so choose but again it's it's a choice do you want to step out there when whenever you're ready then you will you will step out and you will explore and you will find new understanding and it'll be it'll be great so silver age zeus overthrew his father chronos ruled over the silver age in subsequent ages zeus created the silver race of man to be inferior in appearance and wisdom to the last so purposefully dumbing down humanity and again that's the the vehicle not not the eternal soul because the eternal soul is just that it's eternal it's just that the soul is in a vehicle that does not have the all the abilities you know we got downgraded from a ferrari to maybe a camaro you know something like that and then we get downgraded again and before you know it we're all driving hugos yes that's exactly kind of what what the story says and here man has to grow his food and seek shelter but they still lived pretty long but then zeus destroyed this race for refusing to worship the gods nonetheless after death the silver race became the blessed spirits of the underworld and so we could see equivalent when we start to look at the biblical story in many ways and again we have that vengeful nasty god in the old testament and people will try to justify all the atrocities that are done but it's it's just you can't justify those atrocities because again you know the condoning of slavery and and so many others justification for murder you're told thou shall not kill but then you're also told kill every man woman and child in jericho and many other places as they were doing their conquering of the canaanites so you know contradictions abound but then when we see this and again these myths are as ancient and in many cases more ancient than what we have in the biblical story again if you look at the oldest old complete old testament we have that's like 900 a.d 80 80 80. we have bits and pieces of of some of the talmud for instance that might be two to three hundred bc but not not completing in its entirety and again it's something that's always been ongoing revised and we look to the oldest gospel of john and there's there's hundreds if not thousands of edits so again you know it's maintaining that narrative for the masses and hiding from them the truth the bronze age zeus created the first recognizably human the bronze rays from the hardwood have ash trees it says war and violence was the purpose and passion of the bronze race odd detail about this race is that they did not eat bread hessia didn't say why their weapons tools and even homes were forged abroad and that racial man was destroyed by zeus again with the great flood so that's that flood myth there and there is a heroic age and this is the only age that improves upon the era that and preceded it and it's the only age that does not correspond with any metal the demigods of this age fought at thebes and at troy when the heroes died they went to the elysian fields an area of the underworld that was the final resting place of the virtuous the heroic age frankly seems to be out of place in this scheme and it's apparently a tribute to homer's epic poem the odyssey and then the iron age at the time of hessia's writing in the 700s bce the world was already in the throes of the iron age which is your kali yuga earthly existence is one of toil and misery all manner of evils came into being in this age piety and other virtues disappeared and most of the gods who were still left on earth abandoned it it was said that zeus would destroy this race someday and babies will be born with gray hair that's that's how again how short our lives are so to speak in this age during the golden age people are said to be 30 feet tall or more they're totally virtuous and wise and life spans are a hundred thousand years and with each age both the height and the life spans decrease so you know it's it's so fascinating to see that these are not even the only sources whether we're looking at you know the egyptian the sumerian or the vedic they're not the only sources and we see the shemsu the celestial architects of the great sphinx 800 000 year old monument according to some line of thinking but who who were these beings and and who really were you know these egyptian gods where many will just lump them in and say they're the same as the beings that come from nibiru but again these beings were exposed to these beings at different times in the cycles because again they live in different places so to speak and they live at different frequencies so as we descend we tend to find more and more beings that are getting increasingly violent and in service to self as we ascend we find the opposite we find more and more beings that are in service to others and and they're more benevolent right so i mean that's a good idea to to me anyway is to remain open remain open to other energies yet train yourself when you feel an energy that just doesn't strike you right really pay attention to that too because you need to be careful you do need to guard yourself it's really not about just opening yourself to anything and everything because there's they can affect you in the sense of an indirect way so you don't even want to open yourself up to that but do learn about that love feeling from your heart chakra and that feeling of peace and centeredness and allow that to allow that to lead you so mamathoe who lived in the 3rd century bc was an egyptian priest and historian so he lived during the reign of 1st ptolemy and 2nd ptolemy he like many others after him referred to the gods and demigods as the ones that ruled over egypt earlier so again there's so many traditions that say that rulership descended from the heavens and eventually was handed off to humans but originally it was the gods and then the demigods and again you know people will look to six genesis and and say the nephilim and again yes nephilim rafim anakim there's different types of giants there again this is again the reader's digest convent condensed version this is not giving you the full picture you need to go and look at other mythologies again what book are all the presidents who again are part of the leadership of this cabal that runs this world i mean how many of you trust every word that comes out of 46 out of good old jb how many of you trust every word that comes out of obama's mouth or clinton's or for that matter of the bushes or 45. yet where are they putting their trust in their faith they're lying their hands right on that b-i-b-l-e and again that's taking the truth and that's distorting it enough so that humanity can't really see the truth it's the number one published book of all time do you think if that was the hidden truth the thing they don't want you seeing that would be the number one published book of all time can we see the censorship on yt can we see the censorship on twitter on facebook everywhere there's no space there's no censorship for the bible any thoughts of that are just really an illusion no it's everywhere do you open up the drawer at a motel 6 at night and find you know and and find yourself the uh you know something esoteric and deep like the emerald tablets the thoth no no you got the b-i-b-l-e right there it's it's in order to cloud our thinking again to get us to see something from a certain angle when we look at this again you know this is the same thing being stated here minethoe established four dynasties before many's two gods two of gods two were gods demigods and a fourth transition transition suggesting the origin of the egyptian civilization can be attributed to seven major deities ta'ra shugeb osiris seth and horus who ruled over the lands of egypt for a period of twelve thousand three hundred years after them a second dynasty ruled over ancient egypt led by thoth composed of twelve divine pharaohs who ruled over 1500 years after which there were 30 demigods rose to power and these were usually identified with the followers of horus and were symbolized as falcons and ruled over lands of egypt for a period of 6 thousand years after the rule of these otherworldly beings chaos ruled over the lands of egypt until many managed to restore order and unify the lands of ancient egypt but again we could look at this as being the descent through the yugas as well as the intermixing of humans with other beings and and there are going to be other beings that tend to take advantage of situations um that just seems to be the nature of life as we move to a denser reality there's other beings that hold on to their understanding and knowing and knowledge and they're able to steer other beings but they're very careful to stay out of sight i'm going to jump all the way over here first when we look over to chinese legends look at the first emperors of china 180 000 years 110 000 years 456 000 years we find a lot of the same things again and another ancient civilization again another one of the first major civilizations on this planet and in this go-around again we should always say this go around and when we look to the stories it's the same stories we see the same stories over and over and over again the most ancient myths involved 10 legendary kings or gods who guided people through the prehistoric beginnings there was demigods half god half human who lived among the people and taught them the rules of civilization and then it gets into this particular ruler called fushi who happened to be a musician and very happy so it's just fascinating that we see all these same stories and like the rebuilding of the earth after cataclysm this happens time and time and time again and so if we look to mother shipton and her prophecies mother shipton says that after we go through these incredible earth changes destruction war everything and the earth is like totally totally redone what does humanity see it sees the silvery ship appear in the sky and beings come out and they start guiding us on how to make things anew the right way and and you know understanding these are beings that also understand their own sovereignty so i feel the way if they're going to i feel if they're going to lead or teach they're going to lead in a way that's going to help you recognize your sovereignty not be not make you fearful of stepping outside of certain lines so it's not one tradition these are universal stories and yeah it is getting hard to find a lot of details on these um there are some great books that have been put out there you know graham graham hancock's done a lot of really good work there's so many amazing authors out there that have worked to uncover the the ancient civilizations that have existed on earth and just how advanced they were and they chose not to have what we have now as far as the technology they could have had technologies like we have now but they recognize the danger in that so they chose to live in harmony with the world with the with the planet itself and that's why you don't have those leftover relics and of course you know when the cataclysms come they do wash a lot of things away we know the power of water but yet they built in stone they built in these megalithic manners that still have withstood the test of time and often with technologies that we couldn't duplicate right now all right and right now what they teach us in school books is we use like hammers and stones and there was no technology yet these huge monolithic things are all over the earth and i don't even think there is a crane that can lift um a fraction of what those blocks are in egypt i don't think we have an earthly piece of equipment that could remotely start to build on that but in school they tell us we use chisels and hammers or you know pumapunku and and you know what we see down in peru same thing it's just amazing the technology that was used but we were way more advanced in those days and we were we had so much more wisdom than the leadership of this world does because again the leadership of this world is the leadership of a dark age and that leadership cannot take us out of a dark age so i mean that's the bottom line we're going to go where they can't and that's why they're doing all the things they are doing right now so as always guys be as prepared as possible have that spiritual practice you know we would never go a day without doing mantras because they tie us to the beings that are up in the higher vibrational frequencies well well away from the beings that control this dark kali yuga thank you also for your support on patreon and kofi we couldn't
