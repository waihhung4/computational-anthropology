"China has been around for a few thousand years and many countries have but in world history China is the only country that's been at the top three or four times China has also collapsed three or four times has been catastrophe but in history Rome was great once Egypt was great once Great Britain was great once but China's been great three or four times you totally collapse but and I don't know why but it's the only country that after has been at the bottom for a while has turned around three or four times and risen to the top again [Music] Mr Rogers reads his question on a long civilization no time scale stretches of course 6 millionaire he mentioned the ancient Egyptian civilization the Romanian pair and the Great Britain impair so with a better start with a brief outline of the world history by the first Millennium PC the Egyptian civilization on the banks of the Nile and the Sumerian civilization in the Mesopotamian Valley has both reached the height of their Glory and around the same time the minoan civilization on the island of Crete also flourished although these civilizations seem to be developed independently their life cycles follow a similar pattern they reach their Pinnacles then claps and disappear altogether after being invaded and conquered by Outsiders why did they screw civilizations fail to rise again and doubt the so after even Immortal specimen or look down on the Eastern Mediterranean region from space at this time he would notice that while most human groups in this region were hunters and the gatherers following food sources constantly on the moon leaving a nomadical lifestyle in his first will the ancient Egyptian Sumerian and the minoan civilizations which are developed into complex settled societies World outliers the elevation of solar and the lunar calendars in ancient Egypt the construction of large cities and sophisticated immigration system in Asian Summer and the building of great palaces and the road networks on the ancient island of Crete are typical signs of long-term settlement but for a long time these civilizations were isolated and vulnerable like small islands in the high sea intender of being swallowed up by the reading waves the invasion of the numeric peoples as a well-known English historian H.G well supported the two ways of life specialized in opposite directions it was inevitable that the normal fork and the settled fog Should Crash that the nomads should seem hard barbariance to the settled peoples and the set whole peoples solved and effeminate and very good plunder to the normal peoples Along The Fringe of developing civilizations there must have been a constant reading and a bickering between hardy normal traps and the mountain tribes and the more numerous and less warlike peoples in the tongues and The Villages between 22 78 and 2154 BC Putin horse invaded Acadian Empire bringing an end 2016 civilization without building another in its place between 1790 and 1560 BC the heat ties build a impaired in Asia manner Asian the Babylonia Empire had lost most of its Holdings to the source and yeast Asian power centers of Zuma was just largely destroyed and abundant between 1782 and 1630 BC the wandering Western sea mice sees the Throne of Egypt and destroyed the Middle Kingdom between 1400 and the 1200 BC the Palace of agnosis was destroyed never rebuilt and left deserted and finally sometimes around 1177 BC the most murderers of Warriors known as sea peoples sailed to destroy the establish award and started a new one where they are Great Migration as well came the downfall of ancient Egypt the Egyptian inscriptions read in part they came from the sea in their wall shapes and no one could stand against them resistance was a futile their palaces were burned as their cities distorted this is a history of the Eastern Mediterranean area as a whole this is the 12th of the normal force the devastating Conquest upon settled Forks one after another but one could imagine what if say to the folks one if there's some critical Port the Society of sedentary people not only had a larger population and more land but had also become well organized well-equipped educated and trained and that's strong enough not only to defend their homes but also to fight back against the enormous Undertaker their base camps the main historical narrative would have been very different now if our Immortal specimen will look down on the East End of the Eurasia continent you will see that in the same historical period contrary to what happened in the Eastern Mediterranean area the story in China is the success of the settled Fox who assimilate and integrated with the normal force and followed by Sicily's expansion of the sedentary civilization visited the Middle East and East Asia followed two distinct evolutionary paths in the Middle East The Nomad Fox conquered the entire settled Fox society and then report a new Society while retaining the normal tradition on the ruins of the original civilization in East Asia zero constant resistance and counter Conquest the settled Force eventually extended the entire set of the society to a larger area and although it will also be ruled by powerful pneumatical folks from time to time the new Society still retained the tradition of sedentary civilization in essence Mr Rogers also asks why the Roman Empire and the British Empire became number one for a single period of history and then never recovered after their decline in fact the Arabian pair in the 7th to 10th Century the Mongolian pair in the 13th to 14th century and the Ottoman Empire in the 16th to 19th century all the same they never resurrected after their collapse well the fundamental reason is this this in Paris were all nomadically dominated impacts their rulers or either horse riding No Mess or come already no mess or shipwriting novice and although the nomadic rulers also learned many cultural establishments and refine us from the country and gradually became part of the civilization they all follow the same pattern of rice and fall it begins to be the unity upon Kindred normal tribes then reaching their Heyday in the war of conquest and settle down on the conquered land then at the point in time quickly fall apart after the failure of the fresh overseas Adventures or the failure of internal ethnic assimilation and cultural integration or both takes the Roman Empire as an example the Barbarian traps that destroyed the Eastern Mediterranean civilizations were in fact the very creators of the Asian Greco-Roman civilization before the establishment of Alexander's Greece impair the Celtic barbarians from gold in her room 100 years later Rome unified the Italian Peninsula and 200 years later Mediterranean Sea became a Roman Lake under such circumstances the new civilization not only took over all the settled lands of the old civilization but also constituting a larger and more complex structure of stakeholder society in which it was no longer possible to revive all the civilizations of ancient The Babylon even the Persia and Haitian Greece but as the Roman Empire ran out of a foreign settled societies to conquer and its internal corruption group when its northern borders were invaded by the more powerful and ferocious Germanic barbarians is done for was inevitable the rest of the fall of the British film pair followed the same bed the seafaring period people from British Islands having mastered the ones the navigation and the Weaponry conquered many setos cities on different continents and built a was impair on which the Sun never sets however when there was no new settled Society to conquer and the more powerful Rivals arose it could not escape the same fate as other nomadically dominated Empires now let's turn to China One conclusion among the Western Scholars is that Chinese civilization doesn't seem to have a beginning as Dr Henry Kissinger put it in his book China stretches into the historical consciousness as the established state requiring only restoration not creation of course the Chinese civilization has its beginning but it is not a beginning with some kind of Victorious Conquest which is more familiar with normal it is a decisive victory of settled folk who achieved solid Unity of Kindred Villages and talks from Museum the yellow Emperor to die with the king of Shia in the third millennium BC all the legendary funding rulers of China were re-establishing not creating an imperative set of society each of these funding rulers made a unique contribution to the progress of settlement not only in terms of cultural integration and ethnic assimilation but also in terms of the period article expansion of territory and population Thai became the ruler of the Shadow dynasty was a landmark event in history in those ancient times the Greek flags were common people in other parts of the world had only two choices to be swallowed up by flood or to flee far away from it but the Chinese people and only Chinese people saw a third option to rely on human power to label the land and divert the water a chosen king with a high moral standard managed to unite all local laws gather massive human and material resources in his kingdom to complete this huge engineering project of flood control and from there on the settlement of the Chinese people were permanently fixed in the form of nine states which have not changed for 4 000 years since then through large-scale Water Management project early Chinese Century societies greatly expanded their boundaries and effectively reached their critical point of survival from destruction by the surrounding nomadical societies Nation the Chinese Texas gave different names to the Norman folk in the directions of South north east and west showing that by this time China's Century Agricultural Society had already expanded into an almost secure territory centered in the middle and the lower plain of the Yellow River squeezing all the pneumatic traps into the remote surrounding area this is why China came to be known as the central Kingdom although its size was sometimes larger and sometimes smaller Mr Rogers realized that China has fallen many times in history there have been many periods of the Civil War in terrarium and the chaos in Chinese history this appearance he refers to a no other than the similar Dark Ages when China as an Agricultural Society of settled folk was overtaken by Norma the folk around the same time as when the Germanic Barbarian invaded Roman Empire quite a few wondering traps living in northern China known collectively as the five rules finally became strong enough to break throat defense boundaries of northern China however and like the Romanian pair which completely collapsed under the attack and could not be rebuilt the five rules enter the child and embrace the Chinese culture based on sedentary civilization and become part of a new Central Kingdom of the century of greedy integration the great impacts of the three and the tongue dynasties as a reconstruction of Qing and hand dynasties encompassed more people covered larger territories and reached Higher Culture Peaks then history repeated itself in the 13th century the Empire the greatest step impaired in human history grows almost overnight sweeping over much of the known words including of of China but I like the rest of the world the  density that was established in the land of the central Kingdom once again out of their own tradition it was not a nomatic Mongol Empire anymore but a great extent a copy of the Qing and hand sedentary kingdoms in the case of china although the rulers were replaced by the foreigners its own cultural sphere actually expanded into the ruler's Homeland furthermore because of the ever elevating critical point of survival after each class as if by law of nature the Chinese state has increased its capacity to rebuild itself it's a great unification of Ming and Qin dynasties from the 15th to the 19th century was a repetition of History encompassing more peoples covering a larger territory and reaching a Higher Culture Peak at this point I believe I have answered Miss Rogers question in a very comprehensive way so knowing all this how should we understand the world as it is today first we need to recognize that the grid Rejuvenation of Chinese Nation today is still with its uniqueness and can't be compared to or predicted by the rise and the fall of other impairs in history comparing China to Germany and Japan in recent history or see China as an emerging superpower that threatens existing world order a misleading if not incorrect the historical process of China from its decline to its Rejuvenation since the late days of qingdansi can still be seen as a repetition of History that is the recommendation of its own tradition and the gradual creation of a new civilization by absorbing elements from different civilizations this is a unique characteristics of Chinese civilization and the fundamental reason why it became the most continuous and successful settled civilization in the world on a global scale since the end of the 19th century with stronger sovereignty of the nation-states tighter border controls and increasing urbanization the phenomenon of Greater migration of ethnic groups have gradually disappeared well the population of Sato societies has increased dramatically compared to most times of the human slavery we can see that the word day is a globally settled World they are no longer an entire Society of horse riding or came already or body riding people if we take an outline of world history and regard European Colonial and imperialists the walls of conquered in the 17th to the 19th centuries as the last great victory of nomad Fox over settle the folk in the recent six Millennia that the flourishing of sedentary societies throughout the world since the 20th century especially since the end of the second World War means that sedentary civilization has finally dominated the globe and that we have reached some kind of the end of History now we are entering a new year the era of global system terrorization in which all countries in the world are facing new challenges why are there more and more internal conflicts in Western countries why has China continuously proposed Global initiatives Bri building a community with a shared future of mankind GSI GDI and GCI the answers lie in the historical perspective described above "
