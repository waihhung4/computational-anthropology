"what we're going to be exploring is what geologist recognizes some of the greatest floods that have ever happened in the history of the earth and they are truly hard to wrap your head around until you spent a week in those Landscapes and what's interesting about these floods is they seem to be associated with a lot of other interesting phenomena such as the mass extension of the great megap possible evidence for multi-impact events you had survivors of two [Music] types those who survived by the luck of the draw and those who survived because they knew it was going to happen they planned for it they prepared for it you think they knew it was going to happen I think we could make a strong argument there was somebody did know the Nibiru cataclysm Theory and Randall Carlson's repeating cataclysm Theory both delve into the realm of catastrophic events impacting Earth yet they stem from markedly different foundations and implications now what we do is we throw some type of an impact into the mix it seems to fill gaps that were um at this point still unexplained the Nibiru cataclysm Theory posits the existence of a rogue planet Nibiru which supposedly passes through our solar system with an elongated orbit causing gravitational upheavals and potentially catastrophic events on Earth every 3,600 years this Theory largely based on interpretations of ancient texts emphasizes a single extraterrestrial trigger for apocalyptic events in contrast Randall Carlson's theory is grounded in geological and astronomical evidence suggesting that Earth has undergone periodic cataclysmic events due to a variety of natural causes including Comet impacts volcanic eruptions and Ice Age cycles one of the scenarios would certainly suggest that there were extreme climate changes Carlson a self-taught geologist and Scholar of ancient mythology argues that these repeating cataclysms have shaped human history and the Earth's geology over Millennia while the Nibiru Theory focuses on a specific externally driven cataclysm linked to ancient myths is there a possible hidden connection between Earth cataclysms and Nibiru in space there had to be something we needed to look at that triggered the extreme climate changes that we do see the term Nibiru is deeply embedded in Sumerian and Babylonian mythology it's a name that not only evokes the mysteries of the stars but also connects us to the Divine beliefs and astronomical prowess of ancient Mesopotamian cultures so when we're looking back at Su those are the people that are sort of Reinventing and relearning well part of our modern psychology is to imagine that we are somehow so far Advanced Nibiru is linked to the god Marduk a central figure in the Babylonian Pantheon Marduk represents the meeting point of power Divinity and Cosmic order highlighting nibiru's immense significance in religious texts and its crucial role in the astronomical and calendrical systems of that era when it comes to the astronomical significance of Nibiru the Babylonians held it in high esteem Nibiru was considered the highest point of the ecliptic marking the summer solstice's position this wasn't just an arbitrary point in the sky it was vital for their calendrical system influencing agricultural practices and religious ceremonies the tracking of Nibiru and its association with specific constellations underscored its importance for ancient astronomers these Scholars of the sky leveraged their knowledge of nibiru's path to guide Agricultural Science plan religious festivals and interpret Omens integrating Celestial observations into the fabric of their daily lives drawing parallels between civilizations Nibiru in Mesopotamian mythology and the Greek star fean offers a fascinating glimpse into the universal human endeavor to make sense of the cosmos Fon The Shining one linked to the sun god Helios was said to drive the sun's Chariot across the sky this myth much like the significance of nibber to the Mesopotamians illustrates the critical role celestial bodies played in shaping the ancient world's understanding of time space both Nibiru and Fon stories reflect a deep-seated belief in the power of celestial entities to influence or even dictate the fundamental rhythms of Earthly existence zcharia sitchin the 12th Planet published in 1976 kicked off a series of books that weave together ancient mythology astronomy and the notion of extraterrestrial life into narrative that's as fascinating as it is controversial sitchin introduced the world to the idea of Nibiru a mysterious yet to be discovered planet with a wildly elliptical orbit taking it deep into the cosmos far beyond Neptune every 3,600 years but where did such an outof this world Theory come from sitchin's answer ancient Sumerian uniform tablets which he interpreted as chronicling the existence of this 12th Celestial body in our solar system if you also count the Sun and moon at the heart of sitchin's theory lies the anunaki a race of advanced beings from Nibiru who supposedly visited Earth about 450,000 years ago sitchin's narrative doesn't just place these extraterrestrials on Earth it credits them with genetically engineering early humans to create modern Homo sapiens for the purpose of mining gold needed on their home planet it's a tale that marries the Genesis of human civilization with Cosmic visitors suggesting that the advanced astronaut iCal knowledge of the Sumerians including their awareness of nibiru's orbit was a gift from these other worldly ancestors sitchin's proposal of nibiru's 3,600 year orbit stems from his unique interpretation of the Sumerian numeral system and their concept of a great year despite the lack of concrete evidence from mainstream science to back up nibiru's existence or its effect on our planet the idea has captured the imagination of many it's even sparked theories linking Nibiru to mass extinction events on Earth with some suggesting that its gravitational pull might fling comets and asteroids towards Earth triggering catastrophic events what we certainly do see here is a clustering right around 13,000 years ago that looks pretty evident to me sitchin's work draws an interesting parallel to the theories of Emanuel velkovski especially those laid out in his 1950s book worlds in Collision like sitchin velikovsky turned to ancient text interpreting them as accounts of catastrophic astronomical events that reshaped early human history and mythology however velikovsky focused on collisions within our inner solar system while sitchin took the narrative further into space introducing an extraterrestrial Dimension with the anunaki and their distant unseen home planet Nibiru both theories while outside mainstream scientific consensus offer a tantalizing glimpse into the possibility that ancient myths might hold more truth about our universe and Origins than we've traditionally believed so here we got mythology mhm and here we have scientific evidence that Earth was blasted as the Mayan Long Count calendar ticked down to its final days in December 2012 the world was a buzz with talk of apocalyptic predictions Central to the frenzy was the mysterious planet Nibiru a rogue Celestial body rumored to be on a collision course with Earth this blend of ancient prophecy modern day conspiracy and astronomical speculation had people everywhere wondering if we were on the brink of cataclysmic destruction the idea was that Nibiru invisible to astronomers yet somehow detected by those in the know would either smash into Earth or come close enough to wreak havoc through its gravitational pull NASA stepping into the fry did something quite unexpected for a scientific organization it directly addressed these doomsday predictions the space agency was clear there was no evidence of Nibiru nor any celestial threat looming on the horizon if a planet were barreling towards us it would have been spotted by countless eyes scanning the skies both professional and amateur NASA's extensive Sky surveys including those by the Widefield infrared survey Explorer had turned up nothing that could be the mythical Nibiru enter Randall Carlson a self-taught geologist with a penchant for catastrophism Carlson has delved deep into Earth's geological record uncovering evidence of repeated cataclysm MC events that have dramatically reshaped our planet from Rapid climate shifts to massive floods and Comet impacts his research paints a picture of Earth's tumultuous history and its impact on human civilization this is where things get interesting could a hypothetical Nibiru fit into this pattern of cataclysms some might speculate that if Nibiru existed its elongated orbit could coincide with these catastrophic periods possibly acting as a gravitational Catalyst for Comet showers or other disruptive events the broader scientific Community however frames these cataclysms within the context of Natural Earth processes and known astronomical phenomena events like asteroid impacts super volcanic eruptions and Ice Age cycles are recognized as part of Earth's Dynamic history but are attributed to natural causes rather than the influence of an unseen Planet the dialogue between speculative theories like Nibiru and the scientific exploration of Earth's cataclysmic past as undertaken by researchers like Carlson underscores our fascination with Cosmic disasters it reflects a deep-seated curiosity about the forces that have shaped and continued to influence our planet while One path Ventures into the realm of myth and pseudoscience the other seeks to unravel the mysteries of our world through the rigorous lens of geology and astronomy together they highlight our ongoing quest to understand the cataclysmic events that Mark Earth's history and the cosmic ballet that plays out out above us see the thing about Noah in the ark though if you go back to that that story is very similar to a story that's in the Epic of Gilgamesh they found like just looking at DNA that all of humanity at one point got wiped out except for like one Village everyone has descended from uh the same group of about 5,000 people picture this a fertile land between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers cradling the dawn of recorded human history this is where the Sumerians thrived a civilization that emerged over 5,000 years ago and left an enduring mark on the world they were one of the first cultures to develop writing a Monumental achievement that changed the course of human history forever their story starts with small farming communities taking advantage of the rich soil deposited by the rivers but things evolved rapidly around 4,000 BCE a city called Uruk started booming becoming one of the world's first major cities this period known as the Uruk period saw the invention of writing the rise of impressive architecture and the expansion of trade networks laying the groundwork for the complex societies that would emerge later fast forward a few centuries and by 2,900 BCE several powerful city states like ER eridu and Leash were vying for dominance each City had its own unique political structure religious beliefs and cultural identity think of them as independent kingdoms each with its own way of life these city states were the heart and soul of Sumerian civilization each one had a Central City surrounded by fields and every aspect of life from politics and economics to religion and social structure revolved around this core the king or Lugal was at the top of the pyramid seen as a divinely chosen leader responsible for the city's well-being he led the Army ensured Justice was served and oversaw religious ceremonies over time priests also became increasingly influential reflecting the strong connection between religion and government speaking of the economy the Sumerians were farmers at heart cultivating grains legumes and fruits their system was like a big redistribution Network people would contribute a portion of their Harvest as taxes and these resources would then be distributed based on social status and needs trade was also crucial allowing them to acquire things like wood and metal that they couldn't find locally but not everyone was equal in Sumerian society there was a clear hierarchy with the King priests and officials at the top followed by regular citizens like Farmers Artisans and Traders then came the slaves mostly captured in wars or forced into servitude due to debt religion played a central role in Sumerian life with each City worshiping its own Patron God believed to protect and bring Prosperity these Gods lived in Grand temples which were not just places of worship but also economic hubs and storehouses the zigurat a massive stepped pyramid was a distinctive feature serving as the Temple's home and a central point for religious activities we talked about the rise of Sumerian city states and how they functioned but let's zoom in and explore some of the most famous Myan cities Uruk is like the OG of cities often considered the world's first true City it was a hot bed of innovation and power imagine massive ziggurats like the Anu zigurat and the white temple pretty impressive for a civilization that thrived thousands of years ago Uruk also gets major props for inventing uniform writing forever changing how humans communicated another big name is er this city state was famous for its towering zigurat of ER a testament to their Devotion to the Moon god Nana but Ur wasn't just about religion it was also a bustling hub for trade and military power archaeological evidence shows they were wealthy and artistically skilled eridu claims the title of one of the oldest Sumerian cities steeped in religious significance it was dedicated to enki the god of water knowledge and creation think of it as a major Center for early religious practices as evidenced by the archaeological finds Unearthed there lagash wasn't just another pretty face it was known for its artistic and Architectural contributions this city wielded significant religious and political influence leaving behind a treasure Trove of archaeological evidence including sculptures and inscriptions that offer a glimpse into Sumerian culture so these are just a few examples of the vibrant and diverse city states that formed the backbone of Sumerian civilization each City had its own unique character and contributions making them an enduring part of human history imagine a world without writing now imagine the Revolutionary moment when humans first captured their thoughts and stories on a permanent medium that's exactly what the Sumerians achieved around 3,400 BCE with the invention of uniform writing it all started with simple pictures think emojis but for ancient Mesopotamia these pictographs were used on Clay tokens to keep track of things like goods and livestock but over time these pictures evolved they became more stylized and eventually transformed into the wedge-shaped symbols we know as cuniform while invented by the Sumerians it was later adapted by other cultures like the ardians Babylonians and even the Hittites proving its versatility across languages so what did people write about with this fancy new writing system well everything from everyday business to Epic Tales uniform tablets were used to record economic transactions track taxes and inventories and and even document the sale of land and livestock they were basically the spreadsheets and receipts of the ancient world but cuniform wasn't just about numbers and practicalities it was also a powerful tool for storytelling the Epic of Gilgamesh a Timeless Masterpiece exploring themes of friendship heroism and mortality is just one example of the rich literary tradition preserved in cuniform poets and himym writers also used this script to create beautiful Works dedicated to their gods and goddesses offering us a window into their religious beliefs and practices couni form even played a crucial role in law and order the code of hamurabi one of the earliest and most complete written legal codes in history was inscribed in cuni form this code established laws governing everything from contracts and property rights to personal conduct providing a glimpse into the complexities of Babylonian Society legal disputes and their resolutions were also documented in uniform tablets shedding light on the legal processes of the time and let's not forget religion mythological stories epic tales and even instructions for religious rituals were all meticulously recorded in cuniform these texts not only reveal the fascinating mythology of these ancient civilizations but also highlight the Deep connection between religion and daily life in Mesopotamia Beyond writing and City Life the Sumerians were also total brainiacs making significant contributions to astronomy math and agric culture these weren't just random discoveries they had a lasting impact that continues to shape our world today let's start with the Stars the Sumerians were among the first to develop a Luna calendar keeping track of time based on the moon's Cycles this calendar helped them plan their farming religious festivals and even their daily routines think of it as an ancient to-do list synced to the Moon their calendar had 12 months but they weren't afraid to add an extra one every now and then to stay in sync with the seasons the Sumerians were also math wizzes inventing the sexagesimal system which is basically a fancy way of saying they used Bas 60 instead of our usual base 10 this system might seem strange at first but it actually had advantages especially for complex calculations it's the reason we have 60 minutes in an hour and 360\u00b0 in a circle both remnants of this ingenious Sumerian invention fractions and advanced astronomical calculations also benefited from this system speaking of astronomy the Sumerians were stargazers extraordinaire they meticulously recorded their observations of the night sky mapping out constellations planets and even individual Stars this Celestial mapping wasn't just for fun it helped them navigate keep track of time and even understand the universe around them influencing their religious beliefs and practices some historians even believe the ziggurats those massive Temple structures served as giant observatories imagine priests using these high platforms to chart the movements of planets and stars determining the best times to plant and harvest crops now things get a bit more controversial there's a guy named Zechariah sitchin who had some interesting but ultimately unproven ideas about the Sumerians and their epic poem The enuma Elish sitchin believed that Nibiru a planet mentioned in the poem wasn't just a symbolic thing but a real giant planet in our solar system with a super long orbit like 3,600 years long based on his interpretation of ancient texts and artwork he thought this planet's movements might explained some Cosmic events described in the enuma Elish he also argued that the Sumerians had way more advanced knowledge of the cosmos than we previously thought thanks to some helpful extraterrestrial visitors from Nibiru called the anunaki sitchin believed these weren't just Gods but actual beings who came to Earth looking for gold and ended up genetically engineering early humans to be their workers this genetic manipulation according to sitchin explains the rapid development of Sumerian civilization with its fancy writing impressive architecture and organized government it was the view very firm view of archaeologist that there had been no megalithic architecture and when I say megalithic I mean literally big stones stone circles huge constructions nothing like that before 6,000 years ago Central to my work was the notion of a global cataclysm roughly 12,500 12,800 years ago they are not saying that it also wiped out a lost Advanced civilization of prehistory I'm saying that in the heart of lebanon's Bear Valley lies an ancient wonder that defies the sands of time the balbec temple complex this is balbec uh in the Lebanon each of these three blocks weighs 900 tons home to some of the largest and most mysterious stone blocks ever used in construction these colossal remnants of the Roman Empire's grander weigh as much as 1,650 tons each more than an entire fleet of blue whales how these Stones were transported and precisely set into place remains one of history's most captivating puzzles I don't know how they did it all I know is they did it I don't think anybody knows how they did it how they lifted those stones how they brought them up to that level join us as we delve into the enigmatic world of balbec where ancient engineering meets modern curiosity challenging everything we thought we knew about human Ingenuity a Roman site for sure but what about this bizarre enclosure wall that surrounds it nestled in the fertile Bear Valley of Lebanon the ancient site of balbec is a testament to architectural and cultural Grandeur spanning thousands of years known as heliopolis During the helenistic period Bal Beck's Journey began as a a modest Phoenician town named Bala dedicated to the worship of Bal a god associated with the sun and storms pivotal to the agricultural rituals of its people the transformation of balbec accelerated following its conquest by Alexander the Great in 334 BC under Alexander the city absorbed Greek cultural and Architectural elements emblematic of his broader strategy to fuse Greek and local Traditions across the regions he conquered this helenistic influence set the stage for Bal Beck's later architectural Evolution under the Romans who saw the city's strategic and religious potential what archaeologists say they found they could move 900 ton blocks but 1,000 tons was too much for them Roman Architects and Engineers embarked on an ambitious construction agenda in the first century BC which saw balbec grow into a grand ceremonial Center the centerpiece was the Temple of Jupiter one of the largest temples in the Roman Empire featuring 54 massive Granite columns each standing 70 ft tall today only six of these Majestic columns remain but they continue to dominate the landscape offering a window into what was an architectural Marvel of the ancient world nearby the Temple of baka stands as a testament to Roman decorative art and Architectural detail with its well-preserved carvings depicting mythological scenes and festivities not far from these the Temple of Venus showcases a unique circular design breaking from traditional Roman architectural norms and highlighting a syncretic blend of Roman and local religious practices Bal Beck's construction Feats especially the transportation and placement of massive Limestone blocks draw parallels with other ancient Marvels like the Egyptian pyramids and Stonehenge showcasing the Romans Advanced engineering techniques look at the famous King's chamber its walls and the ceiling of the king's chamber are all made with gigantic blocks the site was not just an architectural statement but also a cultural Hub attracting pilgrims and Spectators from across the Empire to its religious festivals and games blending Roman and local traditions in Grand displays of public celebration in comparison to other Monumental Roman sites like the pantheon in Rome balbec stands out for its scale and the complexity involved in erecting such gigantic structures far from the Roman Heartland the pantheon with its massive Dome and Oculus reflects similar Ambitions in Roman architectural prowess but in a vastly different Urban setting both sites however illustrate the Roman Empire's architectural ambition and its ability to mobilize resources and Technology across its vast territories the stone blocks of balbec particularly within the Temple of Jupiter complex represent some of the most astonishing elements of ancient architecture found anywhere in the world these massive Stones serve as a testament to the extraordinary engineering prowess of their Builders their construction techniques and capabilities continue to spark both fascination and scholarly debate at the heart of the complex sits the trilithon a trio of stone blocks that form the podium of the Temple of Jupiter each Stone measures roughly 64 ft in length 13 ft in height and 14 ft in width and weighs about 800 tons the Precision with which these gigantic stones are fitted together without any mortar is truly remarkable such an engineering feat required not only Advanced planning and ample resources but also the ingenious use of simple machines like levers and inclined planes combined with significant human and mechanical effort just about 900 M from the main Temple complex in a nearby Quarry lies the stone of the pregnant woman the Quarry contains a number of very large blocks that were never transported this monolith approximately 69 ft long and weighing around 1,000 tons has never been moved from where it was originally cut the Stone's name comes from a local Legend suggesting that touching the stone can ensure a safe and easy delivery for pregnant women highlighting the cultural and superstitious significance these ancient Stones hold within local folklore in 2014 an even larger Stone was Unearthed in the same Quarry why only recently excavated because the whole site was covered in sedimentation at 64 ft in length and estimated to weigh about 1,650 tons it stands as the largest known Stone ever carved by human hands this discovery significantly expanded our understanding of the capabilities of ancient engineers and their technological advancements comparing these megalithic stones to other Ancient Wonders provides further context to their impressive nature for instance while Stonehenge in England is renowned for its circular arrangement of Standing Stones the largest of these Stones weighs merely about 30 tons far less than the massive blocks of balbec the construction of Stonehenge involved transporting Stones over long distances presenting a different type of logistical Challenge and Ingenuity however the sheer scale and weight of the Balck Stones showcase an unparalleled architectural ambition in the ancient world similarly when we consider the Egyptian pyramids particularly the Great Pyramid of Giza the Limestone blocks typically weigh between 2 to 15 Tons with the largest Granite stones in the king's chamber weighing between 25 to 80 tons now egyptologist will tell you that oh they could move heavy blocks because they put them on wet sand and they pushed them along on wet sand maybe if you're just at ground level that will do but when you're 350 ft above the ground as you are in the king's chamber that won't do at all the stones of balbec far exceed these in size highlighting the unique challenges and skills required for their transport and placement unlike the primarily tomlike structures of the Giza Pyramids bal's temples served ceremonial and religious functions indicating diverse uses of massive Stones across ancient civilizations this comparison not only illustrates the Monumental scale of Bal Beck's construction but also underscores the diverse architectural and cultural expressions of ancient societies the balbec temple complex with its colossal stone blocks stands as one of the greatest engineering achievements of the ancient world the tasks involved in constructing this Monumental site weren't just about brute strength they required meticulous planning Advanced organizational skills and a deep understanding of physics and engineering principles these elements combined challenge our modern perceptions of ancient technology and showcase the Ingenuity of our ancestors the architectural Grandeur of balbec was no accident it reflected the Roman Empire's immense ambition and its desire to display power and divine favor the sheer scale of the temple served multiple purposes both religious and political reinforcing the might of Rome and the sanctity of the location this complex was designed to awe and affirm the presence of Roman Authority in the region the transportation of the massive Stones is believed to have been primarily conducted using rollers made from large tree trunks with the stones themselves placed on sledges these sledges acting as platforms helped distribute the weight of the stones and prevented the rollers from sinking into the ground historical texts even mention the use of olive oil as a lubricant on the paths a technique that significantly reduced friction making it easier to move these enormous weights over considerable distances the placement of these giant Stones remains a subject of debate among historians techniques such as the use of wooden cranes which were similar to those used in medieval constructions likely played a role these cranes utilizing ropes pulleys and possibly tread Wheels would have Amplified the force exerted by humans or animals another plausible technique involved constructing large Earth ramps which would have provided a gradual incline to drag the stones into their precise positions lever systems employing long wooden beams to lift and position Stones might have also been used requiring less material than ramps but a greater understanding of Leverage mechanics drawing parallels the construction techniques theorized for balbec closely resemble those hypothesized for the building of the Egyptian pyramids particularly the Pyramid of Giza like balbec the transportation of the pyramid Stones likely involves sledges and possibly rollers with the use of water as a lubricant depicted in ancient Egyptian wall paintings for lifting the Egyptians are believed to have utilized a combination of ramps and lever systems constructed over a millennium before balbec the pyramids highlight a continuity in complex engineering techniques that span cultures and ages underscoring a shared architectural Heritage in the ancient world this shared Legacy speaks volumes about the Ingenuity embedded in ancient construction practices linking disperate cultures through their Monumental achievements very little is left of the ancient North American [Music] monuments more than 90% of the structures that were documented in the 19th century are now completely gone and of the less than 10% that remain the ma majority have been vandalized and destroyed discovering the ancient Maya civilization has been like piecing together a giant fascinating puzzle picture this back in the 16th century Spanish explorers led by folks like Hanan Cortez stumbled upon the remnants of a once glorious civilization with towering cities now reclaimed by the jungle oh the tragedy of the American North American [Music] pyramids there was once more than a million of them only 100,000 are left now sadly their initial encounters weren't the most respectful a lot of Maya history got lost or destroyed thanks to biases and a general lack of understanding the horrendous catastrophe of the Spanish Conquest the Spanish sent ahead of them terrible diseases like small pox fast forward to the 19th century and there's a renewed Buzz about the meire this time its explorers and adventurers trekking through the jungles of Central America and the Yucatan Peninsula hungry for knowledge about these ancient peoples two guys John Lloyd Stevens and Frederick catherwood became the rock stars of Maya exploration in the 1830s and 1840s they journeyed to sites like Copan and penquin sketching and writing about their finds their work lit up the world's imagination with tales and visuals of the Meers Grand City and sophisticated Culture by the 20th century studying the meire had become a serious scientific Endeavor archaeologists got down and dirty in the ruins conducting careful digs and uncovering secrets that the Maya Left Behind big projects at places like Copan and chichin itsa peeled back layers of mystery revealing intricate details about how the Maya lived worshiped and governed themselves if you have a relatively short time frame uh to deal with then searching for A Lost Civilization becomes much more complex and much more difficult discoveries at takal and pelen gave us Peaks into Royal life with their elaborate tombs and stunning artwork not to mention proof of the Meyer's knack for architecture and stargazing the lost city of El Mirador hidden for centuries beneath the dense canopy of Northern Guatemala's jungle stands as a Monumental witness to the ancient Maya civilization's Grandeur and Ingenuity rediscovered in the late 20th century this city has profoundly reshaped our understanding of the Maya pushing back the timeline of their architectural and societal achievements to much earlier than previously recognized flourishing from the 6th Century BCE alador was a preeminent City in the Maya World During the preclassic period centuries before the rise of the more commonly known classical Maya cities such as takal and Palenque its scale and complexity are astonishing with sprawling Urban centers elaborate plazas and sophisticated Water Management Systems including reservoirs and canals that supported a densely populated area at its Zenith the centerpiece of elidor is the Colossal ladant pyramid towering above the forest ladant is not just the largest pyramid in the Maya world but also one of the most massive ancient structures in the world by volume the pyramid's base covers an area larger than nine football fields and it rises to a height of approximately 230 ft constructing ladant would have required moving millions of cubic meters of Earth and stone a staggering feat given the absence of metal tools the wheel or domesticated beasts of Burden this Monumental effort underscores the advanced engineering skills and social organization of the Maya capable of mobilizing and sustaining such a large Workforce elor's Discovery also brought to light an extensive network of raised causeways known as sack Bob connecting it with other cities and settlements across the region these causeways facilitated trade movement and possibly acted as political and ceremonial Pathways illustrating the city's importance as a regional Hub one of the most intriguing theories about El Mirador and the preclassic Maya in general concerns the reasons for the city's Decline and eventual abandonment around the end of the first millennium BCE researchers speculate that extensive deforestation and the demands of large-scale Agriculture may have led to environmental degradation reducing the city's ability to support its population this Theory suggests a cautionary tale about the sustainability of human environment interactions echoing modern concerns about Environmental Management and conservation comparatively elidor and its Monumental architecture can be paralleled with ancient Egypt's Old Kingdom which was contemporaneously constructing its own colossal structures including the Pyramids of Giza both civilizations achieved remarkable architectural Feats without the advantages of modern technology relying instead on a profound understanding of engineering ing astronomy and Mathematics however whereas Egypt's pyramids serve primarily as tombs for Pharaohs Maya pyramids like Lanta were multifunctional serving as temples and possibly observatories reflecting the Maya's integrated approach to religion governance and science the decipherment of the Maya script stands as one of the most enthralling detective stories in the history of archaeology and Linguistics for centuries the intricate High glyphs carved into stone monuments painted on pottery and written in the few surviving bark paper books remained a locked Treasure Trove of the Ancient Maya civilization wisdom the Breakthrough in the 20th century primarily attributed to the insights of Russian linguist yuriar roov transformed our understanding of the Maya unveiling a civilization rich in history culture and scientific knowledge the Maya script is a complex system of glyphs which had stumped Scholars for years early attempts at decipherment were hampered by the assumption that the script was purely idiographic representing ideas rather than sounds much like the Egyptian hieroglyphs before their decipherment this led to numerous speculative and often incorrect interpretations of mea texts the Turning Point came in the 1950s With Yuri nor roof he proposed that the glyphs were not only logographic but also phonetic representing sounds kof's Insight was based on the use of the Lander alphabet a set of glyphs recorded by Spanish Bishop Diego danda which had been dismissed by many as inaccurate korov suggested that these glyphs could represent phonetic sounds as well as logographic symbols this approach opened the door to reading the Maya script as a fully functional writing system that included phonetic elements roof's work sparked a new wave of interest and research leading to a collaborative International effort to crack the Maya Code Scholars such as David Kelly Tatiana prorak COV and later Linda sheller and David Stewart among others made significant contributions prcu akov in particular was instrumental in demonstrating that many inscriptions were historical records of Meer rulers and their deeds rather than purely mythological texts as previously thought this shifted the direction of Maya epigraphy towards historical reconstruction one fascinating theory that has emerged from the study of Maya texts is the advanced nature of Maya astronomy and Mathematics the desert of the dresen Codex one of the surviving Maya books revealed complex tables for predicting lunar and solar eclipses the movements of the planet Venus and the cycles of the Maya calendar at the heart of their AST astronomical studies was the observatory at Chichen itsa known as the Caracol this structure with its distinctive round Dome and strategically placed openings served as a window to the heavens allowing Meer astronomers to accurately track the movements of Venus the Sun and other significant Celestial entities the precise alignment of the Caraco windows with these celestial bodies appearances and disappearances throughout the year under underscores the Myers's Advanced architectural skills and their capacity to harmonize their construction efforts with their extensive knowledge of astronomy this integration of astronomy into various aspects of Maya life highlights a civilization that valued the Stars not merely as subjects of curiosity but as essential guides for Earthly Endeavors the Mayers Legacy in astronomy evidenced by their codices observatories and calendars offers a glimpse into a societ iy that found Harmony in the cosmic order and sought to align its terrestrial activities with the celestial Rhythm it's a tale not too dissimilar to the story of the Rosetta Stone and the Egyptian hieroglyphs but with a Twist you see the Rosetta Stone was like getting the cheat codes to understand Egyptian hieroglyphs because it had translations right there but with the mea there wasn't a neat bilingual text lying around instead figuring out what those intricate carvings and paintings meant required a mix mix of smart guessing deep cultural Dives and a bit of detective work in understanding the symbols not just as pictures but as a complex blend of sounds and meanings now imagine trying to understand a writing system that's not only about what things are but also how they sound and that's what the Maya script is all about it's this incredible collection of over 800 different glyphs making it one of the shest most elaborate scripts you could lay your eyes on and the coolest part we're still unlocking the secrets of this ancient script the Maya script's ongoing dfer is a reminder that history isn't just about looking back it's a story that keeps evolving as we learn more above the king's chamber in the Great Pyramid are five further Chambers I think the problem is that archaeology doesn't allow that Monument to speak for itself it is very hard for archaeologists to explain how that was done the largest pyramids around the world are remarkable Feats of engineering and architecture embodying the technological advancements of their respective civilizations nestled in the region of Puebla Mexico before the Spanish Conquest a Monumental structure was erected that remains an a inspiring Testament to the Ingenuity and spirituality of the ancient cultures of meso America known as the Great Pyramid of chalula translating to to made by hand mountain in nahat this pyramid stands as the world's largest by volume with an astonishing volume of approximately 4.45 million cubic M it's not only the biggest pyramid globally but also the largest monument ever constructed by any civilization ancient or modern constructed from the 3rd Century BC through the 9th century ad it served as a multifaceted Center of worship and Community unlike the Egyptian pyramids which primarily served as tombs for the Pharaohs the Great Pyramid of chalula was dedicated to the worship of quel koatal a major deity associated with the wind air and learning the architectural Marvel of the pyramid with its base measuring 450x 450 M and reaching a height of 66 M remains mostly hidden under a layer of Earth and vegetation resembling more a natural hill than a man-made structure this appearance results from centuries of neglect and intentional covering by subsequent cultures making the pyramid a series of platforms built on top of one another over several Generations this contributed to its immense volume and sprawling base making it a palimpsest of the diverse cultures including the Oma shanka and others that left their mark on this ancient site at top the pyramid stands the Church of Our Lady of the remedies a symbol of the Spanish conquest and the forced christianization of the indigenous population constructed in the 16th century this church represents the visual and symbolic Fusion of prehispanic and Spanish Colonial periods in Mexico placed strategically to assert the dominance of Christianity over the Pagan religions an intriguing theory about the pyramid's construction suggests that it was intended to mimic the surrounding mountains creating a man-made version that could be seen as the center of the universe or a point of communication between the Divine and the Earthly this is supported by its nickname and its orientation which aligns with the cardinal points and significant celestial events hinting at a deep astronomical knowledge and spiritual significance when compared to the Great Pyramid of Giza in Egypt which is often celebrated for its precision and scale the Great Pyramid of Kula surpasses it in volume and the length of time over which it was constructed within the ancient city of toot wakan Mexico the Pyramid of the sun stands as a testament to the astonishing architectural capabilities and profound astronomical knowledge of its Builders this Majestic structure erected around 200 CE is not only the crowning Jewel of the the chot hakan complex but also ranks among the largest pyramids in miso America its creation achieved without the modern conveniences of metal tools wheels or animal labor showcases the extraordinary dedication and advanced engineering skills of the toota huacan people with a staggering volume of about 1.2 million cubic M and soaring to a height of 65 M the pyramid's scale is nothing short sort of or inspiring its base sprouls over more than 10 acres a space filled with approximately 3 million tons of stone meticulously placed by countless hands the Pyramid of the sun was far more than an architectural Marvel it was a Nexus of cultural and religious significance in one of the largest cities of the ancient world bakan at its Zenith was a bustling Metropolis of over 100,000 inhabitants and the pyramid likely served as a sacred site dedicated to a deity possibly the sun god this dedication speaks volumes about the city's cosmology and the pyramid's role not only as a ceremonial Center but also as a possible ferary space one of the most captivating aspects of the Pyramid of the sun is its astronomical alignment researchers have theorized that the pyramid along with other structures within the city was deliberately aligned with the movements of celestial bodies particularly the sun such precise orientation and dimensions of the pyramid may have been designed to Mark significant solar events like equinoxes and solstices integral to the Toyota huahan calendar this deep understanding of astronomy and its integration into the city's architecture and urban layout underscore the advanced knowledge of the ancient mesoamericans when we draw comparisons between the Pyramid of the sun and the Great Pyramid of kufu in Giza Egypt we find intriguing contrasts and similarities although the Pyramid of kufu stands taller the Pyramid of the sun impresses with its broader base and substantial volume reflecting different architectural Ambitions and technological approaches while the Egyptian pyramid served as a Monumental tomb emphasizing the afterlife the Pyramid of the sun was more aligned with Celestial worship and communal rituals reflect in the broader cultural and religious landscape of ancient meso America yet both structures manifest the universal human aspiration to connect with the Divine whether in the veneration of gods or in the commemoration of monarchs further excavations have unveiled a network of caves and tunnels beneath the Pyramid of the sun likely holding ceremonial significance and possibly representing the underworld in tootak Khan's cosmology the pyramid's construction technique featuring The talod tablero architectural style became a Hallmark of toote hakan and was replicated across meso America moreover the city's layout with the Pyramid of the Sun at its heart was meticulously planned to align with the cardinal directions adding another layer to its astronomical and cosmological importance moving on to the Great Pyramid of Giza a Masterpiece that has stood the test of time remains one of the most magnificent and mysterious achievements of ancient Egypt constructed during the reign of pharaoh kufu around 2580 to 2560 BC this pyramid not only serves as a testament to ancient Egyptian Grandeur and Engineering prowess but also continues to be a source of Fascination for historians Architects and travelers from all corners of the globe originally soaring to a height of 140 M it's slightly shorter now at about 138.0 M mainly due to the loss of its outer casing stones and Capstone nevertheless it held the title of the tallest man-made structure in the world for over 3,800 years a record that speaks volumes about the skill and ambition of its creators what's truly remarkable about the Great Pyramid is the sheer scale of its construction its base covers an area of 13 acres with each side measuring 756 ft and it was built using approximately 2.3 million blocks of limestone and granite these blocks Weighing on average 2 and 1/2 tons and some as Hefty as 80 tons were Precision cut and transported from distant quaries a feat of logistics and craftsmanship that remains or inspiring even today the Precision in the pyramid's construction is almost unparalleled The Base is almost perfectly square and its alignment with the cardinal points of the compass is extraordinarily accurate inside the pyramid houses three main Chambers the king's chamber the Queen's chamber and the Subterranean chamber connected by narrow passages the grand Gallery leading to the king's chamber is particularly striking with its core beld roof architecture reaching up to a height of about 28 ft one of the more intriguing theories about the Great Pyramid is the Orion correlation theory proposed by Robert boval in the 1980s this Theory posits that the layout of the three main Giza Pyramids mirrors the alignment of the three stars in Orion's Belt this Celestial mapping with the constellation Orion associated with Osiris the god of the afterlife suggests a profound cosmological and spiritual Dimension to the pyramid's design highlighting the an ancient Egyptians deep connection to the cosmos and the afterlife drawing a comparison between the Great Pyramid and the Coliseum in Rome offers an interesting perspective on the architectural achievements of ancient civilizations built nearly 2,000 years apart these structures represent the Pinnacle of their respective society's architectural and cultural aspirations the Coliseum a Marvel of Roman engineering was designed as a venue for public entertainment capable of seating tens of thousands of Spectators in contrast the Great Pyramid with its focus on architectural Precision spiritual beliefs and the significance of the afterlife exemplifies the ancient Egyptians engineering genius and spiritual depth despite their different purposes both structures stand as enduring monuments to human Ingenuity and the architectural Legacy of their creators among the many fascinating aspects of of the Great Pyramid are the casing stones that once covered it made of polished white Tura Limestone that would have made the pyramid gleam in the sunlight the temperature inside the pyramid remains a constant 20\u00b0 C mirroring the Earth's average temperature Additionally the pyramid was originally surrounded by a massive wall known as the wall of the Crowe remnants of which still exist today the techniques used in the construction of the pyramid especially the method of lifting and placing the stones continue to be a subject of lively debate and fascination with its complex cosmology architectural Brilliance and enduring mystery the Great Pyramid of Giza continues to inspire and Captivate embodying the rich Legacy of ancient Egyptian civilization it's a whole set of ratios and proportions embedded in creation itself so it looks like they were using a unit of measurement that was a sub multiple of a mile is that a coincidence no imagine stepping back in time all the way back to 3000 bcee when the landscape of Wiltshire England began to change in a way that would capture the imagination of humanity for Millennia this was the start of what we now know as Stonehenge a monument that has puzzled historians archaeologists and tourists alike its construction spanned over several Millennia transitioning through the Neolithic into the Bronze Age a period marked by profound social and technological Transformations the most iconic phase of stonehenge's construction kicked off around 2,600 BCE and lasted until 1600 BCE this era saw the erection of the stone circles that have become synonymous with mystery and ancient Ingenuity but what if there's more to Stonehenge than meets the eye sure its astronomical alignments are impressive but could these be Clues pointing to a function far beyond our current understanding in some speculate that Stonehenge might have served as an early warning system for asteroids given its precise alignments with celestial events let's delve into the monument itself stonehenge's architecture is a Marvel of ancient engineering comprising two main types of stones the Hefty Sasson and the slightly less imposing blue stones the Sasson giant Sandstone blocks weighing as much as 25 tons were sourced from malor Downs about 20 mi away on on the other hand the blue stones which still weigh up to 4 tons present a bit more of a mystery believed to have been transported over 150 mi from the prelli hills in Wales their journey to stonehenge's site speaks volumes about The Monument's significance to its Builders it suggests a level of organization Manpower and technological innovation that we're only beginning to fully appreciate the construction techniques employed are nothing short of remarkable imagine shaping these massive stones with nothing more than tools made from deer antlers wooden mallets and ropes the larger sarson Stones were carefully arranged in a post and lenal structure using mortis and Tenon joints for added stability this method wasn't just about ensuring The Monument's durability it was also about achieving aesthetic harmony with the surrounding landscape it showcases an advanced grasp of engineering principles that challenges our modern perceptions of ancient civilizations so as we Marvel at the enduring Legacy of Stonehenge the question remains was it simply a feat of engineering and a place of gathering or did it serve a higher perhaps even Cosmic purpose the astronomical Precision of its layout hints at a deeper connection with the cosmos perhaps even serving as a sentinel against Celestial threats delving into the past of Stonehenge we uncover a timeline of Discovery and insight that stretches from the curious minds of the 17th century to the advanced technological investigations of today the Journey Begins with John Aubrey an antiquarian who in the 17th century embarked on some of the first systematic studies of this enigmatic site identifying what came to be known as the Aubry holes circular pits surrounding the monument fast forward to the 20th century and the Baton was passed to Pioneers like William gowland and later the collaborative efforts of Richard Atkinson Stuart pigot and John FS Stone their extensive excavations peeled back layers of time offering a glimp into the construction techniques and chronological layers that have shaped our current understanding of Stonehenge but it's the recent findings that have truly revolutionized our comprehension of this prehistoric Marvel with the Advent of modern techniques such as radiocarbon dating ground penetrating radar and DNA analysis the curtain has been pulled back to reveal the people who built Stonehenge and the society they inhabited analysis of human remains Unearthed at the site indicates that some individ uals might have traveled from as far away as Wales suggesting a network of connections that spanned across regions moreover the Stonehenge hidden Landscapes project has unveiled a broader ceremonial landscape revealing that Stonehenge is but one part of a vast complex of monuments including burial mounds and additional henges the mystery deepens with the discovery of the blue stone quaries in Wales pinpointed as the source of The Monument's smaller Stones the uncovering of preist stone tools at these quaries sheds light on the Monumental effort involved in their extraction and transportation painting a picture of a society capable of remarkable Feats the Intrigue of Stonehenge isn't limited to its Origins and construction its astronomical alignments are equally captivating suggesting a profound understanding of the cosmos among its Builders The Monument's alignment with the solstices is particularly striking on the summer solstice the sun rises in perfect harmony with the heelstone casting a shadow that stretches to The Monument's heart this alignment is not merely coincidental but suggests a deliberate architectural intent to Mark the sun's cyclical Journey serving purposes that might have ranged from the religious to the agricultural or even as a prehistoric timekeeping device but the celestial connections don't end with the sun Stonehenge also boasts complex lunar alignments believed to correspond with the moon's Extreme Rising and setting positions during its major and minor standstills a cycle known as the matonic cycle among the many theories proposed about its purpose one particularly intriguing idea is the asteroid detection hypothesis this speculative Theory suggests that the ancient architects of Stonehenge possessed an advanced understanding of the cosmos enabling them to track and predict celestial events including potentially hazardous asteroids while not widely embraced in the academic Community this Theory underscores the belief that stonehenge's Builders were far more sophisticated in their astronomical knowledge than often recognized perhaps monitoring the skies for signs of impending Danger from above equally fascinating is the theory that Stonehenge served as a healing Sanctuary archaeological discoveries of numerous human remains near the site many showing signs of illness or injury support this notion the blue stones integral to the monument structure are reputed to have healing properties suggesting Stonehenge was a place of pilgrimage for those seeking physical and spiritual healing across prehistoric Europe this idea paints Stonehenge not just as a monument of astronomical significance but as a center of immense cultural and spiritual importance where ancient people sought Solace and renewal another captivating theory proposes Stonehenge as a portal to the ancestors a sacred site where the living could connect with the dead or Divine entities supported by the burial of human remains dating back to The Monument's earliest phases this theory is further enriched Ed by stonehenge's precise alignments with celestial events particularly the solstices these alignments may have symbolized the Eternal cycles of Life Death and rebirth with Stonehenge acting as a bridge between the Earthly and the Ethereal exploring comparisons with other ancient monuments offers additional insights into stonehenge's significance new gra in County meth Ireland shares stonehenge's fascination with astronomical phenomena with its main passage aligned to catch the winter solstice Sunrise though differing in construction stonehenge's open air circles contrast with new gr's covered passage and chamber both sites demonstrate a deep engagement with the movements of the sun reflecting a widespread prehistoric concern with Celestial Cycles another comparison with the Pyramids of Giza in Egypt further highlights the diversity of ancient engineering and astronomical understanding both Stonehenge and the pyramids are aligned with astonishing Precision to astronomical phenomena yet they serve different purposes and employed different construction techniques stonehenge's alignment with the solstices might have functioned as a prehistoric calendar while the pyramid's orientation towards the cardinal points and specific Stars speaks to their own unique cosmological significance Randall Carlson takes us on a fascinating Journey Through the lens of sacred geometry and ancient wisdom revealing how some of the world's most iconic structures are not merely Feats of architectural Brilliance but also vast repositories of complex mathematical astronomical and metaphysical knowledge his exploration suggests that the Ancients had a grasp of the cosmos and the fundamental principles of reality that goes far beyond what we often give them credit for this idea nudges us towards rethinking the old knowledge and pondering its relevance in today's scientific and philosophical Realms take for example the Great Pyramid of Giza it's not just a wonder of the ancient world for its sheer size and durability but also for how it EMB embes the principles of sacred geometry Carlson points out that the pyramid might encode significant mathematical constants like pi and the golden ratio essential for understanding circular geometry and the Aesthetics of proportion respectively the notion that the pyramids Dimensions could reflect such profound mathematical Concepts suggests an architectural aim intertwined with deep symbolic meaning possibly mirroring the ancient Egyptians Cosmic understanding and their view of the universe's order but the Great Pyramid is just the starting point Carlson Dives deeper suggesting that ancient constructions were intentionally designed to convey wisdom about the cosmos and the Very structure of reality the alignment of many ancient structures with celestial bodies the harmonic principles reflected in their dimensions and the metaphysical insights they offer all hint at a sophisticated ancient understanding of numerical relationships and their resonance with the cosmos these structures could thus be seen as keys to unlocking the mysteries of reality embodying a worldview that perceived the universe as an interconnected whole governed by geometric and mathematical laws one of the most intriguing aspects of Carlson's theory is the idea of a global grid of sacred sites connected through energy lines or lay lines this concept extends beyond the Great Pyramid to include other Monumental sites like Stonehenge Machu Picchu and the Nazca Lines according to this Theory these sites were not randomly chosen but strategically placed to tap into the Earth's natural energies for Spiritual healing or knowledge enhancing purposes this Global Network suggests a sophisticated perhaps even Universal understanding of Earth's energies and their importance to human consciousness and civilization an understanding that may have been deliberately concealed or lost over Millennia through Carlson's eyes we're invited to look at ancient structures not just as relics of the past but as beacons of a Lost Wisdom that understood the Deep connections between geometry astronomy and the Very fabric of reality his theories encourage us to reconsider the Ancients capabilities and the profound knowledge that may have been encoded in the Monumental legacies they left behind [Music] [Applause] "
