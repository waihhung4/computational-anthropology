"History\u2019s first empire rose \nout of a hot, dry landscape, without rainfall to nourish crops, \nwithout trees or stones for building. In spite of all this, its inhabitants\nbuilt the world\u2019s first cities, with monumental architecture \nand large populations\u2014 and they built them \nentirely out of mud. Sumer occupied the southern part \nof modern Iraq in the region called Mesopotamia. Mesopotamia means \u201cbetween two rivers\u201d\u2014 the Tigris and the Euphrates. Around 5000 BCE, early Sumerians used\nirrigation channels, dams, and reservoirs to redirect river water and farm \nlarge areas of previously bone-dry land. Agricultural communities like this \nwere slowly springing up around the world. But Sumerians were the first\nto take the next step. Using clay bricks made from river mud, they began to build multi-storied\nhomes and temples. They invented the wheel\u2014 a potter\u2019s wheel, for turning mud \ninto household goods and tools. Those clay bricks gave rise \nto the world\u2019s first cities, probably around 4500 BCE. At the top of the city\u2019s social ladder\nwere priests and priestesses, who were considered nobility, then merchants, craftspeople,\nfarmers, and enslaved people. The Sumerian empire \nconsisted of distinct city-states that operated like small nations. They were loosely linked \nby language and spiritual belief but lacked centralized control. The earliest cities were Uruk, \nUr, and Eridu, and eventually there were a dozen cities. Each had a king who served a role \nsomewhere between a priest and a ruler. Sometimes they fought against \neach other to conquer new territories. Each city was dedicated to a patron deity,\nconsidered the city\u2019s founder. The largest and most important building \nin the city was this patron god\u2019s home: the ziggurat, a temple designed\nas a stepped pyramid. Around 3200 BCE, Sumerians began \nto expand their reach. The potter\u2019s wheel found a new home \non chariots and wagons. They built boats out of reeds \nand date palm leaves, with linen sails that carried \nthem vast distances by river and sea. To supplement scarce resources, \nthey built a trade network with the rising kingdoms in Egypt, \nAnatolia, and Ethiopia, importing gold, silver, \nlapis lazuli, and cedar wood. Trade was the unlikely impetus for the invention \nof the world\u2019s first writing system. It started as a system of accounting\nfor Sumerian merchants conducting business with traders abroad. After a few hundred years, \nthe early pictogram system called cuneiform turned into a script. The Sumerians drafted up the first\nwritten laws and created the first school system, \ndesigned to teach the craft of writing\u2014 and pioneered some less exciting\ninnovations, like bureaucracy and taxes. In the schools, scribes studying \nfrom dawn to dusk, from childhood well into adulthood. They learned accounting, mathematics,\nand copied works of literature\u2014 hymns, myths, proverbs, animal fables, \nmagic spells, and the first epics on clay tablets. Some of those tablets told \nthe story of Gilgamesh, a king of the city of Uruk who was\nalso the subject of mythical tales. But by the third millennium BCE, Sumer\nwas no longer the only empire around, or even in Mesopotamia. Waves of nomadic tribes poured\ninto the region from the north and east. Some newcomers looked up to the Sumerians,\nadopting their way of life and using the cuneiform script \nto express their own languages. In 2300 BCE, the Akkadian king Sargon\nconquered the Sumerian city-states. But Sargon respected Sumerian culture, and Akkadians and Sumerians\nexisted side-by-side for centuries. Other invading groups focused \nonly on looting and destruction. Even as Sumerian culture spread, a steady onslaught of invasions killed\noff the Sumerian people by 1750 BCE. Afterward, Sumer disappeared \nback into the desert dirt, not to be rediscovered\nuntil the 19th century. But Sumerian culture lived \non for thousands of years\u2014 first through the Akkadians,\nthen the Assyrians, then the Babylonians. The Babylonians passed Sumerian \ninventions and traditions through along Hebrew, Greek, and Roman cultures. Some persist today. "
