"China is something that in the West even until as recently as the 1300s was more of a mystery to us until the Venetian by the name of Marco Polo decided he wanted to take an extended holiday and go and tour around Asia with the publication of his travels Europe got its first detailed description of Asia and the Far East but with that being said let's see if we can piece together the mysteries of China from the very beginning for today we start with the birth of civilization in what would one day become China today we begin with the gr dynasty of China good morning good afternoon good evening my fellow historians around the world and welcome back to our series on a history of humanity as part of the grand portfolio continuing with our theme of the first civilizations we're going today even further east in India and don't worry all of you Akkadian Empire and Mesopotamia enthusiasts we will be returning to that area of the world in due course but today we're going to start looking at China so far we know a little bit about Chinese culture but with my earlier videos on both new year and Chinese New Year go ahead and check those out if you haven't already we know of course how the Chinese zodiac came to be why Chinese New Year is celebrated on a different day every year and of course the traditions surrounding that time of the year for China for now however we return to the historical side of things so let me take you back it's roughly around the year 2100 BC for this is where the story of China's first dynasty the Shia dynasty truly begins now it is a little bit tricky this yard Indus T because myth and actual written history for ancient China at least tends to get a bit mixed up alas perhaps the only thing we have written down about this yard dynasty comes from the bamboo annals which unfortunately dips a little bit into the more legendary mythical and spectacular side of things makes for great media makes for great video games makes for great films and not so much for studying history god damn it can you please just keep the propaganda and myth separate from the written history for five seconds thank you God the other record of ancient Chinese history we have also is known as the records of the grand historian or as it's known in Mandarin shirty but if we're basing what we know of the Shiar dynasty of China on credible documents here we can't even use shirty because it was in fact written in 94 BC by the Han Dynasty official Sima Qian but I suppose in order to do some learning today we sort of have to throw credibility to the wind a bit and that's something I don't like to do very often so I am breaking my own rules a bit here but let's see how we go and see how far we get and see how much we learn this is gonna be a tricky one but just bear with me hopefully we will learn something today and clicking on this video was not a giant waste of your time okay let's not be pessimistic here so to begin with the Jia dynasty was established roughly around the Year 2070 BC so we're talking over 4,000 years ago this again is roughly the same time the Akkadian Empire came into existence and that the peoples at the Indus River Valley Civilization had their civilization and influence in full-swing like with the Akkadian Empire however in order to learn as much as possible about the Shia dynasty of China we need to go back to slightly before it was founded so our story begins according to what we have with the Yellow Emperor or as he is known quantity or Huangdi this Emperor emerged among his local tribes to rule the Shandong region between twenty six ninety seven and twenty 597 BC so roughly a century by this account Quan D the Yellow Emperor is said to be one of the three sovereigns of ancient China mythical demigod God kings who ruled over regions of China quindi for instance is accredited with the first production of silk the institution of law and customs the development of early medicine and agriculture to his local populace but even with this story we have to take it with a pinch of salt because as I just said one of the three sovereigns and were said to be basically like gods among men so there we go again with myth crossing into history well I try and we do what we can so let's continue Wandy is sets be succeeded by his grandson Joo young-soo who according to legend is said to be one of the five Emperor's the five founding fathers of the Shia dynasty of China one day however if you're interested he sits be buried in the mausoleum in the Wan Ling County of Shaanxi province in China but you're probably going to asked me oh but if he's a god how come he's dead and in a mausoleum please go and research it yourself my head is hurting enough already from researching all this well before my painkillers wear off I suppose I should go into more detail on how the Shia dynasty itself was founded according to legend the five Emperor's were said to have founded the dynasty of China after after defeating their rivals under the leadership of a ow yah was another of the five emperors and after leading his contemporaries to victory over their rivals yah was appointed to be the first emperor of the shi'ar dynasty however a common theme in history is that when a throne passes from one monarch or one Emperor to another they tend to inherit a whole bounty of problems that the previous monarch was unable to deal with before they passed the throne to their successor with Yao however he rather took leadership within gr but even for him when he took the throne he was faced with problems almost from the start you see the Yellow River in China is known for having violent floods which back in ancient times were a big big problem especially for societies and civilizations that relied heavily on agriculture as they did after the Neolithic Revolution these floods however with the Yellow River in particular were said to be so great so violent and so costly in terms of Agriculture crops and even lives lost which led to the river being given the eventual nickname China's sorrow with lives and crops being swept away by China's sorrow Yao was pressed to tame the river before it could do any more damage he appointed a man named goon to help stop the flooding and control the Yellow River goon tried to control the river by building dikes and dams to stop the severity of the flooding and contain the river however after nine years of trying nine years of dams and dikes collapsing gyoon had failed to stop the floods of the Yellow River by this time however cow had passed the throne of year to shun the last of the five Emperor's and shun displeased with goons attempt at trying to stop the flooding of the Yellow River dismissed him what happened to good after that is unknown some accounts say he took his own life in shame other states help the Emperor should imprisoned him for life others still however claim that goon spent the rest of his life in self-exile in the mountains that his fate is yet unknown with the issue of these catastrophic floods still looming large over here shun appointed goons son you to complete the work you however unlike his father was clever humble and resourceful instead of attempting to work against the forces of nature he instead used their destructive power and used the power and momentum of the river in order to control the floods instead of constructing dikes and dams to forcefully stop the water and stop nature's true path he instead ordered local tribes to dig canals to the sea to take the rivers excess flow it is said that during the 13 years it took to complete the task you never stopped to rest or return to his home whether this is true or immoral because this is all supposedly mythical we can't be sure as for the river however use strategy to dig canals to the sea to take the yellow rivers excess flow away from the lands paid off and so for stopping the floods and saving Ziya emperor shun may you a general physique for his efforts who then went on to defeat the problematic tribe known as the san miao an emperors shun as the ultimate recognition of you for his efforts in not only stopping the flooding of the Yellow River but also for defeating the san miao named him as the heir to the throne of xia for shun was the last of the five emperors and from what we know had no biological heirs to his throne thus you would be known forevermore as you the great with the problem of the yellow rivers violent and destructive floods now under control agricultural production within gia was said to have boomed and so as we've discussed in previous videos had an excess of crops and enough to feed and build an army and with an army as as its backbone Gia's power simply increased even more but as with the last of the five Emperor's shun you had to name a successor and instead of like his predecessor naming the most capable candidates after himself you instead passed the throne to his son Qi this would begin a key feature of Chinese monarchy Charice to come all the way up until the end of the Ching dynasty in the early 20th century it is said that originally you intended to name his minister as successor to the imperial throne because he did not wish for his son she to bear the great burden of ruling Jia however she had proven himself so popular with the common people that you in the end on his deathbed had no choice but to name his son as success to the throne because just as you're raising your foot to kick the bucket the last thing you want is an angry mob with pitchforks and torches trying to kick your door in because you named somebody his successor that they didn't want as for the reign of Qi little is known however it is known that she's successor his son ty Kang was criticized as quite a poor ruler and he Jones we could get any reasons behind this no ok another plot alright then so as for the rulers who came after Ty Kang we don't actually have any clear names except for the 4th ruler after ty Kang's death this new ruler Xiao Kang is said in gr legend to be a hero who after the chaos at the previous 4 to 5 rulers managed to revitalize re-stabilize and get the country back on track it's his rule among some of his later descendants that is attributed to the development of armor and the way of chivalry in battle however it seems the supply of capable leaders after Xiao Kang in Xie was far exceeded by the demand for them for instance Emperor Kong Jia who ruled this yard in SD between the years 1789 and 1758 BC wait wait wait a minute well those years well those dates oh my god we might have something concrete at last oh my god I can feel that dopamine going nuts upstairs whoa Oh at last we have something that looks like concrete rather than just wood good god this has been a right pain in the neck anyway before I get a bit too excited it is sitting the records we have of the Shia dynasty that the emperors of C are around this time were given over more towards alcoholism and their own gluttony rather than the gigantic responsibility of ruling and keeping a dynasty and the civilization together and with the declining quality of its leaders we come towards the end of the Shiar dynasty and its subsequent collapse the last emperor of the shi'ar dynasty G ruled from 1728 BC to 1675 BC this last emperor of the shi'ar dynasty was known as great tyrant who was said to have lost the Mandate of Heaven the mandates which gave the Chinese emperors the right to rule having lost the Mandate of Heaven G was overthrown by tang in the year 1675 who would later go on to found China's more familiar and well recognised dynasty of ancient times the Shang Dynasty so there you have it that is the tale of China's supposed first dynasty the Zhou Dynasty now our only problem is that much of it pretty much the entire story of Xie is shrouded in myth legend and the spectacular so that makes the question is there anything concrete other than a couple of supposed dates and names to back up this dynasty's existence well you may be surprised in the 1960's and 1970's ad the notion that the Shia dynasty was simply nothing more than a myth was fundamentally challenged with the archaeological discovery of tools weapons pottery and even the ruins of palaces and stone houses in the area where the Shia dynasty was said to exist in the western regions of Henan Province in the central Yellow River Basin aside from this carbon dating of the artifacts found puts their origin between the years 2000 and 1500 BC however despite these archaeological discoveries the only thing close to a written record by the Jia people that we have been left is just some markings and etchings on pottery found at the site but even though it's not much it's still a start therefore perhaps maybe one day the mystery of the Jia dynasty's existence may yet be solved just like that at the Indus River Valley Civilization there is still much to be discovered about the Shia dynasty mythical or not but with that now ladies and gents it's time I wrap this up just to give you a quick bit of info I now have a Twitter page so go ahead and follow me on twitter at grande portfolio I do a weekly bit of trivia every Monday known as mystery Monday so give us a follow on there for weekly trivia and regular updates on the YouTube channel in particular and whilst you here guys if you liked the video maybe consider leaving a like and make sure you're subscribed so you don't miss out on any historical or cultural content but for now as my paracetamol wears off is time for me to go and bandage my head because this was a pain thank you so much for tuning in and watching guys I'm Lewis of the grand portfolio signing off god I tell you what I need a lie-down after this one [Music] [Music] you "
