"hello everybody, and welcome to a new episode\nof five-minute history! last time we talked about the mysterious and possibly fictional\nXia Dynasty, and today, we will be talking about the Shang Dynasty, so let's go for it! according to the xia shang zhou chronology\nproject, the shang dynasty ruled from about 1600 BC all the way up until about 1046 BC,\nand unlike the xia Dynasty, we have plenty of archaeological evidence to back it up. the best evidence that we have today are the\nYin Ruins in today's Henan province, which are the remains of the Shang's last capital\ncity and also home to the discovery of China's oldest form of writing: the Oracle Bones. The ruins and the oracle bones provided archaeologists\nwith the final evidence that the Shang dynasty was indeed real. They gave us the names of several Shang dynasty\nrulers, important sacrifices that were made to them, important information about battles,\nand lots of other information that helped archaeologists establish kind of a rough chronology\nof the dynasty and prove that it was, in fact, real. Events of the shang dynasty can be found in\nthe bamboo annals and also in Sima Qian's records of the grand historian, though they\ndo convey the main details and don't really provide a comprehensive picture of this time\nperiod. They tell us of a society that occupied the\nYellow River Valley, constantly battled outsiders, and for the first time in written history,\nworshipped. There was a centralized government and a hierarchical\nsociety which was broken down into different classes, depending on that person's contributions\nto society. They break down the events themselves. I only have five minutes, so let's stick with\nthe highlights. Last time, we talked about Jie, what a dick\nhe was, and how he was overthrown by Shang Tang. After his victory, shang tang became the ruler\nof this newly-established dynasty. He was considered a good ruler because he\nseemed to have a genuine concern for his people. He lowered taxes, lowered conscription rates,\nand also, in a particularly difficult situation, gave out money to poor families. He was eventually succeeded by his son, although\nthis is disputed, and shortly after that, the Shang Dynasty entered its Bronze Age. Religious vessels, tools, weapons, and more\nwere made out of bronze, and even today, if you go to many of China's museums, you can\nsee the remarkable bronze work of the Shang dynasty. Traditional sources tell us some very interesting\nstories such as the emperor tai jia, who was so bad when he first became emperor that his\nown prime minister banished him for three years and after he came back and started ruling\nagain, he was so awesome that archaeological evidence has found that some people worshipped\nthe prime minister for hundreds after that whole event happened. How crazy of a story is that? one of the most\nhighly recorded and unique rulers during this time period was wu ding, and there were a\nlot of reasons for that. First, he did something that not very many\nChinese emperors did, and that was that he actually went out and lived among common people. He did that so he could get to know people's\ndaily needs, their problems, and their concerns. Later, he married into neighboring tribes\nin order to get their allegiance. He wrote articles on ritual sacrifice, and\nhe led his armies to many, many victories before he died in the 59th year of his rein. Unfortunately, after the rule of Wu Ding,\nthe Shang dynasty went into decline. None of his successors ever ruled as long,\nas popularly, or victoriously as he did, and I'm going to tell you two stories to illustrate\nthat point. An emperor named Wu Yi was said to have built\na little statue of the god of heaven, played several games of liu bo with it, made lose\nmany times in a row, and then later destroyed it. Another time, he filled up this leather bag\nwith blood, hung it from a tree, show it with arrow, and created what he called his \"shooting\nheaven.\" Talk about a guy with issues, right? He was later killed by lighting on one of\nhis hunts, and this was later interpreted as the gods killing him because of his irreverance. The last emperor, zhou wang, was the craziest\nof them all. As a younger man, he was supposedly immensely\nstrong, compassionate, good, and intelligent. As he grew older, he took kind of a turn to\nthe dark side. He started torturing people for his own and\nhis wife's arousal. He wasted money, he composed all kinds of\nirreverent songs, he hosted orgies and all kinds of bad stuff. He built a wine lake and a meat forest. A giant pool was filled with wine and a mountain\nwas built and the trees were built made of meat skewers. He would float around with his concubines\non a boat, and when they were thirsty, they'd drink the wine from the pool, and when they\nwere hungry, then would grab the meat off of the trees. Obviously, that's not okay, so Jiang Ziya\nled an army against zhou wang. The Zhou trips overwhelmed the Shang dynasty's\npoorly trained soldiers, and many of them defected to fight for the zhou troops. When it became apparent that he was going\nto lose this battle, zhou wang adorned himself in his finest clothes, finest jewels, went\nup to his terrace pavilion and BOOM - set himself on fire, thus ending the Shang dynasty.\nall right, and about wraps it up for the shang dynasty. please like and comment on this video. if you haven't, please subscribe, and I hope\nI'll see you next time with the zhou dynasty!
