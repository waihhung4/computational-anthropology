"welcome to the study of antiquity and the middle ages as always i'm your host nick barksdale and today we are joined by a very special guest to do an episode that you are all going to love and it involves nothing less than the origins of the sumerians in ancient mesopotamia and so mr razib khan thank you so much for coming on the show today my pleasure man would you mind telling us a little bit about yourself sure um so my name is razib khan uh i do a variety of things online you can find me at receive.substance.com please subscribe but um you can also find all my stuff at razib.com so i have contributed to various publications of uh various reputabilities over the years you can find there you know diverse as india today colette new york times i write mostly about science but not always um you know i have my general interests i work in data science a lot so i can just analyze any type of data aside from genetic data and i do have a passion for history um i do not have any degree in history i do have a minor uh german history just randomly but um you know it's a topic that's always interested in me and professionally i have worked at the intersection of genealogy and genetics for about i don't know eight years now so you know i know a lot about that particular topic and i use it to kind of feed into my amateur interest in just deep history in general to my audience also check out the links in the video description below it's not only going to take you to his website but it's also going to take you to the article that really caught my attention and led to me contacting razeeb to basically have him on the show and to walk us through his paper and so without further ado in your article you wrote that if you could get any ancient population genetically typed it would be none other than the sumerians and so my question is why the sumerians well i mean as they say it it all began at sumer right yeah i'm sure you got a lot of um you got a lot of ancient history mesopotamia nerds out there and uh sumerians are kind of like you know every single adjective that you would think of uh mysterious legendary mythical you know um so when uh john maynard keynes bought the bought the papers of um isaac newton you know he said that uh he was shocked because uh newton was the last of the sumerians and so why would someone in the 20th century say that about somebody who lived at the end of the 17th early 18th century was because the sumerians um you know he was saying the last of the sumerians because it began with the sumerians so civilization literacy history as we know it began with the sumerians now some people will say well egypt was about contemporaneous so that's that's pretty much true but um i think the sumerians have just took a little bit by a nose in terms of literacy and uh you know this whole city-state uh civilization this urban lifestyle definitely probably uh started earliest in sumer so the southern half of modern iraq you know um so they called it suman akad and the cod is the northern part as a lot of your viewers and listeners will know uh sumeria is the southern part and it seems like of the um various ethnic groups in ancient mesopotamia and there were many um so primarily semitic speaking acadians and so kane is an east semitic language if you go on youtube and listen to acadian it will sound kind of familiar kind of like let me say it sounds like creepy hebrew okay um there's something off with it but you can like recognize it as hebraic sounding and then sumerian um it sounds okay you know i don't know how many of your your viewers are listeners are religious i don't mean any effects it sounds kind of satanic because it sounds ritualistic but it doesn't sound like anything that you've ever heard of so you can go on youtube and i think i'm sure a lot of your listeners have go and listen to um someone singing the epic of gilgamesh there's like in sumerian and it doesn't sound like anything you've ever heard and that's because sumerian is unrelated to any other language in the world so okay the first literate civilization in the world is they speak a language unrelated to any other language in the world that's kind of weird right so if they spoken indo-european language or somatic language you would just say oh well of course you know there's so many semitic languages around today uh well not so many but actually there are a fair number just most people most people who speak somatic language just be arabic but you know but there's a lot of them there's still like you know languages in yemen all the languages in ethiopia arabic and obviously hebrew now and aramaic still in syria right but um indo european languages in persia india europe etc so sumerian is this isolate right um nobody knows who it's related to or what it's related to where it came from and yet civilization begins to summer so it's kind of a mystery in so far as like this aberration this outlier ethnolinguistically and um you know there's weird things about the sumerians like um like as you know you probably know they call themselves the black-headed people and i'm just thinking like okay but didn't everyone there have black hair like i mean you know what's that i mean it's just like i don't know it's like if there's a scottish village and they're like the red-headed people and they're like well you're in scotland i mean you know i can kind of see it if you were in syria you know the village full of redheads but it's just like okay why are you calling yourself the black you know there's just all these like weird things that don't make any sense but i'm sure that it made sense to them i'm sure there's like a context you know but we don't have that context the context that we have started with them and built up over them so you know they're mentioned in the bible the land of shadow you know and um it's not the sumerians but it's from that same region abraham comes from ur of the chaldees and you know there are debates about whether it's ur in syria or mesopotamia we can set that aside but um it began with the sumerians and they are present in a lot of our mythos and yet we don't know what existed before them and i don't know if you want to get into this but um one of the things about the sumerians and mesopotamia is it looks like in some some ways the uruk period uh before we have history like when they had cities but we can't their writing is really not writing it's more like just like symbols and notation and counting but it looks like it was more extensive than the sumerian period so it was you know we in the modern world tend to think of well in the past we were more primitive but the sumerians just like say people in the early dark ages they had a past which seems to have been ruptured in some way and probably is remembered in their apocalyptic you know cataclysmic literature uh and we don't know what what went on there but i mean maybe that explains why you have this ethnolinguistic isolate surrounded by semitic people you know who have this you know mysterious language in your article you talk about the sumerians being an ethno-isolate group for those who may not actually understand that term would you explain that and then reference that towards the sumerians for us today yeah um so for example uh if you are spanish or if you speak castilian spanish you are not an ethnolinguistic isolate group because you can go to the east and people there speak catalan which is quite different but is related you go to the west and people there speak portuguese and it's different but it's quite related but if you go to the north uh there are these people the basques who don't speak who speak a language that has no rel relative in the rest of the world it's uh isolate and again if you listen to basque it sounds very very strange and alien i think they think the language is called yushikera in its native language but in an area in basque itself but um so i just want to be clear about that so an ethno-linguistic isolate is basically there's no linguistic relationship to peoples all around and so there's no language continuum you can't go all of a sudden you go from one village to the next and people can't understand each other right and in some cases that boundary is like two large language family groups that are meeting so let's say i don't know russian and sino-tibetan on the chinese border okay that makes sense right so there's this huge like gradient that's starting but sometimes you just stumble on like a little a pocket a little area where they're surrounded by a sea of people who speak a totally different language family and that's what the sumerians are like we don't see any other language family any other groups that speak anything related to them if you go right to the north to akad which is around basically around modern baghdad uh those languages as i said earlier uh the semitic languages you can see the names and some of the names would actually i think they're structurally would kind of be familiar because they're also found in the bible in hebrew right and so it's like you'll see names that are akadi and you're like oh okay like it kind of like but then you see um like a sumerian name and you're just like okay what what is what is that even you know mean so i mean like gilgamesh you know that sounds like it's not like a name a kid would make up you know but like it's it's not a kid or um like lugol zaghesi you know i mean these are like really weird names that sound like they're out of like a fantasy novel but they're not they're the first literate civilization in the world so i think that's pretty cool and so it's important to emphasize why they seem so strange and set off and it's because they're not strange they're just different in a very radical way linguistically and you know we're still i you know i'm still trying to wrap my head around that um 40 years you know like nearly 40 years after first kind of becoming fascinated by the sumerians who leonard wooley's you know archaeological uh focus books as a kid the term i keep forgetting the term sumerian and sumer is an exo-nym it's what the akkadians call them okay so i just want to mention that like their own words for themselves are like different and so um it's just like we live in this weird world where we see them through their kind of cultural errors and so when it came to the sumerians and as you begin studying them what were your original assumptions about these people and how did it change over time well so i i think one of my original assumptions is um well they were you know eridu is the most southern is the southernmost city state in sumer and it's known to be the oldest uh and that was the legends uh you know the sumerian um the text that we have and archaeology has kind of confirmed that uh and so you know there was a hypothesis they came from the south which okay where from the south you know their migrating population and um basically as i got older i realized most archaeologists disagreed with these sorts of migratory ideas and um i thought like okay well maybe they were just like indigenous to the land and um you know this like tale of migration was just kind of a myth that they told themselves and as some of your listeners know listeners and viewers um so the hebrews themselves have a story of migrating from egypt and then some archaeologists say oh that's not true they just made that up and okay there's a whole debate about that um sumer is is less controversial mostly because they're just not as culturally you know consumer is kind of like a cultural backdrop to you know the bible but it's not the bible so we can kind of talk about it in a more objective way and so i think it's still kind of up in the air and this is where like the dna part would come in because dna has really illustrated the nature of migrations and mixtures and demographics and unfortunately um we don't have any dna that i know of from iraq i'm assuming that's because of geopolitical reasons um but i mean that's where we are and so when it comes to the origins of the sumerians your original assumptions and what you believe now what has changed for you specifically i have we have ancient dna now from samples a lot in israel like some in syria we have actually a fair amount from the zagros in iran so basically all of the regions mentioned in the epoch of gilgamesh except for the whole mesopotamian territory and as some of your listeners and viewers might know the little geopolitical issue related to the islamic state in iraq um in the middle teens that made archaeology quite difficult so i think that's that's part of the geopolitical explanation of why we're doing the golden i mean it's not even the gold we are still in the golden age of ancient dna but during the period when ancient dna really started discovering things um about the near east and the middle east we just have like a la cune in iraq so what's up with that well i mean what's up with that is like read the news um you know i mean i'm sure that they're super interested in getting the dna but they're also super interested not being kidnapped i think that's what's happening um geopolitics got in the way which is sad because um syria israel and the zagros are liminal to the history initially i mean they became important later but they're originally liminal and so um we kind of have this framework around it and it looks like um between say like 5000 and 3000 bce a little earlier than 5 000 but um there was a lot of genetic difference between the populations in the levant in the west and people the zagros and over this period they mixed you know so that there's this huge that what we call an admixture in genetics uh synthetic synthetic population so one hypothesis would be well maybe the ones in the west spoke semitic and the ones in the east spoke i don't know like languages relate to sumerian and who knows you know but i mean i think um the more and more i think about it this could just be an artifact where in any given region there's a winner take all positive feedback loop dynamic and semitic just happened to win out and there were a lot of different languages in the ancient near east okay um so like we know hurryin the language of the guties elamites these are all languages that have no known relationships right so maybe the sumerians are not that exceptional it's just that they're the ones we have the earliest records from and so on the sumerians in your article you talk about your new model based on what you know now and for our audience would you tell us what is your new model the original model um is okay um they migrated from somewhere else right and so i i i now think they were probably the descendants of the hunter-gatherers in that area and the ancient near east was filled with lots of we would call them isolates because this is before trade and empires and you know religions that bound people together and spread these languages and so the ancient world is probably filled with a lot of um the prehistoric world it's filled with a lot of unintelligible languages i think papua new guinea okay if you read the ethnography of papua new guinea people are shocked that like oh in one valley they speak one language and the next valley they speak a totally unrelated language supposedly like how does that happen right like we're just whoa maybe that's just what was normal in the hunter-gatherer days when people were they were mobile but trade and there was no literacy everything was oral um it could be that there was just a lot more fracturing and we kind of see this in the genetics where there's a huge genetic difference initially between the farmers in uh zagros agro-pastoralis and you know the wheat farmers say in the hills of syria like the mediterranean coast right now syria lebanon that area there's a huge genetic difference the genetic difference between these two groups is it's not totally comparable i don't want to mislead people but it's kind of like the difference between say someone from china and someone from europe today they're very very genetically distant initially at the sa ten thousand years ago at the beginning of the holocene what we call the holocene after the ice age um over time they mix together um in the modern period uh basically by the time that the sumerians are flourishing um proper but you know by third millennium it looks like there's been kind of a mix of the various eastern and western strands so sumerians are part of a synthetic our synthesis right the languages don't necessarily synthesize like that culture is transmitted in a more straight-line fashion whereas genes tend to mix and blend into incline so um i i'm assuming sumerians are one of the linguistic isolates that were present in the early years and as i said i named a bunch of them you know they're like these mysterious people but maybe it's just how the world worked back then and over time things shake out so that you have this um you know winner take all dynamics so you know a weird example france um in 1800 only 10 percent of people spoke what we would call french in france and it was like the dialect of paris today it's like 90 90 some percent obviously but that was a process over two centuries of mass education and an ideology promoted by the central state in the pre-modern world nothing like this happened obviously because in 1800 you know there was french literature but the vast majority of people didn't speak french you know didn't read french and so um what was it like four thousand years ago or five thousand years ago it's like probably like that you talk about how dna realistically won't solve the question of the origins of the sumerians would you expand on that for our audience today well i mean what dna does is um highlights demography and highlights genealogy but um you know we're both speaking the same language nick but genetically i think we're very different you know and so um you know you could get our dna and say oh like these two people are from two different ethnic groups they speak different languages they have different interests well we are on a youtube right now talking about sumerian so maybe your interests aren't that different because like if you go across the world you ask the regular person like you know you know what do you think about sumerians and they'll be like sumeria what you know where i was like we're just like let's let's talk for a while about sumerians okay so the point i'm getting at there is uh you know your ancestry can only tell you so much um we are cultural creatures and the origins of the sumerians and their development as a people and as a culture is not about their genes it's about their memes it's about their ideas and you know we know about the sumerians and the sumerian language in large part because even though they kind of disappeared as a distinct ethnic group by about 1900 bc uh it remained a literal liturgical language so in like the religious rituals of the accordions and the babylonians and uh you know the chaldeans and the assyrians it continued down and it persisted long enough that it's um you know there's extensive material written about the sumerians shanar in the bible um not you know in detail but it's referred to it's part of the mental furniture of people one thousand a thousand years after the sumerians were gone you know which i mean that's pretty rare actually for ethnic group to be remembered and kind of memorialized as part of the cultural background of all of these people in the future so so you know i mean i'm assuming like thousands of years from now we'll still know about the sumerians but there's going to be a lot of groups today that honestly probably don't know about in the future because they didn't get integrated into a religious tradition as part of like the history of that religion right so um the sumerians as a physical entity mixed in with all the people around them um but as a cultural entity they persist and um you know i mean even today um so for example there's an ethnic group called assyrians i don't really know what their relationship to the ancient israeli i mean culturally they don't really have that much to do with the ancient assyrians they're not flaying people alive you know so um so you know assyrians are a name um and again they're referred to in the bible and stuff but i mean the sumerians i think they have a in a way more robust um uh kind of like uh their impact on the future was more robust it was broader it was deeper uh because they created a lot of the motifs a lot of the superstructure of mesopotamian civilization which in its own turn impacted the whole near eastern matrix and then through the bible through christianity and judaism impacted western civilization so in a way the roots of western civilization go back obviously to sumeria and egypt right and so these are the two pillars and then from these it extended down to greece and you know anyone who's interested in uh astronomy knows the importance of sumerians um and you know why do we have 60 minutes in an hour sumerians like you know they had a base 60 uh number system and so within our very cultural framework of our daily lives there are these um relics of sumerian culture that date to 5000 years ago that's kind of crazy i mean we got 60 minutes in an hour because of this like long culturally dead population you know so um i think that's why they're important and i also think that's why it's going to be fascinating when we understand what their demographic relationships are i have some priors on that but we don't know and there's always surprises you know there's always surprises i mean who knows i mean this is just a this is just a speculation but um it could be that um people in mesopotamia because if we can look at the dna and actually um predict people's appearance it could be people mesopotamia didn't have black hair and maybe the sumerians were a migrant i mean i'm just saying it could be true i don't think this is but it could be like i've been surprised like it could be and maybe they call themselves the black haired people because they just look different than everybody around them initially you know these things change really quickly but initially but then like the name sticks you know like why do you call yourselves the black-haired people you don't look any different than anybody else like well i mean we don't actually know anymore like that's actually a common thing where it's like people don't know why they're doing certain things and they call themselves certain things because you know it's not like it's not like people have like archival phonographs back then you know everything most it's mostly oral and there's a little bit of written you know but the written stuff is like okay like this is what gilgamesh did like it's not an ethnography you know so um it's probably a lot of it's gonna be mysterious to them and it's gonna take a lot of work to figure out the details it's not just the sumerians um we have the elamites you know to to their east who again are an isolate possibly related to the dravidian languages but that's really speculative and most people are skeptical but people are stretching to look at like it's just a little weird that you know you have these names and you can't connect them into the framework of what we have all around us today and we want to do that you know so the gutie okay and isolate the elements and isolate the sumerians and isolate like what's going on here like people are just they want to integrate them into a framework and perhaps perhaps the framework we have around us is just totally new and it's just something to our age you know iron age and later you know like maybe the bronze age was totally different you know bronze age was more it was basically like papua new guinea ethno linguistically but obviously it had literacy and other things that papua new guinea didn't so it's kind of like a hybrid that we can't really integrate and so when it comes to the subject of ancient dna the studies that we know will continue to be done in the future what are your speculations as to what we will find out as the years go by yeah so um we have ancient dna as i mentioned earlier um from iran zagros region western iran also like the rest of iran but for the purpose of this conversation western iran zagros basically um the mountains mentioned in the epic of gilgamesh you know uh and then to um to the uh west you don't have any from iraq i believe we will have them from iraq uh within the next 10 years it just has to happen um okay so we're going to have them from iraq also there is a democrat there is a temporal um uh temporal lacunae where there's a kind of a gap between like right before writing until about 1800 bce okay and so um and you know we have 1800 bce we have some samples from palestine israel whatever you want to call it but we don't have to we don't have anything between 2000 and 3000 bc so we're going to have that from iraq like basically everything we're covering here it's totally speculative in a way that it's not speculative for all around temporarily and spatially and so i think in the next 10 years we're going to close up that gap and a lot of these speculative um answers that i'm giving you will not be speculative we will know i i i can tell you in 10 years what percentage of the ancestry of people in basra comes from the sumerians in 10 years i will be able to tell you that okay i can't tell you right now it could be ten percent it could be ninety percent you know um i think it's gonna be closer to ninety percent but i'm not sure you know i think it's going to be pretty high i think but um what we found in certain areas is there's total turnover so um so for example like when the epic gilgamesh when the events in uric were happening at the time europe looked totally different genetically okay um there was a lot of change going on and so if india looked totally different genetically so i mean maybe the middle east there was stuff going on i mean i because we have dna before and after i'm pretty sure it's not as extreme the middle east has a really ancient history these farming societies are very very well established but you know there's going to be some surprises and so i think in the next 10 years it's going to be an exciting time to be a mesopotamia head and um you know culture and history and the texts they're still going to be dictating things but when you have the dna it just sheds a whole new light on speculations and i think a lot of your viewers and listeners know that we know that as archaeology really took off in the ancient near east as historians from the 19th and early 20th century and even today tried to really excavate these ancient civilizations and cultures we know that they found sumerian burials we know like this the sacrificial pits of ur for example so on and so forth my question is is why in the world have they not tried to date or do carbon testing on the bodies that they found yeah um so a lot of i think you know i'm not an expert but my from knowing what ancient dna people have to go through a lot of it has to do with like various political things you know political aspects and um the positive thing about places like iraq and egypt is they have native archaeol you know they have i'll say native they have people there they have an archaeological tradition that goes back a while now um because i mean why wouldn't they egyptology you know what i'm saying i mean these are like i mean especially in egypt iraq's a little different because of its political instabilities um egyptologists egyptian egyptologists themselves are like rock stars and celebrities in their own country right so um so that creates like a lot of opportunities but it also creates some headaches because okay like how do you divide the credit and the precedent i mean you know let's be frank in some countries um researchers are just excited to get on a paper or they just give them the samples and just they're like here's our samples here's the samples you know we'll get out of paper in nature they're just excited about that it's not quite the same in other countries like egypt for example where it's just like you know they're like they feel like they got something to contribute here too and they're not just going to be like sample providers right so i think part of that has to do with that sort of attitude where people are quite proud and they have their own you know culture and history and they want to own it and they want to you know interpret it themselves and then i think with iraq in particular i think a lot of it is just have to do a little recent political instability i mean just you know kidnap you know you know kidnappings all the standard stuff was just because there's a lot of low-level violence and i think people don't want to deal with it that's my understanding um you know there's a reason that there's a lot of sam there's many samples out of israel for all of the you know stuff you see the news israel just it's a pretty normal country you just go to israel get the samples there are some older samples that people have from syria but it's obviously not recent you know and so politics just gets in the way in a lot of these places i can tell you i can tell your viewers and listeners i have heard that ancient dna has had a problem this year because there's a lot of travel that's required because these are very valuable samples and it's not the kind of thing that people just put in dhl like you know the researchers need to fly so you know this last year with ancient dna um i've heard that the you know issues with travel and flight have caused a diminishment in the data production because these are not things you can just put in the post you need to have people fly there bring some samples back prep it and bring it back to your laboratory and so um you know covet 19 has just impacted that you know it's not just politics it's just the world um you know this is science that's happening in the world it's not just abstract like we as consumers of the science are just you know just produce the data you know produce the papers like we just want to know but you know it involves people and so the real world gets involved so it gets you know interferes in that so i think that's what we're seeing here and uh but you know hopefully we'll have um a calm 10 years i don't think we will but hopefully i'm hoping i'm hoping you "
