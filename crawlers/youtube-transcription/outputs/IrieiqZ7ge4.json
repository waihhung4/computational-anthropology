"(jazzy piano music) - [Beth] We're looking at\nan amazing ancient Chinese bronze vessel, one that's\nabout 3000 years old. - [Keith] Objects like\nthis were made to be used in elaborate ritual banquets\noffered to deceased ancestors. For a pitcher or a ewer like this it's thought that its particular function would have been containing warm liquids. That's why it's got a lid. Probably wine made from brewed grains, the ancestral version of\nsake that we know today. - [Beth] Ancestor worship\nis such an important part of Chinese culture and this\nis during the Shang Dynasty when this practice emerges. - [Keith] Ancestor worship has\na very long history in China. We can be very confident\nabout its existence during the Shang Dynasty\nbecause bronze containers that were used in ritual\nceremonies often bear inscriptions and the inscriptions\nname deceased ancestors, my deceased father, Ding,\nmy deceased mother, Wu. So we know that these objects\nhad close associations with deceased family members. - [Beth] And they were\noften found in tombs. - [Keith] Vessels like this\nwere made for use during life. They're often taken to the grave because there were treasured\nobjects and there was a sense that ancestor worship had to\ncontinue in the afterlife. - [Beth] I think it's\nimportant for us to talk about how difficult it\nwas to make these objects. - [Keith] The advent of the use of bronze signifies an important\nturn in human history. Bronze is a man-made medium,\nso it illustrates very clearly the advent of the human ability\nto manufacture materials that don't occur in nature. Now for bronze, the constituents\ndo appear in nature. It's copper, tin and lead. We're looking at the final\nstage of a very long process that needs to be traced all the way back to the extraction of the\nraw ores from the earth. Those ores would have been refined and possibly shipped a long distance from their source of extraction\nto where they would have been used in foundries. - [Beth] And bronze ages\nin a particular way. And so we're looking at a\nsurface that is very different than when it emerged from its mold. - [Keith] We should think\nof the original surface as like copper new penny. As an object like this is buried for prolonged periods of\ntime in the moist environment of a subterranean tomb, what happens is what we call a patina, a kind of corrosion forms on the surface. - [Beth] As I look at\nthis, it feels as though it's teeming with life. - [Keith] When I first\nsaw this, I was amazed at the vitality of the surface. There are all sorts of\nanimals that are recognizable, but not all are complete,\nin some cases only heads. - [Beth] So for example, at\nthe very front of the lid we see what looks to me like\na monster face with horns. - [Keith] But there's no body. A similarly dismembered element appears at the back of the lid where you've got a head that looks like\nthe head of a buffalo. And again, a search for a\nbody comes up fruitless. - [Beth] And we don't\nalways have real animals. We have imaginary composite creatures. - [Keith] If we look at the buffalo, he's given a pair of very strange horns that are in the form of fish. Not only are these not all real animals, but many of them are quite fantastical. - [Beth] In between the\nrecognizable animals, dragons and elephants and tigers, are these spiral forms\nthat also feel so alive. - [Keith] The tiger looks\nlike he's about to pounce. He's looking over his\nshoulder so you get a sense that the artisan knew the\nanimal that he was drawing. My favorite is the standing bird. From a distance it seems to\nbe represented almost whole. You have him looking straight\nforward with staring eyes. His beak leaps off the\nfront of the vessel. He's got wings along the\nflanks of the vessel. Its legs are actually\nthe front pair of legs of the container itself. But when you start looking closer, components of that bird are\nquite fantastical themselves. The wing takes the shape\nof a coiled dragon. I wish I knew what a person\nwho was using this vessel 3000 years ago would have thought when looking at these motifs. When I look at them a depiction of a world that is in constant flux,\nwhere things are emerging and retreating, coming into\nshape and disappearing, going back and forth\nbetween our natural world and a supernatural world. - [Beth] Also there are\ntimes when we see one animal in the jaws of another. - [Keith] One characteristic\nof Chinese bronzes of this period is a kind of brutality. There's a large monster mask\nwith its jaws wide open. What's inside its jaws,\nbut the head of a humanoid who is essentially the\nback leg of the vessel. And then he seems to be encased in a serpent that surrounds his body. - [Beth] There were many cities that were producing bronze vessels, most of them for ritual use. - [Keith] At the advent of the Bronze Age, access to man-made metal like bronze would have been most important\nfor practical reasons, agricultural tools and\nweapons, for example. What's completely interesting\nabout the Chinese instance is that the resource\nthat could have been used solely for practical reasons of increasing agricultural\noutput or conquering enemies was chiefly reserved for use to create incredibly important ritual objects like containers used in ancestor worship. - [Beth] But that makes\nsense in that world view if the sacrificing to the\nancestors could ensure harvests, could ensure the wellbeing\nof the state and its people. - [Keith] The fact that\nbronze was reserved for these very special functions indicates that these containers were\namong the most important objects that were being made at the time. It's thought that given the complexity of the ancient bronze\nindustry was probably the special prerogative of the king. - [Beth] It looks as though it was cast, it was created in one piece. - [Keith] The lid would\nhave been made separately. And the handle was made as a third piece. Each of those units would have been made in a separate piece mold assembly. So this object started as a ceramic model and the decoration may\nwell have been carved in the ceramic body of the model. It's this technical difference\nthat allows us to think of the Chinese Bronze Age as\nan independent local invention that was created by Chinese craftsmen. (jazzy piano music) "
