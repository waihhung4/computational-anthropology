"[Applause] shung Dynasty in 5 minutes or less let's see if I can do it here we go first where was it okay here is China here is the where the shung dynasty lasted okay that's what we call the Far East one thing you'll notice about uh this dynasty is check it out we got an important river right there Yellow River that's right the shung Dynasty uh they they grew up around the Yellow River they Ed the river to their advantage much like other civilizations out there now uh they ruled for a pretty long time uh the earliest Chinese historians say they ruled for about 644 years but modern historians say no modern historians say that they ruled from 1558 BC to 1046 BC and that was around 512 years of ruling that's pretty long there of course there were some significant rulers in those 512 years uh traditional historians believed this guy Dai ruled but now modern historians uncovered some evidence on some Oracle bones and we'll talk about those Oracle bones in a little bit but they say this guy uh Wu ding was the first ruler of the Shan Dynasty and he my friends ruled for 59 years now one thing that the shung Dynasty are really known for is their ancestor worship and they truly uh believed that uh their relatives were looking down on them their ancestors so if you imagine a family tree uh these are uh the people in their family tree that came before them and what they would do is they would they would often times uh make all sorts of offerings to their ancestors including wine food and yes uh some human sacrifices for their ancestors and uh they did communicate with their ancestors through what's called Oracle bones and these things are pretty cool because they are literally bones they are bones that the ancient Chinese used to uh talk to their ancestors and this happens to be the shoulder blade and Ox so what they would do is they would they would have two two uh sentences a positive comment and a negative comment and uh they would ask a Oracle or you know like a fortune teller and they would say something along the lines of will we have a good far Harvest or uh will we receive a bad Harvest okay and then then they would uh heat up a metal rod and here's another example of or Oracle bone they would heat up a metal rod and uh they would poke it into a hole on the Oracle bone and then the bone would crack and then the Oracle would would read the answers through the cracks okay it's a oh here's a pit of Oracle bones uh it's a uh a way of getting the answers through uh their ancestors okay now the shung dynasty were were big on bronze okay they made bronze weapons they made bronze vessels uh they certainly did not make bronze shoes um but what they did use is the bronze to their advantage they were they were a civilized civilization they were Advanced and they used bronze to their advantage and unfortunately after 512 years of uh just spending spending spending okay the Empire would soon collapse because of their economy would fall and uh this guy would take over and he happens to be the king of the Z Dynasty so you're going to hear about the Z Dynasty in uh the next history in 5 minutes there are some sources thanks for watching [Music] oh "
