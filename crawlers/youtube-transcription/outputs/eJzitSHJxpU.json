" Home O'Habelis lived in a prehistoric hell. Wain only about 30 kilograms or 66 pounds, they were susceptible to all sorts of predator. In a time of darkness when brains were small and tools were primitive, our ancestors often became prey. Despite having very fragmented remains of the species, we do have a surprising amount of evidence that they were preyed upon. In the Old of I. Gorge, three specimens show evidence of predation. The foot of a specimen, O'H. Ate, was bitten by either an aisle crocodile or the monstrous crocodile is anthropic. Not only would antopropagus appear like a dinosaur to us, it must have seemed like a glyath to the small haveless of the area. The remains of another individual named O'H. 35 had crocodile bite marks and a bite marks in a lepron. This poor soul fell victim to two predators likely on the same day. These remains can give you a picture of just how dangerous old of I. Gorge would have been around two million years ago."
