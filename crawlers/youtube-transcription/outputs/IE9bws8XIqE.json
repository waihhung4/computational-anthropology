"- Greetings everyone,\nmy name is Jassim Al-Oboudi. I am a PhD student\nhere at UW-Madison and chair of our\nDarwin Day events. Welcome to all of our\nin-person and online attendees for tonight's session\nof Wednesday Nite @ the Lab, which has partnered\nwith Wisconsin Evolution for this special\nDarwin Day seminar, celebrating the\nenduring contributions of one of biology's\nmost prominent thinkers. And I, of course, by that,\nmean John Hawks. [attendees chuckling] Now, technically, Darwin's\nbirthday is this Sunday, February 12th,\nbut we just couldn't wait to start celebrating, and I hope\nthat some of our events might prompt some of you\nto have your own little Darwin Day\ncelebrations this weekend. I want to briefly note\nthat we have another excellent speaker\nlined up tomorrow, earlier in the day. And on Friday, we have\na community celebration with some free food\nand science outreach activities for kids, which will\nculminate in an art exhibition which features participants of our Darwin Day 2023\nart competition. More details can be found at\nevolution.wisc.edu/darwin-day. I would also like\nto acknowledge support for our Darwin Day events from the College of\nAgricultural and Life Sciences, the College\nof Letters and Sciences, the Nelson Institute\nfor Environmental Studies, and the Graduate School\nof UW-Madison. Now for the event at hand. It is a real privilege for me\ntoday to introduce John Hawks. He is the Vilas-Borghesi\nDistinguished\nAchievement Professor in the Department of\nAnthropology here at UW-Madison, a department he joined as an\nassistant professor in 2002. John engages in diverse\nscience outreach, including an active\nsocial media presence, a personal website detailing\nscientific advances, and contributions to popular\nbooks and lecture series on evolutionary biology. He's also conducted\nextensive work on human evolution,\nparticipating in projects that range from the origin\nof early humans all the way up to the last 10,000 years\nof our history as a species. This includes extensive\nfield work in Africa, Asia, and Europe, analyzing\narcheological specimens and conducting complex analyses\non genomic data from humans. Notably, John has\nextensive collaborations with members of the\nUniversity of Witwatersrand in South Africa, with which\nhe has made important and compelling contributions to our understanding\nof human evolution. But you are not here to hear me. You are here to listen\nto the expert. So without much more ado,\nand I appreciate your patience with me, please join me in\nwelcoming Professor John Hawks. [attendees applauding] - That's great;\nthank you so much. All righty, thank you everybody. I am so excited\nto be here tonight. You know, it's been a long\ntime since I was here, and I'm gonna give you\nsome updates on what we've been up to. We have exciting things going on\nin the field in South Africa. I'm gonna focus tonight\non the bigger picture. How do discoveries about the\nbehavior of ancient hominins, who are very diverse, how\ndo they inform our knowledge of ourselves and our connections with those other\nancient hominins that existed in the past? We are truly encountering minds\nthat are different from our own, minds that may be shared\nfrom common ancestors with us, and finding evidence of them is telling us about what\nthose ancestors were like, but also minds that have\nundergone their own adaptive and evolutionary processes,\nminds that have become different from ours in intricate\nand interesting ways. I'm gonna start, as I often do,\nby taking you into the field. Since I was here last, we've\nhad a number of discoveries in the Rising Star cave system\nof South Africa. This one was in the news\nabout a year ago, the discovery of a skull\nof a child Homo naledi individual\nthat we named Ledi. The Rising Star cave system is underneath this\nreally wonderful, sort of lovely,\nnatural area now, and if we go underground\nas I was this last summer, we find a complex cave system with more than three kilometers\nof mapped passageways. I wanna take you\nvirtually underground. This is a part\nof the cave system. We're now flying past\nthe Dragon's Back and into the Dragon's Back\nChamber. And you're gonna\nhear a good amount about that in a little bit. The narrow passage\nthat you see there is the Superman's Crawl,\nand as you emerge from it into a larger chamber,\nyou have to turn and climb, and that climb takes you\nthrough tortuous passageways that involve a couple of ladders\nand some pretty narrow squeezes until you reach the upper parts\nof the cave system and the main entrance\nof the cave that we're flying past now. This is just a small part\nof the cave system. It is a beautiful\nunderground space. It's intricate\nin its passageways, and it is challenging for our team to go through\nin many places. There are parts\nof the cave system that are incredibly difficult\nto pass through that I cannot enter, that I\nhave incredible colleagues and collaborators\nwho have the skills and are able to do it,\nand it's an amazing experience to be able to be there\nand be part of the research. As I've, probably\nyou've heard before, the Homo naledi discovery began\nin a part of the cave system that we today call\nthe Dinaledi Chamber at the far left of this image. That chamber is connected\nto the rest of the cave system through a very narrow\nvertical passageway that we call the Chute. That vertical passageway is\nabout a 40-foot climb down into the Dinaledi subsystem\nof the cave, as we call it now,\nand it has a minimum width of about\nseven and a half inches. It is a very challenging climb\nbased on size, and so it takes very specialized\nskills to enter this. When Steve Tucker and\nRick Hunter entered that space for the first time in 2013,\nthey discovered bones on the floor of the chamber. Lee Berger, my collaborator at the University\nof Witwatersrand and National Geographic and I have described all of this\nin our book Almost Human. This is old news at this point, and so I'm gonna\ntalk about new news. But let me set the context. After we discovered this\nenormous array of bones, more than 2,500 fossil fragments\nof Homo naledi to date that we've uncovered and\nexcavated from the cave system, as we uncovered this,\nwe faced a number of interesting discoveries and a number of challenges\nof interpretation. Homo naledi was very similar\nto us in some important ways. They were upright walking. They walked bipedally,\nlike we do. Their legs were relatively long\nfor their body size, and so we think that they were\nefficient long-distance walkers. They were relatively skinny. They stood about the height of very small-bodied human\npopulations today, something like 4' 6\" to 5' 2\"\nin females and males. Their body mass was\napproximately 40 to 50 kilograms, so something like\n80 to 120 pounds, so they're small-bodied human\nin size. They're walking like us,\nbut they have adaptations in their shoulders and their\nhands that indicate to us that they were probably\nmuch more efficient climbers than humans are today. Their hands, however,\nhave morphologies that are specialized in the\nwrist, in the fingertips, and in the sort of\nflexibility of the fingers, the length of the thumb\nin particular, that are associated in humans\nand Neanderthals with stone tool manufacture. And so we think that they\nwere competent tool makers in addition to being\nvery good climbers. There were many differences\nbetween their skeleton and ours that set them closer to some\nearlier relatives of ours, relatives like Australopithecus. In particular, the size\nof their brains was about a third the size of the\naverage human brains today. Their range about\n450 milliliters to about 600 milliliters. That's the size\nof very early hominins and very different\nfrom today's humans. So this species was\nreally different from us in really interesting ways. We discovered over the course\nof a couple of years of work that the time that these\nhominins were deposited in this cave system was between\n241,000 and 335,000 years ago. So this species existed\nat around the same time as our own species was\nfirst coming into existence in the range of about\n200,000 to 300,000 years. That made them much more recent\nthan the very early hominins that they resemble\nin some details. Australopithecus lived\nin this part of South Africa before about two million years\nago. So this species is here\nat the same time as our immediate ancestors, and that posed a number\nof challenges. What were they doing there\nand how did they potentially coexist with other\nspecies, including our own? In 2017, we announced the\ndiscovery of a second chamber in the cave system,\nthe Lesedi Chamber, that included this\namazing skeleton, the Neo skeleton,\nas we named it, and a number of other\nfossil discoveries. This second chamber highlighted\nto us that this species was not just an\naccidental occurrence in one remote chamber. This was a species that was\nactually using substantial parts of this underground space, space that has not changed\nin its depth or in its difficulty to reach in the most distant parts\nof the cave since Homo naledi\nwas using the cave system. Since I talked with you last,\nwe had some of the Homo naledi fossils\nhere in the United States. In Dallas at the Perot Museum\nof Nature and Science, our team helped\nassemble an exhibition of Homo naledi material that\nincluded the reconstruction of this beautiful\nskeleton reconstruction by an artist of Neo,\nso you get an idea of what Homo naledi looked like\nfrom a distance. And I think that\nin skeletal terms, this is a pretty good\nreconstruction. Since I talked\nwith you last here at Wednesday Nite @ the Lab,\nwe also have done a really amazing amount\nof work in visualization and understanding the scope\nof the cave system. I wanna take you\non a virtual reality tour of the Dinaledi subsystem\nof the cave. You're now entering via the\nChute into the part of the cave that we call the\nHill Antechamber. You can see on the floor here\nright in front of us the excavation area that\nI'm gonna talk about in a moment, where we uncovered\na block of fossil material of Homo naledi that\nis really astounding. We're flying over\nthe excavation area and now down a steep slope\nfurther into the subsystem, where we arrive at a choice\nof two passageways. And we're about to enter\ninto the left-hand one and squeeze along another\nabout five meters through this very narrow\npassageway into the Dinaledi chamber\nitself. That chamber is a special space. It's a place where Homo naledi\nexisted at one time, where we've found more bones\nof them than we've found of any other hominin\nexcept for Neanderthals in an assemblage this large. It's a remarkable space,\nand the floor area of this still contains abundant\nfossil material. You can see here an area that\nwe had been excavating in 2018, and that remains there\non the floor of the chamber as we study it and try to\nunderstand its arrangement and what it represents. The Letimela discovery\ncame from further yet. If you go past the\nDinaledi Chamber, you enter into an intricate\nseries of fissures that, as you'll see Steve Tucker\nhere moving through them, are incredibly narrow. You're gonna hear the word\nincredibly narrow from me a lot tonight,\nbecause that's a theme in this cave system. Here you'll see Steve taking\noff his helmet so that he can squeeze through this\nplace that's too small for his helmet to pass. And continue on. You'll see the light\nthere past him. It's about three meters distant. And if we go further on,\nSteve has the video now and he's recording Marina\nElliott, who is excavating in this situation\nin a remote fissure passage that's about 10 meters further\nthan the Dinaledi Chamber, where on the floor surface\nwere bones of Homo naledi. We are finding bones of naledi in incredibly difficult\nto reach places, in places that are rather\ndifficult for us to understand in terms of how the bones\nreached this place, what the behavioral interactions\nwere that were leading naledi\nto be in some of these spaces. They're remarkable,\nand they're a big challenge for us to understand. Here, where Marina was working, was where the\nLetimela skull was. We now have discoveries\nof naledi bones from more than seven localities\nthroughout the cave system. This is an amazing array\nof evidence of the behavior\nof this fossil species. We are working to understand\nthat now. One hypothesis that we're\nworking with is the hypothesis that naledi was using these\nspaces for mortuary practices, that there was something special\nabout their interaction with these deepest parts\nof the cave system. For naledi to be so familiar\nwith some of these very remote spaces\nindicates to us that they must have been\nusing the cave system in its more easy to reach\nsurface areas really quite a lot. And so you know, they must\nhave been living there and they must have been\ncarrying on ordinary activities in some parts of the cave system for them to be\nfamiliar enough with it to move into these very deep\nparts of the cave system where they apparently carried\nout different activities, special activities. Why do I say special? Because ordinarily,\nwhen we find hominin remains inside of caves where the\nhominins are hanging out, we find abundant evidence\nof their lives. We find the stone tools and\nthe refuse of tool manufacture. We find the bones of animals\nthat they were interacting with. We find evidence\nof their behaviors other than their bones. In this context so far,\nwe're finding evidence of naledi remains, including\narticulated parts of skeletons. So we have set out during\nthe past several years to investigate more broadly\nthe utilization of the cave system to try\nto understand the behavior of this ancient species. We are working to understand\na cultural pattern of activity, and we're doing it by probing,\nexploring, and excavating in spaces where we have\nno evidence previously. Here you'll see\nMaropeng Ramalepa, one of our exploration team\nworking in the Hill Antechamber. He's digging right here\non a shelf of flow stone right at the base of the Chute\nas you enter into the chamber. This is Becca Peixotto working very near where you\njust saw Maropeng, and she's working on\na ladder beneath her on the Hill Antechamber floor. I told you that there\nwas an excavation area. This is what she's working on. And in 2017, our team\nexposed a massive assemblage of naledi fossil material\nthat we documented and put inside a plaster jacket,\nlike a dinosaur bone, and brought it out of the Chute. This was a major accomplishment, and the team had to have\nenormous teamwork to do this. We have, since that time\nin the spring of 2018, been studying the contents\nof this block. And the contents of the block\nare nothing short of amazing. You can see abundant skeletal\nand dental material in this. There's evidence from many parts\nof the body of at least two individuals. It's a remarkable array of bone. We're studying it\nwith techniques that have never\nbeen applied before, including right now, this block\nis in Grenoble, France, where it is undergoing synchrotron-aided\nmicro CT scanning, which gives us a scan\nof the inside of this thing at nano,\nat micrometer resolution. So it is going to be A,\nan enormous amount of data, I gotta tell you, but B,\nit's going to be one of the most detailed\ndocumentations of a fossil assemblage\nof hominins that's ever been uncovered. Unfortunately, that\nkind of work takes time, and so as that develops,\nwe're continuing to work by exploring and excavating in other parts\nof the cave system. The Dinaledi Chamber, which\nyou reach through the Chute, is adjacent to a massive block\ncalled the Dragon's Back, which is a narrow ridge\nof rock that extends to a maximum height of about\n12 meters or about 40 feet, which you climb to get to the\narea where you can access the Dinaledi subsystem\nof the cave. That Dragon's Back\nis our access point to the Dinaledi subsystem. We think that it was also\nHomo naledi's access point, and our work in geology\nand in excavation is targeted toward understanding\nwhat the interaction of naledi with this area\nmight have been. This last year in 2022,\nwe began an excavation in the Dragon's Back Chamber. It's logical that if\nHomo naledi was accessing the deeper parts of the cave through the Dragon's Back\nChamber, that indeed we might\nfind evidence of Homo naledi's activity in\nthe Dragon's Back Chamber also. But we had never\nexcavated there. It was a passageway for us,\nbut we hadn't dug to see what was\nunderneath the surface. I will say, we had some\npretty good reasons to think that there might\nbe something interesting under the surface. There are brecciated fossils\nthat are in the ceilings and some low overhangs\nwithin this chamber that include bones that\nlook like Homo naledi bones. And so this is a\npretty promising place to look for fossils. And in 2022, our team\nassembled in July and August and began working in the\nDragon's Back Chamber. You see here the team\ngetting going, including on the right here,\nSarah Johnson, who's here in the crowd, our graduate,\none of our graduate students here at the University\nof Wisconsin. Yeah, give her a round\nof applause please. [attendees applauding] You gotta understand,\nshe is sitting here listening to me say, \"This is an\nincredibly challenging climb, this is so difficult.\" And when Sarah came out of the\ncave having done this climb, she says, \"I don't see\nwhat's so hard about that.\" [audience chuckling] Now, there's some\ndifference in dimensions [audience chuckling] between me and her\nthat make this somehow a different kind\nof physical challenge. And I will say that it's\nnot only about body size. It's also about climbing skill;\nit's also about body awareness. And Sarah is a climber\nand she's really good at it. So having her join\nthis expedition to work in Dragon's Back\nwas really amazing. The Dragon's Back excavation\nseason this year was supervised by Dr. Keneiloe Molopyane,\nwho is our team member and collaborator at the\nUniversity of Witwatersrand and included two of our\ngraduate students here from the University\nof Wisconsin, Sarah and Erica Noble. So this was an amazing\nget back into the field and get back into Rising Star\nkind of field season, and it was rewarded with some\namazing discoveries. You see the team here working\nin the Dragon's Back Chamber, Keneiloe here in the front, behind her Erica Noble,\nthen Ginika Ramsawak, and then Sarah there\nfurthest in the back, and we were maxing out the cave,\nright? This is about as much excavation\nas we could possibly do in this area,\nsampling different parts of this area of the cave system. And in this area\nof the cave system, beneath the surface,\nwe found abundant evidence of charcoal and fire. This is a first for us\nin the cave system. And Lee Berger, my friend,\nannounced it to the world last fall. As we're exploring in this\ncave system and beginning to understand that this\nis not just a fossil space, it's actually a cultural space,\nit becomes really important for us to begin to draw\nthe bigger picture of how fossil hominins are\ninteracting with each other and interacting with the spaces. We've begun to understand\nthat this cave system is not only a repository\nfor Homo naledi fossils, it's in part created\nby Homo naledi. And that interaction,\nthe interaction of a species and its landscape, in this case\na subterranean landscape, the interaction of a species\nusing technology potentially to find ways\ninto deeper portions, that's something\nthat's very special. Now, it takes a while for us\nto understand the full context of something like discoveries\nhere, charred animal bones, in the previous slide\nyou saw a hearth. It takes a while for us\nto do the chemistry and to really understand, okay, how much can we\nreally say about this? What I can say is that\nwe've found this in an area that previously\nwe have only evidence of Homo naledi's entry,\nso from that standpoint, we're working\nwith the hypothesis that here we have some\nkind of interaction. What we'll continue to do\nis excavate and contextualize\nthis kind of evidence, and that will take us some time. But immediately,\nas we discovered that there was fire evidence,\nwe realized that we had to reevaluate larger parts\nof the cave system to try to discover\nwhat other evidence in the cave system\nthere might be besides the fossil bones\nthat we've found. Here you see Lee\nand Dirk van Rooyen, one of our exploration\nteam members going out the south entrance\nof the cave system, and I'm taking the picture. As we explored the cave system looking for potential cultural\nevidence, the cave system, as I said, was three kilometers\nunderground, and it's complicated. I'm gonna take us, it's an\nextensive system underground, and I'm gonna take us in closer\nto the central areas where we have naledi evidence that includes the\nDinaledi subsystem here and the Lesedi Chamber here in two different passageways\nareas of the cave system. Our entrance to the cave that\nwe use is here on the right. As we explored the\ncave system, we found in another chamber,\nthe Rising Star Chamber, which is one of the most remote\nfrom surface entrances that we've entered so far,\nwe've found quite abundant evidence\nof charcoal, including really distinctive\nchunks of charcoal, scatters of ash,\nand animal bones in association with charcoal. We cannot yet say if these\nanimal bones are left there by naledi, right? There's a lot of dating and a\nlot of work that we have to do to understand what\nthe context is. But we're happening upon a\ncontext which is very unusual. Most human-used caves\nhave scatters of lithics. They have stone tools\neverywhere. They have evidence\nof large mammal bones. This is something that's\nlooking kind of different. And as we study it and probably\nin the upcoming year we'll be excavating in this\nchamber, we'll be working to understand what the\ninteractions in the spaces were. Now, let me say a few words\nabout Charles Darwin. It's Darwin Day at our\ncelebration of this, and the study of evolution\nin a biological sense really began with Darwin. A lot of people read Darwin. A lot of people think about\nDarwin and his contributions. Fewer people read his work\non human origins,  The Descent of Man, than read  The Origin of Species,\nhis more famous work. Darwin thought really hard\nabout where humans came from, and he was famously reticent to share his thoughts\nin public about this after the publication of\n The Origin of Species. A lot of people know\nthat in The Origin, he sort of concludes\nwith the line that light will be shed\non man and his origins, but he doesn't shed any light. It takes him another\n13 years of work to get to where he's ready\nto share his ideas about human origins and human\nevolution with the world. In the meantime, other people\nare working on this, people like Thomas Huxley, one of his longtime\ncollaborators, who writes\n Man's Place in Nature. People like George Mivart, who's working on\nprimate evolution and trying to understand\nthe connections of primates. And Darwin is corresponding\nwith all of these people and trying to come\ninto an understanding of where humans fit\nin the natural scheme. Darwin made many\ncontributions to biology. Natural selection, the idea\nof biological evolution, the mechanism for evolution. To me, the most central\nand important one is the idea that species are\nconnected by a tree. This was really an\noriginal idea of Darwin. People had thought\nabout evolution before. People had not\nthought about the tree of relationships of species. And the innovation of the tree\ngives us the power to understand ancestors\nby studying their many descendants and to\nunderstand different stages of the evolutionary process by looking at the branches\nthat connect at those stages. Darwin famously in his notebook made this diagram of a tree,\nthe one that says, \"I think,\" at the top. This is the most popular\nbiology tattoo, by the way. I recommend it. It's actually,\nit's an iconic image. This changed the nature\nof science, this image. Darwin did not publish\nvery many trees, and in his entire work\non human origins, he published no pictures\nof the tree of relationships of primates or humans to them. But he did think\nabout this a lot and put in his notebooks\nhis ideas of the relationships of species. You see my transliteration\nof this on the right and Darwin's original notebook\non the left. And you see that he puts humans\non the top left next to the great apes,\ngorillas, chimpanzees,\norangutans, and gibbons. They're close relatives,\nand a branch yet further from them are the other\ncatarrhine primates, Cercopithecus, Macaca, baboons, the Cercopithecoid monkeys\nas we consider them today. Another branch further out,\nthe new world monkeys, who we call the\nPlatyrrhine primates today. And then further, the lemurs. This is fundamentally the tree\nof relationships of primates as we understand it today,\nwith the exception that Darwin didn't quite get\nthe place of humans correct. Darwin, like most people at\nthe time, thought that humans have a long branch\nthat separates us from other great apes,\nother closely related primates. Today, we understand that\nwe are among the great apes. Our branch is most closely\nrelated to a branch that includes\nchimpanzees and bonobos, Pan paniscus and troglodytes\non this tree. The human chimpanzee branch is\nrelated to a gorilla branch, Gorilla gorilla,\nGorilla beringei, the western\nand eastern gorillas. That branch is connected\nto an orangutan branch, which today is occupied\nby three living species and many fossil species. Here you see Pongo pygmaeus,\nBornean orangutans, Pongo abeliis,\nSumatran orangutans, and Pongo tapanuliensis,\na recently discovered species in a small area\nof Aceh in Sumatra. Their ancestry goes back as long\nas three million years ago. The ancestors of today's\ngreat apes go back in time into a time when our own lineage\nwas also diverse. This isn't as widely\nappreciated as it should be. These primates were diversifying in the same timeframe as our\nancestors were diversifying. We have an abundant record\nof human origins. This is at the Smithsonian,\na wall of skulls, where you see, I think, more\nthan 150 different skulls of fossil hominins from the\nbeginnings of our lineage more than six million years ago\nup until the recent past. It's an enormous array\nand it's full of skulls. There are relatively few\nor complete or partial skeletons of things, but there are some\nimpressive ones. And as we go closer and closer\nto the present, we find partial skeletons\nof Neanderthals and more recent modern forms\nof humans. We have abundant\nskeletal evidence of our evolutionary history. If I look at some\nof that evidence, I've put up here sort of\nmy own wall of skulls, this is not super representative except insofar as I've tried\nto put a skull up here for a number of species,\nand you'll see 17 of them. And if we look at these skulls and their arrangement,\nwe can make a tree very much along the lines that\nDarwin might've made, where we have species\nlike our own at the far right and species that are close\non the tree to us that lived in the past\nthat are now extinct, and as we go\nfurther to the left, species that are progressively\nmore and more distant from us in terms of their common\nancestry on the tree. If we look at that\nleftmost part of the tree and consider the kinds\nof hominins that were there, we see hominins that\nbelong to genera called Australopithecus\nand Paranthropus, genera that are today extinct\nand have been extinct in the case of Paranthropus\nfor more than 800,000 years; in the case of Australopithecus,\nfor nearly two million years. These were diverse and they\nlived for millions of years. Today they're gone, but one branch of them survived,\nand that branch, after two million years ago,\nalso diversified. That branch includes all\nof the extinct species that we consider to be members of our own genus,\nthe genus Homo. You'll see here\na wide array of them, humans again\non the farthest right, surrounded by other humans\nthat are kind of like us in some really important ways,\nhumans that we today call the Neanderthals\nor archaic humans. We see extinct species\nlike Homo erectus. An extinct species, Homo naledi,\nhas its place on this tree. Earlier extinct species like Homo rudolfensis,\nHomo habilis. These represent ancient\ndiversity that once existed that our own branch evolved\nfrom and that we have survived. Our origin was an origin\nthat was not alone. It was an origin that\nwas among many others. And those others had\ntheir own ways of living, their own ways of thinking,\ntheir own ways of being. We've recently gotten\na lot more evidence about these relationships\nfrom genetics. And it would be wrong for me\nto talk about the tree without showing you\na genetic tree. DNA evidence goes back\nonly in the maximum case in humans so far,\naround 430,000 years. We have DNA from an early\npopulation of Neanderthals from Sima de los Huesos,\nSpain that is that age. So we know something about\nNeanderthals, we know something about other kinds of hominins,\nincluding a fossil population called the Denisovans\ndiscovered initially from this tiny piece\nof a finger bone from Denisova Cave in Siberia. Today, we understand that\nthis was a diverse branch of ancient hominins that\nlived alongside Neanderthals and our own species\nprobably in the eastern and southeastern parts of Asia. And we understand\nthat today's people and these ancient people had\ninteractions with others, others that we have echoes\nof in the DNA that survived. So those others we cannot yet\nidentify with fossil evidence. We have genetic fossils\nin this sense. The Denisovans are a\ngreat example of that. Initially found\nfrom a finger bone, today we still\ndo not have a skull that I can show you the face of\nthat we know to be associated genetically\nwith this population. We do have a jaw,\nand so there's something, and we will have more. There's almost certain\nwe're gonna have more. But as we go further\nback in the past, we discover that these lineages\ninteracted with each other. They mixed with each other\nand they mixed with others. Our tree was a tree in which\nour species originated among others, and those\nothers did not just form part of the scenery; those\nothers were interacting with and interbreeding with,\nin some cases, each other. We come from a tree\nwith hybridization. That means that these\ndifferent species interacted and they interacted\nthrough cultures. Now, as we look at this tree\nand see the diversity of hominins that are\npart of it and understand that they each had\ntheir way of living, they each had their time,\nthey each had their place, and they mixed with each other, we can start to assemble\na timeline to try to understand\ntheir interactions. Here we see humans\nat the far right again, that's the present day, and there's a density\nof evidence of these other kinds\nof species coexisting with our species\nat various places. We see that there's\nNeanderthals at the top and archaic humans\nfrom East Asia next to them. There's modern humans\nand archaic humans from Africa. There's Homo naledi that coexists\nwith early modern humans, and there's the very\nsmall-bodied species from Indonesia, Homo floresiensis,\nthat also persists until 65,000 years ago. As we trace our branch\nearlier in time, there are other times that we see many species\ncoexisting. These interactions\namong these species must have mattered\nto our ancestors. They formed a part\nof what made us human. Now, I'm very concerned now with understanding\ntheir behavior. How did these ancient hominins\ninteract? What was their way of living? What were their minds like? When the title of this talk\nwent out on Twitter, people sort of\nkicked back at me. They're like, \"Minds, what\nare you talking about, minds? \"This is fossils,\nthis is archeology. We're not looking at minds.\" Minds are our way\nof experiencing the world. They're also our only way\nof connecting that experience to the world itself. Minds are our interface\nwith the world around us. That means that they're\nalso our interface to the other individuals\nin the world around us and the interface\nto the other species that existed in the world\nin the past. When we look at the brains\nof ancient hominins, we're not looking at minds. It's a challenge for us\nscientifically to try to connect those things\nwith each other with evidence. Here you see\nexceptional endocasts, natural casts formed\ninside of skulls. We can study the\ninsides of skulls and we can look at them\nand get a lot of them. An obvious one that I\npointed out earlier is that Homo naledi's brain size\nis about a third the size of the other hominins\nthat coexisted in Africa at the same time. That includes our own species,\nHomo sapiens, and archaic forms of humans, sometimes called\nHomo rhodesiensis. These crania all date\nto the same time. They're very different\nfrom each other in size. An important question is, what difference does\nthat make to behavior? We know a lot about\nthe evolution of the size of the brain. This is endocranial volume,\nhow big the inside of the skull is over time, over the last four million years\nin hominins. I'm gonna parse this out a bit 'cause there's a lot\nof data here, and that data actually is chunky\nwhen you look at the details. If we look within Africa,\nhere's the trajectory. Earlier hominins before\ntwo million years ago all have brains around\n500 cubic centimeters or so. After that time, some hominins\nget bigger brains, but not all. In Africa, you can see that\nthere's later hominins, including Homo naledi,\nthat retain that ancestral, smaller brain size\nor evolve convergently with earlier hominins\ntoward a smaller brain size. If I stretch out the\nlast two million years and look at that timeframe,\nyou'll see that there are individuals\nof Homo erectus throughout this time that approach Homo naledi's\nbrain size. Small brain size is\nsomething that exists across a long span of time. We're used to thinking\nof our species as having been the end of a trajectory,\nwhere that trajectory is toward larger and larger brains. It's actually not the case. Here, you see archaic forms\nof humans like Homo rhodesiensis compared\nto living, modern humans and our immediate\nfossil ancestors. They're a little different\nfrom each other. If we look at evidence from\nSoutheast Asia and East Asia, you can see that erectus. Then there's these archaic\nhumans, and they're big in brain size, and then modern\nhumans are a little smaller. Neanderthals pick up in Europe\nafter about 430,000 years ago, and modern humans\nimmediately follow them. This starts to look\nkind of chunky. It starts to look like groups. Homo floresiensis persists\nin Southeast Asia. So as we look\nat the overall tree of the last two million years\nof evolution, we see that there's a\npattern of diversification. Hominins are becoming different. Those hominins are all\nclassified within our genus. They all share common ancestors\nwith us around two to two and a half\nmillion years ago. They're part of the same tree, but this is a tree that's becoming diverse\nin its brain size and as you've seen a hint\nof with Homo naledi, it's becoming diverse\nin strategies for interacting\nwith the landscape. So going back to this tree, we're now gonna try to\nunderstand the whole organism. How are these\nspecies interacting? Well, there's other things\nto the brain besides its size. This is evidence of the\ninsides of the skulls of Homo naledi brains. We've studied these, and in a\npaper in 2018, our team showed that the frontal lobe\nof naledi's brain actually is very human-like\nin its organization. It's different\nfrom earlier hominins that had smaller brains. It's actually human\nin this respect. There's a structural aspect\nto our brains that is shared with a species\nlike naledi, despite the fact that there's a big size\ndifference in the brains. That may mean something\nvery important. This part of the brain in\nhumans, the left frontal lobe, is essential to forming\nlanguage, syntactic language, making sentences\nthat make sense. We don't know whether\nthat would've been true in ancestral hominins. We cannot see their forms\nof communication directly. We have only a little bit of\nevidence about the vocal tract in some forms of hominins,\nand it does suggest that Homo shares a vocalization\ncapacity with humans. Whether it shared a linguistic\ncapacity or not is unclear. When we think of what\nbig brains are for, there's been a lot of scenarios,\na lot of hypotheses about this, and technology is maybe one\nof the most widely known. These stone points,\nwhich were hafted onto spears, come from Kathu Pan\nin southern Africa about 500,000\nto 300,000 years ago. This is the archeological\nevidence that occurs in the area where\nwe find Homo naledi. We don't know whether\nthis evidence was produced by naledi or whether it's\nproduced by other forms of hominins that may\nhave also existed at the same time\nin the same place. We know that our\nimmediate ancestors in this timeframe existed and they could well\nhave been here. There's also chunks of ochre,\na mineral pigment that you can see the\nengraved lines on. These are made from rubbing\nthe ochre onto hard surfaces. We have other chunks of ochre that looked like they were\nrubbed on soft surfaces. In southern Africa,\nwe don't have fossil remains in direct association\nwith archeology like this. We haven't yet found\narcheology like this in the Rising Star Cave,\nfor example. In North Africa, however,\nthere are very similar archeological forms, and they\nare found in cave layers with early members of our\nown species, Homo sapiens. In East Africa at Olorgesailie,\nthis is a famous site that is just littered\nwith hand axes that you can go as a tourist\nand walk on the walkway and see the hand axe floor\nthere. Those hand axes are around\na million years old, and they are found\nin the same landscape as this fossil skull, which is very similar\nto a naledi skull. This was once classified\nas Homo erectus. Today, I would say\nwe don't know for sure. But there are also pigments\nat Olorgesailie at a younger timeframe, around\n300,000 to 400,000 years old. Pigment use, incision of lines\nbecomes characteristic on pigments after around\n100,000 years ago. Those are the things\nthat people look at and say, maybe brains are doing this,\nmaybe this is what communication takes a form,\ntechnology takes a form that requires innovation\nfrom big brains. People used to say\nthat Neanderthals would've been incapable\nof this kind of thing. Neanderthals have\nvery big brains. Their brain sizes are human\nin their size. Over the last two decades,\na revolution in understanding of the behavioral evidence\nof Neanderthals has happened. Neanderthals are primarily\na Western Eurasian fossil population. Here's a skeleton\nof a Neanderthal that has a hyoid bone, that has a, shows\na human-like vocal tract. The evidence of Neanderthals\nas we've pored over it over the years, these fossil\nfragments from Krapina in Croatia where I'm gonna be\nin a few weeks. This is my friend,\nthe late Jakov Radovcic who used to curate\nthe collection. Those fossil fragments,\nas we've studied them, we've uncovered evidence\nof incised lines on the frontal bone\nof one of these. My friend Davorka Radovcic, who is Jakov's daughter\nand presently the curator of this collection,\nidentified eagle talons that have evidence of where\nthey were strung together. This engraving on the floor\nof Gorham's Cave in Gibraltar, more than 60,000 years old,\nmade by Neanderthals. In addition, pigment spots\nin various caves in Spain and southern France appear to be Neanderthal\nin manufacture. And Neanderthals abundantly\ninteracted with pigments. And in a deep cave in France\ncalled Bruniquel, they constructed a circle\nout of stalagmites. Hominins are experiencing\ntheir worlds and altering them. They're going into spaces that\nother species don't access and they're making things\nthat are different. They're marking\ntheir environments and they're marking themselves. Now, many people look at this\nkind of evidence and think, \"Wow, you know,\nthis is what humans do, so therefore they\nmust be human.\" That's kind of a\nchauvinistic point of view. And there's nowhere that's\nbetter evidence for this than Southeast Asia where,\non the island of Flores, separated from the\nAsian mainland always by a permanent water crossing, even at lowest levels\nof sea level, there are hominins that\nare very different from us, brains that are around 420\ncubic centimeters in size, smaller than naledi's, skeletons that are smaller\nthan naledi's. This species, Homo floresiensis,\nevolved on an island or reached this island\nby crossing over permanent water straits. You may say, \"Well, okay,\nthat could happen. That seems like\nan amazing thing.\" They make stone artifacts\nthat are very interesting, not necessarily super complex,\nalthough these blades are beautifully manufactured\nfrom Liang Bua Cave, where the skeleton that\nI just showed you was found. From Mata Menge, these artifacts\nmore than 800,000 years old indicate floresiensis' presence\non the island at that date. But floresiensis is not alone. On the island of Luzon\nin the Philippines is another small-bodied\nand small-toothed species that existed up until\nthe last 100,000 years. This species, discovered in\n2018, named Homo luzonensis, we don't have a skeleton of\nwith a skull that we can say\nthe brain size of. So we can't say for sure whether\nthis was like floresiensis, but it looks like floresiensis. These are species that\nare crossing water. They're capable\nof colonizing new places, living in new ecologies,\nand doing so with very different\nbiological equipment than we're used to having. They're doing it with\nsmall bodies and small brains. And they're doing it\nnot 100,000 years ago, not 300,000 years ago. They're doing it\n800 to a million, 800,000 to a million years ago. That kind of behavioral\ncomplexity is evidenced in the material record. At Wonderwerk Cave\nin South Africa, some of the earliest evidence\nof charcoal and fire, vastly older than the evidence\nthat we found in the Rising Star cave system,\nindicates that hominins are interacting\nwith fire going way back. Gesher Benot Ya'aqov in Israel\nis an open-air site. It's not a cave site;\nit's by the Jordan River. And in this site,\nthere are hearths where ancient people, 800,000\nyears ago, roasted pistachios. Another thing people say brains\nare for is social behavior, and there's a deep reality\nto this. Hanuman langurs are well-known\nfor their coalitions that they form between males\nto compete to displace dominant males\nwithin a group. That kind of ability to ramp on\nand ramp off aggression in very intricate\nsocial contexts, something called Machiavellian\nintelligence, is something that many scientists think\nbrain size is evolved for. Grooming, getting along\nwith other individuals, affiliating with them is\nsomething that people think, this is what brain size\nis really for. Mountain gorillas. This is a male mountain gorilla\nwho's affiliating with and taking care of this\nyoung juvenile. That kind of social behavior\nis something that we use our minds for,\nright? These are primate minds. I put this slide up here\nto remind everyone that I'm gonna show\na disturbing slide next that includes a dead gorilla. So if that's something that\nyou don't wanna look at, I wanted to alert you to it. Because the other side\nof affiliation, the other side of Machiavellian\nintelligence, the other side of aggression is\ngrief and mourning. Here's a gorilla\nmourning his mother. We find this in the\nfossil record also. At Sima de los Huesos in Spain, the single largest\naccumulation of fossil evidence of any hominin,\nmore than 30 individuals of an early\nNeanderthal population, representing a group\nof some kind in a pit with their bones\ntossed in, probably originally as bodies, many of them the victims of\naggressive or violent deaths as evidenced by perimortem\nwounds on their crania and other parts of their bodies. An intentional act\nof some kind, deep in a cave. Homo antecessor, also\nin the Atapuerca Mountain around 780,000 years ago,\ncannibalized. Groups are interacting\nwith each other in violent ways,\nin aggressive ways, and also in many cases\nin caring ways, in ways that manifest\nthe emotion of grief. When I look at the remains\nof Homo naledi that we're working on\nin the Rising Star cave system, this is what I want to try\nto understand. What do these remains tell us\nabout the interactions of the hominins,\nof the individuals, and we are learning that. So as we look across the tree,\nwe are seeing that there are\ndifferent experiences. And those experiences, we have\nfragments of evidence of. Our field encounters\nmore evidence every year, and we find new ways\nto analyze it. What I'm telling you about\ntonight includes evidence from around the world that\ndidn't exist five years ago. Very little of this stuff\nexisted 15 years ago. We're making rapid advances\nin understanding the lives and cultures\nof ancient hominins. And as we make those advances,\nwe experience joy, but we think about the emotions\nand the joy that the ancient people\nalso experienced. This is where our emotions\ncame from. This is where our minds\ncame from. So I'll leave you\nwith Homo naledi. I think about it a lot. And you saw the\nreconstruction earlier that was very human-like\nin its look. And John Gurche,\nwho's a good friend of mine, a paleo artist,\nhas a reconstruction that is a little bit edgier. We have our ways\nof looking at the past and bringing to it\nsomething different from our own experience. It's a challenge for us\nas scientists to try to go beyond our own minds\nand understand the minds of others, but it\nis so essential because our minds\ncame from them. The tree that connects us\nis the tree that will tell us\nhow our minds originated. With that, I'll end. And thank you all for coming. I'll be happy to take questions\nafterwards. But before I do that,\nI just wanna say I really appreciate you all\ncoming out tonight. It is amazing to be\nback in person here in Madison and giving talks. And I'm really happy that\nit's happening again. So thank you all,\nand I'll be looking forward to coming back again and giving\nyou the next installment. [audience applauding] "
