"prior to the 19th century it was thought that Genesis of the Old Testament contained the oldest material of literature in the entire known world in particular the narratives about the great flood and the Tower of Babel sometime during the 19th century archaeologists in an effort to find the city's mentioned in the Bible found something completely different far more fascinating what they found all over Mesopotamia our cuneiform tablets some of these tablets predated the Biblical timeline of creation itself in the contents of these tablets were shocking [Music] in 1961 Samuel Noah Kramer seriologist translated a text known as Anki in the world order which seems to be a textual ancestor to the Tower of Babel story here's what it says [Music] Sumer great Mountain Land Of Heaven and Earth trailing Glory bestowing powers on people from sunrise to sunset your powers are superior Powers Untouchable and your heart is complex and screwable like heaven itself your good creative force in which gods too can be born is beyond reach giving birth to Kings who put on the good diadem and giving birth to Lords who wear the crown on their heads your lord the honored Lord sits with Anu the king of Heaven your king the great Mountain father and Lil the father of all the lands has blocked you impenetrably like a cedar tree the Anunnaki the great gods have taken up dwellings in your midst and consume their food giguna in your shrines with their single trees household Sumer may your sheepfolds be built and your cattle multiply may your gaguna touch the skies may your good temples reach up to heaven made the Anunnaki determine the Destinies in your midst the mysterious Anunnaki mentioned in that text are described as determining destiny who are these mysterious Anunnaki are these the Nephilim mentioned in Genesis let's find out [Music] hello explorers of the ancient world and initiates it to the Mysteries welcome back to our Channel if you're new here remember to hit that subscribe button and the bell icon so you won't miss out on our Journeys as the fascinating tales of the past today we're embarking on a captivating Expedition Into the Heart of ancient mythology and biblical lore delving deep into the tales of the enigmatic Anunnaki and the Mysterious Nephilim the Anunnaki powerful deities from ancient Sumerian mythology are said to have shaped our world influence Kings and controlled the fate of humanity their stories have fascinated us leading to varied interpretations and even some Modern controversial conspiracy theories and then there are the nephila the Giants of the Old Testament the sons of God Fallen Angels Mighty Warriors Heroes of old or perhaps all of the above their brief but intriguing mentioned in the Bible have given rise to countless interpretations and debates are there connections between these two groups of ancient beings were they celestial terrestrial or maybe even extraterrestrial today we we separate fact from fiction history from myth Guided by archeology Linguistics and the valuable work of countless Scholars so buckle up and join us on this exciting journey into the realm of the Anunnaki in the Nephilim it's time to uncover the secrets of the Ancients let's Dive In foreign [Music] are a group of deities that appear in the mythological traditions of ancient circadians Assyrians and Babylonians they are among the earliest pantheons in Mesopotamian mythology in Sumerian textual Corpus term Anunnaki often refers to deities in the broadest sense however more specifically it often designates a group of gods associated with the underworld where they are said to decree the fates of humanity one of the significant mythological narratives involving the Anunnaki is found in the Epic of Gilgamesh one of the world's oldest known works of literature in the Epic Gilgamesh meets the spirit of his friend in kidu in the Underworld where the Anunnaki act as judges in the Underworld who set laws for the cosmos [Music] Gilgamesh lamented seven days and seven nights he wept for inkidu until the worm fastened on him only then he gave him up to the Earth for the Anunnaki the judges had seized him [Music] tablet 8. Epic of Gilgamesh then in tablet 9 of Epic of Gilgamesh it says the sleeping and the dead how alike are they they are like a painted death what is there between the master and the servant when both have fulfilled their Doom when the Anunnaki the judges come together and mametum the mother of destinies together they decree the fates of men life and death they a lot but the day of death they do not disclose finally in tablet 11. we get the story of the great flood sent by enlil which says the Anunnaki lifted up the Torches setting the land Ablaze with their Flair stunned shock over adad's Deeds overtook the heavens and turned to Blackness all that had been light the land shattered like a pot all day long the south wind blew blowing fast submerging the mountain in water overwhelming the people like an attack no one could see his fellow they could not recognize each other in the torrent the gods were frightened by the flood and retreated ascending to Heaven of Anu gods were cowering like dogs crouching by the outer wall Ishtar shrieked like a woman in childbirth the sweet voiced Mistress of the Gods weld the olden days have a loss turn to Clay because I said evil things in the Assembly of the Gods how could I say evil things in the Assembly of the Gods ordering a catastrophe to destroy my people no sooner have I given birth to my dear people then they'll fill the sea like so many fish the gods of the Anunnaki were weeping with her the gods humbly set weeping sobbing with grief their lips burning parched with thirst six days and seven nights came the wind and flood the storm flattening the land when a seventh day arrived a pushed him sent forth a dove and released it the dove went off sent forth a dove and released it the dove went off but came back to me no perch was visible so it circled back to me I sent forth a swallow and released it the dove went off but came back to me no perch was visible so it circled back to me I sent forth a raven and released it the Raven went off and saw the water slithered back [Music] now compare that text to the Genesis of Noah and the flood after 40 days Noah opened up a window he had made in the ark and sent out a raven and it kept flying back and forth until the water had dried up from the earth then he sent out a dove to see if the water had receded from the surface of the ground but the dove could find nowhere to perch because there was water all over the surface of the Earth so it returned to Noah in the ark he reached out his hand and took the Dove and brought it back to himself in the ark he waited seven more days and again sent out the dove from the ark when the dove returned to him in the evening there in its Beak was a freshly plucked olive leaf then Noah knew that the water had receded from the earth he waited seven more days and sent the dove out again but this time it did not return to him in both cases Noah and utna pushed him are told by a God to build an ark loaded with animals and they both wait an additional seven days after the flood to send off doves and Ravens to check for land and I bring this up because I think it's possible that the Nephilim in Genesis 6 may very well be influenced by the Anunnaki the sons of God who endured the Wrath of the king of the Gods but it's not a one-to-one comparison and I will speak more about the Nephilim later let's talk about the Anunnaki first the Anunnaki have also been connected to the creation of humanity where they are said to have created humans to serve as laborers for the Gods this particular narrative is found in later Acadian and Babylonian mythology especially the Arthur hostas an Acadian Babylonian epic that recounts the creation of humanity The Story Goes that Anunnaki together with the EG another group of gods were burdened with the laborous tasks of digging canals and farming land to feed themselves and the other gods the ajiji who were doing most of the work rebelled as a solution the god enki proposed the creation of humans to perform the labor instead thus humans were created from clay and the blood of a slain God [Music] the enuma Elish another Acadian Babylonian creation Epic tells a similar tale of human creation in this narrative the god Marduk after defeating the Primeval goddess Tiamat creates the world and humans the Anunnaki in this context are considered high-ranking deities in the Divine hierarchy in these stories the Anunnaki play roles as Cosmic legislators creators and sometimes intermediaries between humans and the divine they are integral to the functioning of the cosmos in the human society unto kingu have Tiamat entrusted and costly Ram it she has made him sit saying I have uttered thy spell in the Assembly of the Gods I have raised thee to power the dominion over all the gods I have entrusted unto thee be exalted My Chosen spouse may they magnify thy name over all of them the Anunnaki Tiamat hath given kingu the tablets of Destiny on his breast she laid them saying thy command shall not be without a veil in the word of thy mouth shall be established the numerous tablet 3. [Music] the mythology of the anunnak is complex and spans several ancient cultures with the earliest accounts coming from the Sumerians their stories like many ancient mythologies attempt to explain the origin of the world the nature of the Gods and humanity and the laws that govern existence in Sumerian mythology the Anunnaki were initially viewed as Celestial deities associated with various aspects of life and nature however the term Anunnaki gradually came to be Associated more specifically with cathonic underworld deities in Mesopotamian mythology term Anunnaki was used to refer to deities in general but it was mostly associated with the Underworld the realm of the Dead this does not necessarily imply a negative or punitive Association in many ancient cultures the world was perceived as a multi-tiered structure often divided into Heaven's Earth and underworld gods and goddesses were assigned to different Realms based on their roles and functions the Anunnaki are depicted in various myths as judges in the Underworld ruling over the fate of the Dead for instance the goddess ereshikal the queen of the underworld and nergal the god of death and plague were both considered part of the Anunnaki the reason why many of the Anunnaki are associated with the underworld is likely related to the sumerian's belief about life death and the afterlife the underworld known as cure or irkala was considered a dreary dark place where the spirits of the Dead existed in a shadowy version of the Earthly life similar to Hades in Greek mythology sustained by Libations and offerings from the living the Anunnaki in their role as cathonic deities were seen as intermediaries between the world of the living and the world of the Dead with the power to judge and rule over Souls of deceased humans [Music] [Applause] the term Anunnaki could include a wide range of deities reflecting the complex multifaceted nature of Mesopotamian religious belief so what about the Nephilim why do so many think they're related the Nephilim are depicted in biblical Traditions at The Offspring of the sons of God or fallen angels and are described as Giants in general the Anunnaki and the Fallen Angels who give birth to the Nephilim are separate entities from distinct cultural and religious contexts Mesopotamian mythology and Hebrew religion respectively however there are some parallels both undergo the wrath of God and try to teach humans knowledge both the Anunnaki and the fallen angels are seen as powerful beings with the ability to influence Humanity the Anunnaki as those of royal blood or princely offspring were considered gods who decreed the fates of humanity similarly fallen angels and certain interpretations are thought to have interacted with humans sometimes negatively as misleading spirits but also in some narratives teaching Humanity various arts and knowledge The Book of Enoch an ancient Jewish religious work ascribes the origins of sin and Corruption on Earth to a group of angels known as the Watchers Fell From Grace by mating with human women and teaching Humanity forbidden knowledge but rather than the Anunnaki this story shares more elements with the myth of the akalu seven wise men or demigods Mesopotamian mythology who were created by the god enki to establish culture and give civilizations to mankind while there are thematic similarities and overlaps it's essential to recognize that these myths and traditions develop independently with their own cultural and historical context connection between the Anunnaki and the Fallen Angels is not Direct in their original mythologies I would refrain from calling it a one-to-one comparison but an indirect passed down mythology that changes in context of time and region both the Anunnaki from Mesopotamian mythology and these Fallen Angels or watchers from The Book of Enoch represent supernatural beings who have significant interactions with Humanity in both mythologies there is a theme of divine or semi-divine beings interacting with Humanity often resulting in significant changes in society the Anunnaki are said to have had an important role in the creation and early history of humanity often portrayed as teachers or rulers in a similar manner the Fallen Angels in The Book of Enoch are said to have descended to Earth and had children with human women creating Nephilim and they also taught Humanity various forms of knowledge some which led to negative consequences in both mythologies these interactions can lead to transgressions against the divine order in subsequent punishments for example some interpretations of the myth of the apkalu the seven wise demigods suggest about the last of the akalu was considered evil barosis the Chaldean mentions these upkalu long before the discovery of the cuneiform tablets he says they are led by a god named oannis who was half fish and half man and taught Humanity the creation of the cosmos and how to make fire and weapons this is reflected in the Fallen Angels myth of the Watchers teaching humans how to make fire and weapons the Watchers in The Book of Enoch are portrayed as transgressing Divine boundaries by mating with human women and teaching Forbidden Knowledge actions which lead to their punishment and the great flood both sets of beings have a significant impact on human civilization the Anunnaki were seen as those who decreed the Fates and were involved in the establishment of Maintenance of civilization the Watchers through their transgressions fundamentally altered the course of human history bringing about a rise in Civilization and its eventual punishment and destruction through the flood the stories of the Anunnaki from Mesopotamian mythology and the Titans from Greek mythology are distinct and originated from different cultural historical contexts however like the Fallen Angels the Greek mythology has some parallels as well primarily in terms of power dynamics and generational conflicts among deities both the Anunnaki and the Titans are often associated with the primordial times in Mesopotamian mythology Anunnaki are among the earliest Gods linked with creation of the world and the establishment of civilization just as the Titans played the same role as they are replaced by the Olympian gods when Zeus overthrows Kronos just as the old gods are replaced by the new gods in Mesopotamian mythology foreign [Music] s and Hittites which flourished in the mid to late second millennium BC the oldest generation of gods was believed to have been banished by the younger gods to the underworld where they were ruled by the goddess lovewani hittite's scribes identified these deities with the Anunnaki an ancient horian the Anunnaki are referred to as Kerala shiannesh which means former ancient gods or katuresh shuanish which means gods of the earth hittite and Korean treaties were often sworn by the old gods in order to ensure that the oats would be kept in one myth the gods are threatened by the Stone Giant ulikumi so IA the later name for enki commands the former Gods to find the weapon that was used to separate the heavens from the Earth they find it and use it to cut off ulukumi's feet although the names of the Anunnaki and hurry and hittite texts frequently vary they are always eight in number similarly in Greek mythology the Titans are the children's of uranos heaven and Gaia Earth just as the Anunnaki are the children of Anu and Ki also Heaven and Earth in both mythologies there is a theme of conflict or tension between generations of Gods the Babylonian creation myth the enuma Elish tells of how the god Marduk on the younger generation defeats Tiamat an ancient goddess often associated with the Anunnaki and becomes the king of the Gods similarly in Greek mythology there's a titanomakia 10-year War were the Olympians the younger generation of gods overthrows the Titans the older generation both of these myths relate to the establishment of cosmic order and the allocation of divine roles after marudak's victory in the enuma-lish he creates the world and assigns roles to the gods after the Titans defeat in the titanomakia Zeus and his siblings divide the cosmos among themselves and establish their rule over the universe the mythology of the Anunnaki has indeed influenced later civilizations most notably acadians Babylonians Assyrians as well as the Hittites and the Greeks all of whom inherited much of sumer's cultural and religious Legacy these civilizations not only adopted the Anunnaki into their pantheons but also developed and transformed their myths over time a prominent example would be Marduk originally a minor God in the Sumerian Pantheon who was elevated by the Babylonians to the status of Chief deity marudak is often associated with Anu the Sumerian Sky God and in Lil who was initially considered the head of the Sumerian Pantheon the succession of the Gods like Zeus Kronos and uranos seems apparent throughout these cultures moreover the motif of a group of important deities deciding the fates can be seen in many other ancient near Eastern and Mediterranean mythologies such as Egyptian Greek and Roman pantheons while it's not a direct one-to-one correspondence these similarities suggest cultural exchanges and shared archetypal ideas in ancient civilizations the Nephilim are mentioned briefly in the Hebrew Bible specifically in the Book of Genesis 6 and numbers 13 their Origins and nature however are somewhat cryptic and have been the subject of much debate and speculation in Genesis the Nephilim are described as The Offspring of the sons of God and the daughters of humans the exact identity of these sons of God is not clear interpretations range from fallen angels to descendants of Seth Adam and Eve's third son while the daughters of humans are generally thought to refer to Mortal women the Nephilim are said to be the heroes of old Warriors of renown indicating their extraordinary strength or abilities they are often depicted as Giants especially in later Jewish or Christian tradition in the Book of Numbers the term Nephilim used again when the Israelites sends spies into Canaan and they report back so they brought the Israelites an unfavorable report of the land that they had spied out saying the land that we have gone through is spies is a land that devours its inhabitants and all the people that we saw in it are of great size there we saw the Nephilim the anakites come from Nephilim and ourselves we seemed like Grasshoppers and so we seem to them this passage is often interpreted to suggest that the Nephilim were giant beings but it's also possible that the term here is used more symbolically to describe formidable enemies the mysterious nature of the Nephilim have led to numerous interpretations and theories the term Nephilim comes from the Hebrew root nephil which means to fall therefore Nephilim is often translated as the Fallen ones this has led interpretations of the Nephilim as Fallen Angels or their offspring however the word could also be related to the Aramaic word nephil or Nephilim which means Giants reflecting the tradition of the Nephilim as giant beings and many later Jewish and Christian texts the terms ambiguity in the biblical text it's rare use and the various interpretive Traditions have led to many different translations and interpretations it's important to note that while we can make educated guesses based on linguistic and historical context the precise meaning of Nephilim in the Bible is not definitively known and even with these parallels it must also be stressed that the Anunnaki and the Nephilim are a part of two distinctive ancient cultural Traditions Mesopotamian and Hebrew there isn't a direct connection between the two in their original context if that was the case then why wouldn't the Hebrew authors just call them Anunnaki why call them Nephilim they are separate entities within their respective cultures and religious Traditions the Anunnaki were deities who in different Mesopotamian cultures held various roles from being the high gods of the pantheon to the Catholic underworld Deeds on the other hand the Nephilim according to the Hebrew Bible are The Offspring of the sons of God and the daughters of humans often depicted as Giants or Mighty Warriors the interpretation of the Anunnaki as deities of the ancient Sumerians acadines syrians and Babylonians and well-established historical and archaeological research however in recent years the Anunnaki have taken on a new life in the realm of pseudo-archeology conspiracy theories in science fiction for example the ancient astronaut theory proposed by Zechariah sitchin in his Earth Chronicles argues that the Anunnaki were actually a race of extraterrestrial beings from the planet Nibiru who visited Earth in search of gold over 400 000 years ago according to sichin these beings genetically engineered Homo sapiens as a worker race to mine gold Zacharias sitchin also posits that the Anunnaki were a race of extraterrestrial beings who visited Earth and genetically engineered humans for over a half a century biblical scholar and near East historian Zechariah sitchin devoted his life to proving the link between human beings and the Nephilim Giants mentioned in the Book of Genesis sitchin's research identifies them as Ancient Aliens known as the Annunaki who came to Earth from the planet Nibiru excuse me [Music] when the word in Hebrew is Nephilim coming from the root in the hall which means to come down to this end and then I was expecting complemented by the teacher where she said something like sit and sit down you don't question the Bible many of the seal Impressions that we have that are so significant to seeing how things were depicted in those days be it humans or Gods come from these envelopes well we have arrived at haran the city where Abraham dwelt with his father and brother and nephew it's important to emphasize that these interpretations are not accepted by mainstream historians archaeologists or experts in Mesopotamian mythology they are often criticized for a lack of rigorous scholarship misinterpretations of ancient texts and a Reliance on unsupported speculations here is Dr Joshua Bowen and a seriologist who has done several videos and wrote books on this subject I have links to these full videos and his book how to read Sumerian which is one of my go-to is my library yeah they have to keep this in mind when you number one when you when you look at Sumerian and what people are saying about Sumerian but uh you know in his book he does this all the time all the time and you know what it's it's sort of the equivalent to in a it's far worse but it's roughly equivalent to if you were to say butterfly right somebody a thousand years from now where you see the word butterfly and they would say ah this is a type of a stick that was kind of slippery and went on bread that was able to soar through the air butterfly nope no it's not um as it turns out as it turns out uh so he describes the gods as ancient astronauts then he discussion discusses at length the moo so what is the moo uh he argues that it's a fiery rocket and then finally uh he uses when humans flew to the heavens as an example so are several several examples of this to make his point so the gods is ancient astronauts so could the gods fly well he discusses the gods Zoo now those of you that have been with us for a while you're probably not familiar with the godzoo I was also not familiar with the Godzilla and I've been working on this for a while so but you know nenorta and you know that he engages with someone called anzu later he's depicted as a bird so he's definitely talking about anzu he uses what he says is a moo and mu to fly around so even though he's depicted as a bird it's almost like a metaphor nenorta kills him with tillem which are arrows and these are these arrows quote unquote were actually missiles that were fired into Zoo's moo continuing on he uses this statue from Mari that's he says is the goddess inanna there's absolutely nothing about this statue that suggests it's the goddess inanna it is a goddess he addresses the word for God Dinger he says that it's broken up into two parts din which means righteous Pure or bright gear which means a sharp object or also a two-stage rocket with fins I mean so here here's what I would say stitching consistently misunderstood mistranslated or at worst intentionally misrepresented the Sumerian and Acadian linguistic data it seems likely that he did not know Sumerian or Acadian if he did he made such basic and egregious errors with the language that one can only conclude that he was intentionally misleading his audience in either case sitchin brilliantly used the Mesopotamian literary Corpus and the lack of widespread familiarity with the texts and the languages to sell his books whether he did that intentionally or not you know it's I can't I can't get in his head while these theories of Fallen aliens might be shocking and compelling to some should be taken with a large grain of skepticism anything's possible but as it stands there is no empirical evidence or scholarly consensus that supports these claims they are generally viewed as Fringe theories outside of accepted academic discourse these ancient alien theories as it must be stressed they involve misinterpretations and mistranslations of the texts so we are going to look at chapter five which is called the Nephilim people of the fiery Rockets Josh who or what are the Nephilim yeah so the Nephilim are they appear in two different places um Genesis chapter six is the early uh the earliest as far as when it appears in the biblical text as it stands today and then uh in numbers 13. and the numbers one is probably the one to talk about first so in the Book of Numbers when the the spies go into the land and uh they they spy it out before they go in and uh 10 of them come back and they report there are giants in the land philim and uh so the Septuagint that's where it appears uh then it appears in Genesis chapter six Before the Flood story right is sort of the the backdrop to the the reason for the flood story and so the Nephilim there are parenthetically they're in a parenthetical phrase in the Hebrew sons of God come into the daughters of men they take wives they have offspring of these these giborim these uh these Great Men these Mighty Men and they call them anshay Hashem which is uh the men of literally the men of the name so it's pretty common common enough at least in Hebrew text and in the ancient Aries wider engineeries that this idea of the name would be like of prestige of um being known throughout perpetuity I'm emphasizing this because it comes up in the book he wants name to mean something very specific but anyhow uh stuck the chapter opens as it does with a quote from a Mesopotamian literary composition called dinana and shookaletuda in which the goddessa Nana is kind of soaring over the Earth and looking at all of the domain and then she lands in an orchard goes to sleep and is promptly raped by someone um he gets his comeuppance later on but the point of this is that the language sichin says shows very clearly that the goddess and Anna is flying and because she doesn't have wings she must be flying in a spaceship now can we just pause and let that sink in let's give it a moment of silence that is due such a statement the goddess the Divine being in the story goddess sorry not bad is flying in the text and since she doesn't have wings she must be flying in a rocket ship yep my Anunnaki brain does not compute Zechariah sitchin refers to various cuneiform texts the Port his idea of the planet Nibiru one key text he often cites is the enuma Lish the Babylonian Croatian epic sitchin suggests that references to a Celestial body called Marduk named after the Babylonian deity is actually referring to Nibiru in the enumerduck is portrayed as a Wandering planet that collides and splits Tiamat a primordial goddess associated with the sea in two sichin interprets Tiamat as a pre-existing Planet located between Mars and Jupiter He suggests that one half of Tiamat became the asteroid belt and the other was struck by another of marduk's moons and was pushed into a new orbit becoming Earth so let's move on uh to the May now I we've done a video on the May before um this is a very difficult complicated word and sichin says that the May is the spacesuit that we've already discussed that inanna probably wasn't wearing when she went to the underworld uh so sichin says um inanna he quotes Anana he doesn't give a text which is a pain in the ass it really is the lack of citation in this book makes you want to weep and then die sitchin's interpretation of the enuma Elish and his Association of Marduk with Nibiru is heavily criticized by Scholars mainstream's interpretation reads the enuma Elish as mythology and not literal astronomical account more connected with nature of the world rather than the nature of space furthermore sitchin's identification of Nibiru with Marduk is not supported in any cuneiform text that we know of the term Nibiru in the extent text is used to denote a point of Crossing and sometimes is associated with certain celestial bodies depending on their position in the sky but it's never described as the home of the Anunnaki nor as an additional planet in our solar system with an unusual orbit as suchin claims so the problem with this apart from taking a myth as literal facts and believing that the gods were actually aliens that genuinely came to Earth and genetically engineered or Humanity the problem with this is that the goddess and Anna is very often conceptualized as the planet Venus all the time it's very very common in Mesopotamia for Gods to be like not just associated with celestial bodies but they are those celestial bodies it's why judgments would take place outside before utu or shamash the Sun God because he was the god of judgment because as the sun the literal sun he saw everything that happened so he wouldn't know if you were telling the truth he would know if you were lying so Anana is not flying over the Earth in a rocket ship she is the Venus star where the Venus is the planet Venus oh wait up there yeah that's another system's theories and translations of Sumerian texts have drawn considerable criticism from professional scholars in the field some of the key points of contention from Dr Bowen and others who are proficient in the Sumerian language have pointed out numerous mistakes in his translations they argue that stitching appears to lack a solid understanding of Sumerian grammar syntax and vocabulary which leads him to create translations that deviates significantly from the accepted readings of these texts so he says the text quoted and they'll assigned to her this is Page 136 speech the text quoted envel is saying to her you have lifted the may you have tied the May to your hands you have gathered the mate you have attached the maid to your breast a queen of all the May o radiant light who with her hand grasps the seven name so why we translate singular for all of those is bizarre I'm particularly in light of the last one the seven May these These are these are okay sorry it's like moose you know Mason sorry Little Brian Regan throw it in there I want to give props so please translate well he's not translating maybe he's making an argument that they may are um a collection of objects that one puts on oneself in order to travel into space and that makes sense in what he's saying because um that's a weird sentence coming out of your mouth no there's some internal logic here um it makes sense here because he's saying that inanna is putting on all of this gear in order to go and visit on who lives in the sky because he's a sky God and that's generally speaking where they reside so in order to go and see Anne she has to get her space suit on and then get in her spacecraft and go up into the sky the problem with this again one one of many the problem with this is that the may actually have names there are more than seven of them it depends what text you're reading but in a lot of cases there are more than seven of them many many more many many more um and in one of the texts where inanna gets on a boat not a spaceship you will notice she gets on a boat so she's going to see Yankee she goes up she sees Anki she gets him grindingly drunk he falls asleep and then she steals the mace so in some cases they're really abstract Concepts like righteousness and awe and in other cases they are things that you could probably pick up and hold uh like the noble sector staff and crook the noble dress um but then that's paired with championship and kingship section is often accused taking ancient texts out of context in imposing his own interpretations on them for instance he refers to the Anunnaki actual extraterrestrial beings sitchin claims that the Sumerians knew of an extra Planet Beyond Neptune called Nibiru which has a long elliptical orbit around the sun he never provides the source for this or what text he's referring to according to sitchin the Sumerians believe that the Anunnaki came from this planet however Scholars point out that the term Nibiru is just used for a Celestial point of Crossing or a large Celestial body and there's no text that identifies Nibiru as an ancient home for the Anunnaki you see how that works people when we say something we try to back it up with a citation you know any of the citronites that are listening that want to defend their position this is what's useful you don't as decision has done just provide a translation and don't tell them what text is from traditionally you give a text if you have it you give a tablet number so we can go and look at the actual tablet you're citing a line number um whether it's on the obverse or the reverse of the tablet because they did right on both sides this is how it's normally done in responsible scholarships so that people can go track down your evidence for themselves and assess your arguments properly he often contradicts the consensus and his theories are never published in peer-reviewed academic journals process that ensures scholarly accuracy and reliability instead he chooses the self-published route lastly sitchin's theories lack empirical evidence he makes significant claims about Advanced Technologies genetic engineering and Architectural capabilities of ancient civilizations based on his interpretations of text but doesn't provide archaeological or physical evidence to substantiate these claims ancient astronaut theory often relies on questionable interpretations of ancient texts in the case of sitchin's work Sumerian texts describe Anunnaki as extraterrestrials from a hypothetical planet such as translations of these texts do not have anything in common with anything in Sumerian mythology and are heavily influenced by modern sci-fi films and books the ancient astronaut theory poses that the Anunnaki genetically engineered humans to mine gold and that they built sophisticated technology and structures like the pyramids and that these are not tombs but also advanced technology there's a lack of empirical evidence to support any of these claims if such Advanced Technologies were used in ancient times we would expect to find physical remnants or unambiguous depictions of this technology in ancient artifacts and primary sources no such evidence has been found Theory reflects a modern bias that ancient civilizations lack the capability to build Monumental architecture or develop complex societies on their own this underestimates the capability of our ancestors archaeologists have demonstrated that ancient societies had the knowledge skills and organization to construct Monumental architecture and develop complex civilizations without the need for extraterrestrial invention these ancient astronaut theorists tend to operate outside the standard methodologies and principles of historical and archaeological research often prioritizing Sensational interpretations over more plausible ones tend to dismiss contrary evidence this approach does not follow the principles of scientific inquiry which require hypotheses to be based on empirical evidence and to be testable and falsifiable while the ancient astronauts Theory might be intriguing does not hold up under scrutiny the Anunnaki is understood by mainstream historians and archaeologists we deities in the ancient Mesopotamian Pantheon not extraterrestrial beings our understanding of the Anunnaki like many aspects of Egypt civilization is continually refined through ongoing scholarly research and archaeological discovery [Music] and that deer explorers concludes our thrilling journey into the ancient world of the Anunnaki and the Nephilim two intriguing chapters from the vast book
