"Established in 1600 BC the Shang Dynasty marked the golden age of early Chinese civilization ancient China emerges in\nthe light of history for the first time Shown in the written records that remain\nthe Shang Dynasty spanned over 500 years and the kings like many rulers of the\nancient world kept control by constantly waging war one of the monarchs who grew\nup among the common folk led the Shang to its pinnacle he was deemed the 23rd\nking of the Shang Dynasty in his early years\nWu Ding was sent to experience the life of an ordinary citizen by his father no\none at his new home knew that he would one day be their king eventually Wu\nDing reached the age of marriage at the time kings of the Shang would cultivate\nthe allegiance of neighbouring tribes through marriage Alliance what kind of\nwoman will I marry Wu Ding wondered Then came the day of Wu Ding's big\nmarriage When the wedding procession reached the palace Wu Ding saw his\nbride for the first time it was Fu Hao a princess from a neighboring tribe\nshe's so beautiful Wu Ding thought to himself Their days together after\nmarriage were very happy but gradually Wu Ding found the queen by his side to\nbe different from other women According to writings in ancient tones Fu Hao\nceased all speech and laughter upon hearing thunder to show reverence to the\ngods although she would be surprised that the sound her calm demeanor would\nnot waver When Wu Ding ascended to the throne the Shang\nDynasty strength was on the decline with Many internal and external factors\nthreatening the stability of the empire When an enemy invasion came from the\nnorth the border guards repeatedly sent urgent messages to the capital\nrequesting aid Wu Ding was worried because he could not find a general who\ncould turn things around unexpectedly Fu Hao stood in front of Wu Ding dressed\nin full battle armor she appealed to the king to let her lead a military campaign\nagainst the invaders although Fu Hao demonstrated unusual\ncourage and received military training since she was young Wu Ding was\nhesitant to send his beloved wife to the ferocious battle but under Fu Hao's\npersistence Wu Ding decided to conduct a divination The result of the\ndivination revealed that it was auspicious for Fu Hao to join the war\nthus Wu Ding accepted Fu Hao's request without further delay As soon as she entered the battlefield\nFu Hao reveals her outstanding military talent the enemy was badly defeated and\nnever again rose to challenge the Shang The bronze Yue (or battle Axe) in the Shang Dynasty was not an ordinary weapon but rather a symbol of military power it is\nbelieved that the larger the Yue size is the more power the owner wields in\n1976 two large bronze Yue with the inscription Fu Hao were unearthed in\nthe Yin ruins the largest Yue is about 40 centimeters long 38 centimeters wide\nand weighs 9 kilograms It is engraved with an exquisite pair of twin Tigers\neating a human head motif radiating with an aura of authority Around the 13th century BC\nShangqiu a city of the Shang was attacked by the Yinfang Wu Ding led Fu\nHao to defend Shangqiu after arriving on the battlefield\nWu Ding decided to launch an assault in the middle of the night Fu Hao didn't\njoin him instead she quietly left the front lines Alone Wu Ding led a fierce\ncharge against Yinfang's forces Yinfang's front lines were broken They fled from Wu Ding\u2019s pursuing forces and eventually arrived at a quiet valley but\nbefore Yinfang's army could catch their breath Shang his flag submerged above\nthem at the top of the valley there were two big characters written on the flags\n\"Fu Hao\" Faced with the enemy soldiers on both\nsides Yinfang's troops were thrown into disarray before long the whole army was\nwiped out The Queen was the first general in\nChina's written history to apply ambush tactics in war But this was not Fu\nHao's greatest accomplishment During the third millennium BC a group of steppe pastoralists - the Indo-Europeans started a massive migration to find new\npassengers in which their animals could graze Like most pastoralist peoples\nthroughout history they were fiercely warlike and would conquer kill or drive\noff the lands earlier inhabitants in order to use their fields\nthe first advanced civilization of Europe the Minoan civilization was\nshattered One of the greatest civilizations in history the Chinese\ncivilization was also driven to the brink of extinction the group of\nindo-european invaders which migrated southward into China was known as the\ntribe of Qiangfang They invaded from the northwest of Shang when Wu Ding was\nbattling against another tribe in the east The attack from Qiangfang became a\nbig threat to Shang's army Wu Ding was placed in a perilous position Fu Hao\nwas very worried but she declined the idea of immediately sending off the\nlimited military power remaining instead she walked into prison With several thousands criminal recruits\nand the remaining Shang soldiers Fu Hao commanded a united force of over 13,000\npeople into the battlefield The criminal recruits fought hard the invaders were\nterrified by their fierce attack turned on their heels and ran This was the\nlargest battle fought during King Wu Ding's reign who how who saved the\ncivilization became known as the goddess of war One of the most important state affairs\nin the Shang Dynasty was military issues what was even more important was the\nworship of gods and ancestors and performing divination in attempts to\npredict the future The ancient kings would inscribe their name and the date\nof the divination on a bone along with a question They would then heat the bone\nuntil it cracked and then interpret the shape of the crack which was believed to\nprovide an answer to their question The questions and results of the divination\nwould be carved into oracle bones after the ceremony They were stored and\nregarded as interactive letters between the kings and the gods Fu Hao's name appeared over 250 times\nin oracle inscriptions carved on bones and turtle shells inside Shang tomb\nAcross 3,000 years of change and turmoil these inscriptions proclaim the King's\nunceasing affection for his most favored queen Fu Hao's existence is said to be one\nof the auspicious portents bestowed upon Wu Ding and the Shang people the\nassisted booting in many military campaigns had massively expanded the\nShang territory thus Wu Ding's reign marked the time when the Shang Dynasty\nwas most powerful then Fu Hao quietly departed having accomplished the Mandate\nof Heaven Some speculated that true how was exhausted from fighting wars others\nthought her health had gradually worsened after giving birth Fu Hao died\nyoung at the age of 33 who ding was devastated and could not accept his\nqueens passing On oracle bones, Wu Ding wrote:\" Fu\nHao is still here isn't she?\" \u201cCan Fu Hao delay her death?\u201d \u201cHas she left?\u201d Even after her death he asked the gods can I sacrifice 10 cows as a\ntribute to Fu Hao After Fu Hao passed away Wu Ding had her buried in an area\nwithin his palace instead of the normal royal tomb areas so that she could stay\nbeside him and watch over her country every day and night In the year 1976 a lavish tomb was found in Xiaotun village located in the Henan province of China The owner of the tomb\nwas a lady The luxury of the burial items reflects her uncommonly high\nsocial status Through the veil of history we see a\ncharming figure doing her hair in front of the mirror over three millennia ago "
