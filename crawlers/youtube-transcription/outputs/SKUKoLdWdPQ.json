"Sponsored by nordvpn Let's take a look at a map of some key Asian\u00a0\narchaeological sites that are between 100 and\u00a0\u00a0 200,000 years old, roughly. A time period\u00a0\ncalled the middle to late pleistocene. A\u00a0\u00a0 cold time in the earth's climate.\u00a0\nA period of frequent glaciations,\u00a0\u00a0 woolly mammoths, the whole\u00a0\nshebang. It's the Ice Age. Over in modern Israel and Palestine you have\u00a0\nSkhul and Qafzeh caves. Humming with the activity\u00a0\u00a0 of homo sapiens. Groups like these were probably\u00a0\nhunting and fishing along the shores of an ancient\u00a0\u00a0 lake, now the Nefud desert in Saudi Arabia.\u00a0\nLeaving behind nothing but their footprints. North and east in modern Iraq and Iran\u00a0\nneanderthals are making their home in\u00a0\u00a0 Shanidar cave and the Zagros Mountains. Hunting\u00a0\nwild goats, which can't have been easy, for sure.\u00a0\u00a0 Further east in the mountains of Uzbekistan,\u00a0\u00a0 Teshik Tash cave became the final resting\u00a0\nplace of this young Neanderthal child. To the north of here neanderthals and\u00a0\ndenisovans occupied Denisova cave,\u00a0\u00a0 sometimes on their own sometimes\u00a0\ntogether evolutionary cousins\u00a0\u00a0 raising hybrid families. Though they almost\u00a0\ncertainly didn't think about it like that,\u00a0\u00a0 I would bet. Denisovans lived further east too,\u00a0\naccording to the proteins recovered from this jaw\u00a0\u00a0 found in Baishiya Karst cave. Breathing\u00a0\nin the thin air of the Tibetan plateau. In warmer climates though, tucked away on the\u00a0\nisland of java, Homo erectus was still living\u00a0\u00a0 along the Solo River. No doubt living a similar\u00a0\nlife to their ancestors who entered the region\u00a0\u00a0 well over a million years before. Probably unaware\u00a0\nthat they were just over the seas from two other\u00a0\u00a0 groups of hominin, Homo floresiensis and Homo\u00a0\nluazonensis, from Flores and Luzon respectively. As you can see this is a really incredible\u00a0\nmoment in the evolution of our species,\u00a0\u00a0 there's just so much going on, so\u00a0\nmany different forms of hominin\u00a0\u00a0 leading slightly different lives in in\u00a0\ndifferent regions, all Around the World. In between all of these finds, all these\u00a0\nvarious forms of ancient human sits\u00a0\u00a0 South Asia. Modern India, Pakistan, Nepal,\u00a0\nBangladesh, Sri Lanka. So who lived there? For the past three months I've\u00a0\nbeen working away at this problem,\u00a0\u00a0 reading paper after paper, interviewing experts\u00a0\nfrom different fields, and uh it's complicated,\u00a0\u00a0 it's really complicated. I think South Asia\u00a0\nis often sidelined in discussions of human\u00a0\u00a0 evolution. For some reason it just doesn't\u00a0\nget the same attention as Africa or Europe\u00a0\u00a0 or southeast Asia but I have come to believe that\u00a0\nit is in many ways the most interesting region. A\u00a0\u00a0 region that gives us a real insight into just\u00a0\nhow messy and convoluted human evolution was. Obviously the first line of evidence we\u00a0\nhave when we're trying to discuss who\u00a0\u00a0 was living in a specific region, what kind of\u00a0\nhuman, what kind of hominin are the fossils,\u00a0\u00a0 the literal remains of humans that\u00a0\nlived in that place in that time,\u00a0\u00a0 and this is what makes studying\u00a0\nSouth Asia so challenging. Hominins have lived in the region for probably\u00a0\ntwo million years, maybe even 2.6 million years\u00a0\u00a0 and yet from that early time down through\u00a0\nto when modern Homo sapiens arrived. We\u00a0\u00a0 only have one cranium, one fossil. The\u00a0\nNarmada cranium. Fortunately for me\u00a0\u00a0 and this video I got to chat to Professor\u00a0\nSheela Athreya who's studied it in depth. [Stefan] okay let me share\u00a0\nmy screen here so we can see,\u00a0\u00a0 so yep, so who is this who are we looking at here? [Sheela] We are looking at a hominin\u00a0\nfrom the pleistocene in central India\u00a0\u00a0 and those are the three most definitive\u00a0\nthings that I can say about it. [Stefan narration] At 1300 kilometers long\u00a0\nthe Narmada is India's fifth longest river.\u00a0\u00a0 The source of the River springs from the\u00a0\nground at the Narmada Kund temple in Madhya\u00a0\u00a0 Pradesh before winding its way down through\u00a0\nthe mountains, into the state of Gujarat,\u00a0\u00a0 and out into the Indian Ocean. On December\u00a0\n5th 1982, outside the village of Hathnora,\u00a0\u00a0 Arun Sonakia unearthed the only archaic human\u00a0\nremains found in South Asia. Unfortunately the\u00a0\u00a0 skull was found in a secondary deposit which\u00a0\nmeans the river had washed it away from its\u00a0\u00a0 original location and deposited it elsewhere, so\u00a0\nit's been removed from its original context and as\u00a0\u00a0 a result the date range for this skull is really\u00a0\nquite broad, between 46 and 236,000 years old. [Stefan] Even though it's the only fossil\u00a0\nthat we have, it's a sample size of one,\u00a0\u00a0 I think we are fortunate it does\u00a0\nseem to be a really interesting\u00a0\u00a0 fossil though there does seem\u00a0\nto be a lot going on with it. [Sheela] Yeah that's definitely fair to say. I\u00a0\nmean one of the uh the first morphometric study\u00a0\u00a0 of it that, you know, did a complete statistical\u00a0\nmultivariate statistical analysis of the specimen\u00a0\u00a0 by Kenneth Kennedy at Cornell University,\u00a0\ndemonstrated that it has one of the highest\u00a0\u00a0 cranial heights and that's measured from the\u00a0\nbase of the cranium at a point called basion\u00a0\u00a0 at the back of the foramen magnum, up to the top\u00a0\nof the cranium. It has one of the highest basion\u00a0\u00a0 bregma heights, so one of the highest crania\u00a0\nof, if it's a homo erectus of homo erectus,\u00a0\u00a0 it's outside the range actually. But at the same\u00a0\ntime you can see it has a very sloping frontal\u00a0\u00a0 bone behind those big brow ridges and it has um a\u00a0\nvery rounded kind of angular back of the cranium.\u00a0\u00a0 So living humans have a more vertical back of\u00a0\nthe cranium and that's what makes our skulls\u00a0\u00a0 look so round and this one, even though it's\u00a0\ngot very rounded features at the top which do\u00a0\u00a0 make it seem globular, at the back it's still\u00a0\nangular which is more like Homo erectus. This\u00a0\u00a0 individual is inferred to be a female but that's\u00a0\nthat's based on a limited reference sample, it is\u00a0\u00a0 assuming that there are more robust individuals\u00a0\nout there and then this is less robust. [Stefan narration] The cranial capacity is also\u00a0\nwithin the range of modern humans, the average of\u00a0\u00a0 different estimates works out to about 1288 cubic\u00a0\ncentimeters which is basically the average for a\u00a0\u00a0 modern woman now. So where does narmada fit on our\u00a0\nevolutionary tree, approximately, you know these\u00a0\u00a0 things are nuanced but where approximately\u00a0\ndoes it fit on our evolutionary tree? [Sheela] If we treat treat the African Homo\u00a0\nerectus as one group and we treat the Asian Homo\u00a0\u00a0 erectus as a completely separate group and the\u00a0\nEuropeans as a third group, Narmada is not typical\u00a0\u00a0 of any of them. But it's not so different that we\u00a0\nwant to come up with yet another species name, and\u00a0\u00a0 so when the analyses are run that both the African\u00a0\nand Asian specimens from a certain time period\u00a0\u00a0 are called Homo erectus, Narmada the fits right,\u00a0\nin it has some African and some Asian features. [James] But also just thinking about\u00a0\nhow how you might have interactions\u00a0\u00a0 between adjacent populations South Asia is\u00a0\nkind of interesting, because to the West\u00a0\u00a0 it can get cut off during arid phases\u00a0\nbecause the deserts. It's very difficult\u00a0\u00a0 to move east west. On the Eastern\u00a0\nside you've got the other problem,\u00a0\u00a0 you've got some of the wettest landscapes in\u00a0\nthe world and when they get wetter that must\u00a0\u00a0 be very difficult, you've got mountainous\u00a0\nreally humid forest to try and traverse,\u00a0\u00a0 but those areas might be accessible during more\u00a0\narid phases. So you've got this pulse , when you\u00a0\u00a0 know when you might have interactions from either\u00a0\nside and that could fit well with what Sheela\u00a0\u00a0 would suggest of that oh actually you've got\u00a0\nsome some Western contact some Eastern contact. [Stefan] What do you think that says about\u00a0\nSouth Asia's position in our human evolution? [Sheela] You know the title of the paper I\u00a0\nthink South Asia was a geographic crossroads\u00a0\u00a0 the other thing I think it says is more\u00a0\nabout how we partition variation. And so\u00a0\u00a0 if we partition variation based on the\u00a0\ngeographic um you know, things that are\u00a0\u00a0 very geographically disparate. We're going\u00a0\nto say lo and behold they are very different\u00a0\u00a0 and if you ignore all the all the population\u00a0\nareas, so South Asia and Central Asia,\u00a0\u00a0 um then your you know your models are obviously\u00a0\nlacking something but you're also missing the\u00a0\u00a0 point of what we're supposed to be studying\u00a0\nwhich is how did humans vary in the past,\u00a0\u00a0 I think that's what we're supposed to be\u00a0\nstudying, I don't think we're supposed to\u00a0\u00a0 be asking how many categories were there\u00a0\nin the past. What we should be asking,\u00a0\u00a0 what is interesting to ask, if we really want\u00a0\nto understand the evolutionary history of humans\u00a0\u00a0 isn't the labels again, it's the processes\u00a0\nwhat are that evolutionary processes that\u00a0\u00a0 are shaping us, right? To me that's more\u00a0\nfascinating. I would love to know what\u00a0\u00a0 environmental and climatic factors, maybe even\u00a0\ntechnological factors, raw material availability,\u00a0\u00a0 subsistence patterns, what were the things that\u00a0\nwere shaping these populations in the past? [Stefan] So there we go, the only human cranium\u00a0\nfrom the middle pleistocene in South Asia really\u00a0\u00a0 shows it to be a bridge between two groups of\u00a0\ndistant hominins, what's going on in Africa,\u00a0\u00a0 what's going on in in East Asia. It's\u00a0\nmix of features East and West, modern,\u00a0\u00a0 archaic really resists an easy classification and\u00a0\nthat's probably the point we should be taking away\u00a0\u00a0 from it. Whoever lived in South Asia during the\u00a0\nmiddle pleistocene was really at a crossroads\u00a0\u00a0 both in in time and geography. They're\u00a0\ngoing to be influenced by a lot of factors,\u00a0\u00a0 some of them external but also some of them\u00a0\ninternal, this was no evolutionary dead end. With only one fossil we have to look elsewhere\u00a0\nfor Clues as to what was going down in South Asia. Naturally, this being the Stone Age we're\u00a0\ngoing to look at stone tools. Now assigning\u00a0\u00a0 stone tools to a particular hominin in\u00a0\nthe absence of fossils is really tough,\u00a0\u00a0 absolutely fraught with nuance but we\u00a0\ncan paint with some really broad strokes. In this middle Pleistocene there are two\u00a0\nfamilies of tools that really stand out.\u00a0\u00a0 The first are Achulean stone tools,\u00a0\nthe absolute classic achelean artifact\u00a0\u00a0 are these large bifacial hand axes,\u00a0\nbut they did also produce cleavers,\u00a0\u00a0 they did also use flakes, but the\u00a0\nhand axe is really characteristic. Early examples start to appear around\u00a0\n1.75 million years ago in Africa and\u00a0\u00a0 are associated with the evolution of bigger\u00a0\nbrained hominins like Homo erectus and later\u00a0\u00a0 homo heidalbergensis. That's family\u00a0\nnumber one, that's the Acheulean. The next family of stone tools the next\u00a0\ndevelopment occurred between 400 and 200,000\u00a0\u00a0 years ago these are called middle Paleolithic\u00a0\ntools. The idea here is that now flakes are\u00a0\u00a0 the star of the show. The knapper would create\u00a0\na striking platform on the bottom of the rock,\u00a0\u00a0 they would then shape the core to create the\u00a0\noutline of a tool, then with one precise bosh\u00a0\u00a0 the perfectly shaped flake is removed and now\u00a0\nyou have your spear point or whatever you wanted.\u00a0\u00a0 Archaeologists call this the levallois\u00a0\ntechnique and it's associated with the\u00a0\u00a0 evolution of homo sapiens, neanderthals\u00a0\nand denisovans. Multiple groups used them.\u00a0\u00a0 These changes may seem kind of small to\u00a0\nus but as archaeologist Gopesh Jah and\u00a0\u00a0 James Blinkhorn will explain, these are legit\u00a0\ntechnological breakthroughs, no doubt about it. [James] To explain and particularly\u00a0\nthis shift from Acheulean technology\u00a0\u00a0 to accomplish levallois and middle politic\u00a0\ntechnology. Acheulean tools are bifaces,\u00a0\u00a0 you can imagine it a bit more like a sculpture,\u00a0\nin that you start off your block of marble,\u00a0\u00a0 you chip things away until you realize this is\u00a0\nthe shape that I wanted in the end. Whereas,\u00a0\u00a0 you're doing a lot of that shaping of levallois\u00a0\ntechnology but then you've got this one final\u00a0\u00a0 strike which is make or break it, into the thing\u00a0\nthat you're you've been preparing towards. So it's\u00a0\u00a0 cognitively more complex to do that, you've got to\u00a0\nthink the steps in advance and all the different\u00a0\u00a0 parameters you can control, but it gives you a lot\u00a0\nmore control of the shape and size of the flake\u00a0\u00a0 that you're removing. Presumably because that's\u00a0\ndesirable for the tool that you want to make. [Gopesh] and throughout the middle pleistocene\u00a0\nyou have so many industries where people are\u00a0\u00a0 shifting from this heavy tools to the lighter\u00a0\ntools, and that may have something to do with\u00a0\u00a0 localized adaptation. Like when there is a\u00a0\nhuge scarcity of resources, I don't want to\u00a0\u00a0 travel with these huge artifacts. I I want to\u00a0\nbe more efficient in terms of adaptation and\u00a0\u00a0 hence I rather focus on these smaller flakes than\u00a0\nthese heavy artifacts and these smaller flakes\u00a0\u00a0 can be of an amount of types like that made in\u00a0\ndifferent technique, this and that, this and that. [Stefan] Okay let's look at some South Asian stone\u00a0\ntools. These are stone tools from Attirampakkam,\u00a0\u00a0 these are argued to be middle Paleolithic tools,\u00a0\nthose levallois stone tools. These are cores that\u00a0\u00a0 have had flakes removed. In the middle here we've\u00a0\ngot these levallois points and at the bottom here\u00a0\u00a0 we've still got some hand axes being produced.\u00a0\nWhat's so tantalizing about Attirampakkam is that\u00a0\u00a0 the oldest layer where these stone tools have\u00a0\nbeen excavated dates to 385,000 years ago which\u00a0\u00a0 is extremely old. Making it one of the oldest\u00a0\nmiddle Paleolithic sites in the entire world,\u00a0\u00a0 maybe even the oldest middle Paleolithic site in\u00a0\nthe entire world. These are some more stone tools\u00a0\u00a0 from slightly further north in Andhra Pradesh,\u00a0\napologies for almost certainly saying that wrong.\u00a0\u00a0 Again here we've got some cores here, G and H\u00a0\nsome levallois points. C, D, E and F are again\u00a0\u00a0 hand axes, that tradition is still going on here.\u00a0\nQuick note here though, notice how E and F are\u00a0\u00a0 very small hand axes, that's going to be important\u00a0\nlater. These all date to 247,000 years ago. So there you go we have very early\u00a0\nlevallois technology in South Asia\u00a0\u00a0 probably made by a hominin that was\u00a0\nlike us Homo sapiens, like neanderthals,\u00a0\u00a0 like denisovans. The hard thing is without human\u00a0\nremains we can't really say much more than that. [James] There's absolutely no reason why,\u00a0\nyou know, the middle middle pleistocene\u00a0\u00a0 homo population that we've got at Narmada is\u00a0\nbroadly similar to Neanderthals to denisovans,\u00a0\u00a0 and to my mind probably not that different from\u00a0\nHomo sapiens either. So probably under the right\u00a0\u00a0 circumstances would have would be in a position\u00a0\nto innovate similar sorts of technologies. [Stefan narration] As you can see though\u00a0\nthese industries are kind of transitional\u00a0\u00a0 there's still some Acheulean tools being\u00a0\nproduced alongside middle Paleolithic tools.\u00a0\u00a0 This suggests that this is really a local\u00a0\ninnovation, independent innovation going\u00a0\u00a0 on down here in South Asia. But how long that\u00a0\ntransition lasted and the factors influencing\u00a0\u00a0 it is uh subject to huge debate because the\u00a0\npicture is actually even more complicated. [Stefan] Do the Acheulean and the middle\u00a0\nPaleolithic overlap for a long time in South Asia? [James] Yeah, yeah that's one of the key areas\u00a0\nwhere South Asia is really quite weird. It's\u00a0\u00a0 got the youngest Acheulean industries in the\u00a0\nworld. So in East Eastern Africa it's at Mieso\u00a0\u00a0 around 214,000 years ago is the youngest latest\u00a0\nAcheulean there. In Arabia you see something\u00a0\u00a0 slightly younger around Dawadmi it's 170, 180\u00a0\nuh. At Bamburi and Patpara in the middle of Son\u00a0\u00a0 Valley uh, which is in central India, you're\u00a0\ndating to 140 to 120,000 years ago. So that's,\u00a0\u00a0 you know a hundred thousand years ago\u00a0\nafter it's disappeared from Eastern Africa. [Stefan Narration] So we have a site\u00a0\nwith the earliest examples of middle\u00a0\u00a0 Paleolithic technology, other sites\u00a0\nwith the youngest examples of Acheulean\u00a0\u00a0 technology. What kind of forces\u00a0\ncould have driven this variation ? [James] So and I think one of the things that\u00a0\nkind of muddies this issue and even, again I'll\u00a0\u00a0 probably refer quite a lot to Eastern Africa\u00a0\nhere but actually even in the young Acheulean,\u00a0\u00a0 like some of the most recent Acheulean in Eastern\u00a0\nAfrica you find the appearance of levallois\u00a0\u00a0 Technology, this key key aspect of the middle\u00a0\npaleolithic, but often in low frequencies compared\u00a0\u00a0 to this focus on bifacial technology which is\u00a0\nstill the dominant aspect of the assemblage. At\u00a0\u00a0 some point that's that switches, so it's not just,\u00a0\nit's not always just a presence or absence sort of\u00a0\u00a0 argument is my point. Sometimes it's proportional\u00a0\nwith reference to the assemblage that it's in. [Stefan narration] The existence of\u00a0\nthese two technologies alongside each\u00a0\u00a0 other for such a long time is challenging though. [James] and this is where the findings from\u00a0\nAttirampakkam kind of jar with that otherwise\u00a0\u00a0 quite simple model as it's suggesting that\u00a0\nthere's perhaps within the region what 250,000\u00a0\u00a0 years of overlap between Acheulean technology\u00a0\nand middle paleolithic technology yeah um [Stefan] which is just such a colossal,\u00a0\nit's easy to get lost in the numbers,\u00a0\u00a0 but that's such a colossal amount of time. [James] I mean uh it's almost as long as we\u00a0\nwould, you know, recognize our species to exist,\u00a0\u00a0 existed for, that there could have\u00a0\nbeen this overlap, which is is huge\u00a0\u00a0 and it I find it difficult, I\u00a0\nfind that difficult to explain. [Stefan narration] My first instinct upon\u00a0\nlearning that there was two different\u00a0\u00a0 technological traditions surviving\u00a0\nfor a long time alongside each other\u00a0\u00a0 was that there was multiple\u00a0\ndifferent hominins producing them. [James] I don't see the immediate need to jump\u00a0\nthat they must be different populations doing\u00a0\u00a0 that. um I think that's partly because, you\u00a0\nknow, without either genetics or some fossils\u00a0\u00a0 to go on we can keep on populating with more and\u00a0\nmore different hominins if we like. So for me,\u00a0\u00a0 it's why was it happening down on the south\u00a0\neast, and why didn't it spread elsewhere and\u00a0\u00a0 that's that question of was it a was it really\u00a0\nan enduring thing, that always persisted there\u00a0\u00a0 or was it momentary and related\u00a0\nto some very specific conditions? [Stefan narration] Climate\u00a0\nand environment obviously\u00a0\u00a0 two huge factors that could have played a role. [Gopesh] So India or South Asia comes under\u00a0\nthis school called oriental z,one Oriental okay\u00a0\u00a0 which is which has just so many pockets of natural\u00a0\nresources which are evergreen, okay. In a way like\u00a0\u00a0 even when there's certain kind of a table turning\u00a0\nenvironmental shift is happening around the globe,\u00a0\u00a0 becoming super arid conditions but you always\u00a0\nhave these pockets which can support hominin\u00a0\u00a0 populations and India has, not India I would say\u00a0\nsouth Asia, has multiple set of these pockets.\u00a0\u00a0 We are not traveling for sake of traveling, we\u00a0\nare traveling in search of resources or better\u00a0\u00a0 habitats but when you have one which supports\u00a0\nyour needs, which nourishes you, caters you\u00a0\u00a0 what you seek, which you don't need to go far off\u00a0\nregions. You can be or you can build that cocoon\u00a0\u00a0 or ecological cocoon where you grow and grow\u00a0\nand grow and does not have to be in contact. [Stefan narration]as I said at the start Homo\u00a0\nerectus was still around at this time one hundred\u00a0\u00a0 thousand years ago on Java. But that's sort of\u00a0\neasy to explain because Java is so tucked away\u00a0\u00a0 on the southeast of Eurasia. It wasn't an island\u00a0\nat this time but it's still extremely remote,\u00a0\u00a0 extremely mountainous region. So their survival\u00a0\nin that area is sort of simple to explain in a\u00a0\u00a0 way. But explaining the Persistence of Acheulean\u00a0\ntechnologies in South Asia uh is more difficult. [James] uh because when you note 250,000 years\u00a0\nof overlap or potential overlap between middle\u00a0\u00a0 paleolithic in the southeast and late Acheulean in\u00a0\nkind of north and west, what was separating them? Even after the disappearance\u00a0\nof Acheulean it doesn't get\u00a0\u00a0 any easier to untangle what's going on.\u00a0\nArchaeologist Praveen Kumar talked me\u00a0\u00a0 through some of the most important sites at\u00a0\nthis time one hundred thousand years ago. [Praveen] That is the middle Son valley,\u00a0\nright now I'm working in this area,\u00a0\u00a0 this eastern part of the India. [Stefan narration] Sites like Sandhav, which has\u00a0\npretty good evidence of a homo sapiens population. [Praveen] it's an interesting Discovery\u00a0\nfrom the Sandhav because tanged point\u00a0\u00a0 is in Africa North Africa, Aterian points\u00a0\nare actually associated with modern humans. [Stefan narration] The tanged points\u00a0\nthat Praveen and others excavated here\u00a0\u00a0 at Sandhav called Aterian points are\u00a0\nespecially interesting because at the\u00a0\u00a0 same time they're found across North\u00a0\nAfrica and are associated with modern\u00a0\u00a0 Homo sapiens. Could this population also have\u00a0\nbeen present at the same time in South Asia? [Praveen] Yeah so in in Western India\u00a0\nand coastal region this time discovery\u00a0\u00a0 of this tanged point uh a date, the date\u00a0\nof this tanged point is very interesting.\u00a0\u00a0 So this tanged point is byproduct of modern\u00a0\nhuman? I I don't know it's it's big question? [Stefan narration] This point is great\u00a0\nevidence of homo sapiens in South Asia\u00a0\u00a0 at that time but at other locations middle\u00a0\nPaleolithic assemblages still have small\u00a0\u00a0 diminutive bifaces, just like the ones from\u00a0\nAndhra Pradesh that was 247,000 years old. The youngest of these diminutive bifaces was found\u00a0\u00a0 just down the road from Sandhav\u00a0\nand dates to 69,000 years old. [Gopesh] it's 69 kilo years [Stefan]oh wow that's really young [Gopesh] 1.5 to 69. yeah that's\u00a0\nwhat we are talking about. [Stefan]damn. I think the real archeology nerds in my\u00a0\naudience out here can see why this region\u00a0\u00a0 is so interesting. At every single step\u00a0\nit just forbids us from forming any simple\u00a0\u00a0 conclusion. It's like oh we have Aterian\u00a0\npoints so homo sapiens are in the region,\u00a0\u00a0 right? Well maybe but somebody's also\u00a0\nstill producing bifaces and they're found\u00a0\u00a0 alongside middle Paleolithic tools. It's just\u00a0\na it's just so complex, I absolutely love it. There's probably only one technology which is\u00a0\u00a0 really going to help us get to\u00a0\ngrips with all this diversity. Okay this paper is what started my whole obsession\u00a0\nmy whole South Asian rabbit hole, deep dive,\u00a0\u00a0 'Using hominin integration to trace modern human\u00a0\ndispersals'. Basically using evidence of archaic\u00a0\u00a0 genetics in modern populations, modern Asian\u00a0\nand Oceanian populations to try and peel back\u00a0\u00a0 history a little bit and and understand\u00a0\nwhat was going on deep in pre-history.\u00a0\u00a0 I reached out to Joao Teixeira\u00a0\nauthor of the paper to learn more. [Joao] The paper we wrote was essentially\u00a0\nfocusing, or the idea was to focus on Island\u00a0\u00a0 Southeast Asia. When we, when we try to unpack\u00a0\nsort of the signals of Archaic introgression in\u00a0\u00a0 island southeast Asia we realized, we just have\u00a0\nto, you know, pull the movie backwards and sort\u00a0\u00a0 of like look of what what was happening before,\u00a0\nto try to fit it all together and one thing that\u00a0\u00a0 I want to make clear is that there's a myriad\u00a0\nof alternative models that could explain the\u00a0\u00a0 data and we have to sort of combine the pieces\u00a0\nthat we find with models that make sense from an\u00a0\u00a0 archaeological point of view. Because this\u00a0\nis a perspectives paper it's really taking\u00a0\u00a0 other people's work and sort of combine\u00a0\ndifferent lines of evidence to sort of make,\u00a0\u00a0 try and make a cohesive you know view. But I\u00a0\nmean it's mostly going to be wrong. Probably\u00a0\u00a0 somebody's gonna show us that they're very wrong\u00a0\nin maybe you know, one year or two years but\u00a0\u00a0 for now I would say most things that are there\u00a0\ngenetically, I think they're they're holding. [Stefan] As you can see from all of those\u00a0\ncaveats the picture is very complex,\u00a0\u00a0 but the clues that geneticists have\u00a0\nunearthed are really intriguing. [Joao] There are a couple of papers that had come\u00a0\nout just before we wrote our paper, one of them\u00a0\u00a0 by Browning et al in in cell provided evidence\u00a0\nfor two episodes of admixture with Denisovans,\u00a0\u00a0 uh and the way they saw this or the\u00a0\nway they infer these two episodes\u00a0\u00a0 is that the the admixing Denisovan\u00a0\npopulations were genetically distinct. So they found that mixture with like a\u00a0\nhigh affinity population to the altai\u00a0\u00a0 genome, right? From the fossil or from the\u00a0\npinky finger. But we yeah but they also\u00a0\u00a0 found evidence for a more distant sort of real\u00a0\ndistantly related Denisovan like group which\u00a0\u00a0 they reported in Australopapuans, so people from\u00a0\nNew Guinea and Australia, but also South Asians,\u00a0\u00a0 Gujarati you know Punjab. Okay so that's one\u00a0\npaper, and then another paper tried to model\u00a0\u00a0 Neanderthal and Denisovan admixture with modern\u00a0\nhumans using multiple demographic modelling and\u00a0\u00a0 deep learning and so they tested like different\u00a0\nplausible scenarios given what we know,\u00a0\u00a0 more or less, you know with these processes\u00a0\nor like sort of limiting to a decent amount\u00a0\u00a0 of models that would would be plausible, and they\u00a0\nthey found support for two distinct models which\u00a0\u00a0 both included admixture from a group which was\u00a0\nequidistant between neanderthals and denisovans,\u00a0\u00a0 in the ancestors of South Asians,\u00a0\nEast Asians and Australopapuans. So you can imagine as that sort of\u00a0\nradiation of modern humans went East\u00a0\u00a0 in Eurasia and before they split they sort of\u00a0\nreceived this genetic input from a population\u00a0\u00a0 that sort of, you know, was genetically\u00a0\nin between neanderthals and Denisovans. [Stefan narration] So there you have it, possible\u00a0\ngenetic signals of a denisovan-like population\u00a0\u00a0 or something in between a denisovan and a\u00a0\nneanderthal, equally related to those groups.\u00a0\u00a0 They gave this group The placeholder name extinct\u00a0\nhominin one and based on the modern populations\u00a0\u00a0 that have this admixture they propose that extinct\u00a0\nhominin one lived in the region of of South Asia,\u00a0\u00a0 everyone east of that point seems to have uh that\u00a0\ngenetic signal. So that makes a lot of sense .\u00a0\u00a0 When we consider South Asia's position\u00a0\ngeographically it does sit right in between where\u00a0\u00a0 we know neanderthals are living, where we know\u00a0\ndenisovans are living. So some population that\u00a0\u00a0 is is related to both is entirely plausible. It's\u00a0\nentirely plausible that extinct hominin one was\u00a0\u00a0 making those tools in South Asia, though obviously\u00a0\nwe do have to interpret these results cautiously. [Joao] But now people move. [Stefan] yeah [Joao] So we're most likely wrong, but what I\u00a0\nthink it's important is that yes that that is\u00a0\u00a0 possible that some of the the these mixing events\u00a0\nthat we're detecting are not necessarily like\u00a0\u00a0 from these discrete groups from which we have\u00a0\nlike sort of a couple of genomes or a handful\u00a0\u00a0 of Neanderthals, but it's there's more to it\u00a0\nthan this. It gets more reticulated than that,\u00a0\u00a0 and we need, Now is that a fossil group that's\u00a0\ngoing to correspond to that? Maybe, maybe not. What this really shows is that neanderthals\u00a0\nand denisvans are not really a separate\u00a0\u00a0 species they're like two points on a spectrum\u00a0\nand in between those two points is obviously\u00a0\u00a0 going to be a group that is related to both\u00a0\nof them and that group may well have lived in\u00a0\u00a0 South Asia, that group may well have been\u00a0\nproducing these middle Paleolithic tools. I've had to come for a walk to process all\u00a0\nmy thoughts about this issue. This has been\u00a0\u00a0 the hardest video I've ever had to make, bar none.\u00a0\nYou can see how long it's taken me by how often my\u00a0\u00a0 facial has changed, how often the background's\u00a0\nchanged. I've tried to maintain a consistent\u00a0\u00a0 facial hair for the whole time and absolutely\u00a0\nfailed. Every time I tried to create like a\u00a0\u00a0 simple but but honest narrative about\u00a0\nwhat was going on in South Asia, I failed,\u00a0\u00a0 I absolutely failed. I couldn't construct\u00a0\nall of this information into a simple tale\u00a0\u00a0 and I realized that's because what makes South\u00a0\nAsia so special is the complexity. Sometimes\u00a0\u00a0 we can get so focused on what a neanderthal is\u00a0\ndoing, what were Homo sapiens doing, what was\u00a0\u00a0 Homo erectus doing blah blah blah blah. We focus\u00a0\nin on one group doing something at one particular\u00a0\u00a0 time and it sort of creates this false impression\u00a0\nin our mind that these were truly distinct groups.\u00a0\u00a0 When we study South Asia, when we study the\u00a0\nliteral geographic bridge between all of these\u00a0\u00a0 populations we can see human evolution\u00a0\nfor the truly complex Beast that it was.\u00a0\u00a0 From the Narmada cranium which is archaic and\u00a0\nmodern and like Homo sapiens and like Homo\u00a0\u00a0 erectus, and to the tools where the transition\u00a0\nfrom Acheulean to Middle Paleolithic is so drawn\u00a0\u00a0 out over hundreds of thousands of years. DNA\u00a0\nevidence of admixture with a population that\u00a0\u00a0 isn't a neanderthal or a denisovans,\u00a0\nsomething in between these two groups,\u00a0\u00a0 you know. With South Asia there's no\u00a0\neasy answers, there's no simple models,\u00a0\u00a0 you have to confront the reality of evolution the\u00a0\ncomplexity of evolution, there's no way around\u00a0\u00a0 it. There's absolutely no line of evidence\u00a0\nwill provide you with a simple conclusion.\u00a0\u00a0 It's incredible, I love it, it's\u00a0\nfantastic. Imagine what we're\u00a0\u00a0 gonna learn in 20 years more studying this\u00a0\nregion. Mind-blowing, mind-blowing stuff.
