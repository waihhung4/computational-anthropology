"Hi everyone and welcome to Learn Chinese Now. China has a 5,000 year history, and today we are going to look at\u00a0\nChina's most important dynasties\u00a0 and\u00a0historical periods in order. Early Chinese history starts with legend. China has a story about a great flood in a\u00a0\nsimilar way that western civilization does, and after that a man named Yu was assigned\u00a0by\u00a0\nthe last of the legendary sage emperors,\u00a0\u00a0 Shun, to tame the waters. Yu dug channels to allow the\u00a0\nwater to flow out to the sea, and founded the Xia dynasty\u00a0\n(\u590f\u671d) in approximately 2070 BC. many\u00a0historians view the\u00a0\nXia as a legendary dynasty, since no archaeological sites\u00a0\nin china believed\u00a0to be Xia have\u00a0\u00a0 yielded written records to confirm\u00a0\nthat they belong to the Xia dynasty. China's next dynasty is the Shang (\u5546\u671d) The Shang are believed to have\u00a0\nruled from about 1600 to 1050\u00a0BC. A feature of the Shang is the bronze\u00a0\nartifacts that have been discovered, from cups to steamers to\u00a0cauldrons,\u00a0\u00a0 the bronzes were believed to have\u00a0\nbeen used in sacrificial rituals. These bronze artifacts\u00a0got progressively bigger\u00a0\nthroughout the dynasty as technology improved. By the end of the dynasty they were\u00a0\nmaking bronzes weighing up to 200 pounds. It is during the Shang that we see\u00a0\nthe earliest style of Chinese writing\u00a0\u00a0 the oracle bone inscriptions (\u7532\u9aa8\u6587) these are pictographs written on turtle\u00a0\nshells that Shang kings used for divination. After the Shang degenerated into what is regarded\u00a0\nas a period of decadence and low morality,\u00a0\u00a0 a frontier state called Zhou rose up and conquered\u00a0\nthe Shang, starting the Zhou dynasty (\u5468\u671d) It was during the Zhou that the idea of\u00a0\nthe Mandate of Heaven (\u5929\u547d) came into being. A king or dynasty could only rule\u00a0\nif they maintained heaven's favor, if a king acted tyrannically heaven would give\u00a0\nwarnings in the form of natural disasters, if the\u00a0king failed to heed these warnings\u00a0\nthe dynasty would descend into chaos. For the first half of the\u00a0Zhou dynasty\u00a0\nheaven seemed to be on the joking side, but the dynasty did eventually descend into chaos, beginning the Spring and Autumn and Warring States\u00a0\u00a0 periods\n(\u6625\u79cb\u6230\u570b) although it was chaotic it was during this\u00a0\nperiod that a series of philosophers emerged. the most famous of which, Confucius,\u00a0\u00a0 and his teachings of filial piety\u00a0\nand the five Confucian virtues of Ren - benevolence, Yi - justice, li -\u00a0\nrituals, Zhi - wisdom and Xin - faith would dominate the next two\u00a0\nthousand years of Chinese culture. During the\u00a0Spring and Autumn period,\u00a0\u00a0 722-481 BC, the Zhou king's power waned and few\u00a0\nlords started making and\u00a0breaking contracts, taking hostages and taking up arms. By the second half of this period, the\u00a0\nWarring\u00a0States period, 403 to 221 BC, the Zhou\u00a0\u00a0 king's power was reduced to close to zero, and\u00a0\nstates started\u00a0conquering each other one by one, until just seven states were\u00a0\nleft it was then that the\u00a0\u00a0 Qin\u00a0state in the west saw an opportunity\u00a0\nand rose up to conquer all other six, unifying china once again under\u00a0\nthe Qin dynasty 221-206 BC the rulers of the Zhou dynasty had\u00a0\nbeen called kings, (\u738b) in Chinese. but the Qin's ruler invented a new term (\u7687\u5e1d)\u00a0\u00a0 or emperor, a title which all\u00a0\nsubsequent dynastic\u00a0rulers would use. this first emperor of the Qin,\u00a0\nQinShiHuang was a brutal ruler. He solidified his unification\u00a0\nthrough a unification of culture. unifying weights and measures, written language,\u00a0\u00a0 currency, and even the width\u00a0\nof roads throughout the empire. maintaining local currency or weights\u00a0\nand measures was an act of treason. the Qin emperor is thought to have buried 460\u00a0\u00a0 scholars alive in a mass grave\u00a0\nas a warning against defiance. After the Qin emperor died, he had over\u00a0\n7000 terracotta warriors buried with him to protect him in the afterlife. This became one\u00a0\nof the most famous relics from the Qin dynasty. But the harsh reign of the Qin didn't last long. After the first emperor died in\u00a0\n210 BC, the empire\u00a0destabilized. 202 BC the Qin dynasty was defeated by\u00a0\nLiu Bang who founded the Han dynasty (\u6f22\u671d) Sometimes referred to as China's first golden\u00a0age. the Han dynasty adopted Confucianism\u00a0\nas the state philosophy, almost doubled its territory,\u00a0\u00a0 and developed trade with central Asia\u00a0\nand the Roman Empire along the silk road. It was a 400-year\u00a0period of prosperity. After the fall of the Han dynasty in 220 AD, China would remain divided for several centuries. immediately after the Han fell, China\u00a0\nentered the three kingdoms period, (\u4e09\u570b\u6642\u671f) 220 to 265 AD. This was a period of battles\u00a0\nbetween three contending powers it is the\u00a0subject of the classic Chinese\u00a0\nbook Romance of the Three Kingdoms, (\u4e09\u570b\u6f14\u7fa9) Eventually the Wei state with twice the\u00a0\npopulation of the other two prevailed,\u00a0\u00a0 and unified China starting\u00a0\nthe\u00a0short-lived Jin dynasty, However, the Jin dynasty was\u00a0\nfar from a period of stability. Palace\u00a0intrigue led to a\u00a0\ncivil war between 291 and 306. The end of the Jin dynasty's control\u00a0\nover all of\u00a0china came when XiongNu\u00a0\u00a0 tribesmen had settled in northern\u00a0\nchina and proved hard to govern. They\u00a0decided to attack the\u00a0\ncapital Luo Yang in 311 AD, and they attacked Chang An in 316 AD. For the next hundred years, north\u00a0\nChina became a battleground, and many citizens fled\u00a0southwards to Nan Jing\u00a0\nwhere the Jin had set up a government in exile. 420 to 589 AD is known\u00a0as the Northern\u00a0\nand Southern dynasties period, (\u5357\u5317\u671d) China was divided between north and south. Throughout this whole period\u00a0\nof division Buddhism which had\u00a0\u00a0 originally been introduced\u00a0to China during\u00a0\nthe Han dynasty increased in popularity. By the year 477 North China had over 6000 Buddhist\u00a0\ntemples and South China had close to 3000. Some Confucianists criticized Buddhist monks\u00a0\nfor not providing heirs to their family, however, Buddhists argued that having a member\u00a0\nof the family walk the path to enlightenment\u00a0\u00a0 brought blessings to all their relatives. Many\u00a0rulers during this time\u00a0\u00a0 actively supported and raised money\u00a0\nfor the building of Buddhist temples, such as WuDi of Liang, who once had\u00a0\nhimself held hostage until his court\u00a0\u00a0 raised a huge sum of\u00a0money to have him released. this money was then used to\u00a0\nsupport Buddhist establishments. Finally in\u00a0581 AD, china was again\u00a0\nunified by the Sui dynasty, (\u968b\u671d) The Sui emperor WenDi viewed\u00a0\nhimself as a Buddhist ruler, and used military force to\u00a0\ndefend the Buddhist faith. Him and his\u00a0successor had\u00a0\nambitious plans to rebuild China, but this took its toll on the populace. Over one\u00a0million men were called up for military\u00a0\nservice in a campaign against Korea for example. it was only\u00a0four decades until\u00a0\nthe Sui dynasty was overthrown. The victor of this rebellion was a man named\u00a0Li\u00a0\nYuan, a cousin of the second Sui emperor, who founded the Tang dynasty (\u5510\u671d) in 618 AD and\u00a0would rule as emperor Gao Zu before abdicating\u00a0\nto his son who ruled as emperor Tang Tai Zong. and\u00a0so started China's golden age the Sui dynasty had started the\u00a0\ncivil service examination system,\u00a0\u00a0 based on the Confucian classics. The Tang expanded on this, setting up schools,\u00a0\u00a0 issuing state versions of\u00a0the Confucian\u00a0\nclassics, complete with commentaries China now had a political system based more\u00a0on\u00a0\nmerit rather than hereditary privilege, apart from the position of emperor, The Tang capital at Chang\u00a0\nAn was very cosmopolitan. The city and its suburbs had\u00a0\naround 2 million\u00a0inhabitants, the biggest city in the world at the time. China's three religions: Buddhism, Taoism,\u00a0\nand Confucianism thrived in Tang times. Chang An had hundreds of monasteries,\u00a0\ntemples, and\u00a0some foreign churches. One of the most famous art forms to\u00a0\ncome out of Tang times was poetry. Two\u00a0of the most famous Chinese poets Li\u00a0\nBai and Du Fu live during Tang times. Li Bai is known for his romanticism\u00a0\nand drunken descriptions of the moon, while Du Fu was a realist poet who\u00a0\ndescribed the\u00a0realities of the time. During Tang times, tea also went\u00a0\nfrom being a medicinal tonic\u00a0\u00a0 to the single\u00a0most popular drink in China. this popularization was facilitated by Lu Yu\u00a0\nwho wrote the Cha Jing, or classic of tea. He would later be known as (\u8336\u8056) the sage of tea But nothing lasts forever. Eventually the Tang\u00a0\u00a0 dynasty degenerated into local\u00a0\nwarlords battling for power. and in 960 AD, was replaced\u00a0\nby the Song dynasty (\u5b8b\u671d) Although the Song dynasty started off\u00a0\nstrong with\u00a0rapid economic development,\u00a0\u00a0 it was militarily weak, and could not exert the same dominance in\u00a0\nAsia as\u00a0the Han and Tang dynasties did. In the year 1126, the Song capital Kaifung\u00a0\nwas attacked by\u00a0Jurchens from the north. the emperor and 3000 members of the imperial\u00a0\nfamily were captured and\u00a0taken north. After Chinese forces regrouped further south,\u00a0\u00a0 the emperor's youngest son was\u00a0\nproclaimed the new emperor in Hang Zhou. After losing the north, the dynasty\u00a0\nlasted a further century and\u00a0a half. Yet on a cultural level the\u00a0\nSong dynasty still flourished. Policies were less restrictive, markets in\u00a0\ncities could open at night, tea houses sprung up, and there were storytellers, puppet shows, and\u00a0\npoets writing in the new Song dynasty style (\u5b8b\u8a5e) The Song dynasty is known for its\u00a0\nlandscape\u00a0paintings or Shan Shui Hua. Northern Song works often were huge grand scenes. After the loss of the north paintings were\u00a0\nsmaller leaving large expanses of canvas empty, which scholars\u00a0generally believe to\u00a0\nrepresent the loss of the Chinese heartland, and the feeling of emptiness that\u00a0\nabounded after the Northern Song\"s defeat. The Southern Song scholars viewed\u00a0\nprotecting\u00a0Confucian values\u00a0\u00a0 as protecting the essence\u00a0of Chinese culture. In Song times, one of the\u00a0most important\u00a0\u00a0 commentaries on the confusion classics\u00a0\nwas published by the scholar Zhu Xi, this\u00a0would later become the commentary on which\u00a0\u00a0 all subsequent civil service\u00a0\nexaminations were based, up until the end of the civil\u00a0\nservice examination system in 1905. Even at the beginning of the\u00a0song dynasty\u00a0\nthere was already a foreign state existing\u00a0\u00a0 on territory to the north which\u00a0\nhad once been part of China. This was the Liao dynasty (\u907c\u671d) Formed by the Khitan people around\u00a0\nthe fall of\u00a0the Tang dynasty, it lasted from 907 to 1125 AD. Not only did the Liao dynasty have a Chinese name, but also took on the Chinese\u00a0\nimperial hereditary system, in contrast to the Khitan way of\u00a0\nelecting the chief of the clan. This dynasty started a trend of\u00a0\nforeign rule that would eventually\u00a0\u00a0 unite the\u00a0whole of China under the Mongols. After the Liao was the Jin dynasty\u00a0\n(\u91d1\u671d) also called (\u5927\u91d1) or great Jin. This was the dynasty which defeated the Northern\u00a0\nSong and pushed the Song imperial\u00a0court south. It was founded by the Jurchen\u00a0\npeople whose descendants were\u00a0\u00a0 the Manchus that later\u00a0founded the Qing dynasty. the Jurchens first defeated the\u00a0\nLiao and then turned on the Song. Having incorporated Chinese military experts\u00a0\ninto their army from defeated Chinese cities, they laid siege to Kaifeng the Song capital. The city was defended by 48,000 troops\u00a0\nwith\u00a0crossbows and flamethrowers. Yes, the Chinese had figured\u00a0\nout gunpowder by this time. Although\u00a0they didn't use it\u00a0\nto make guns like in the west, there were a wide variety of\u00a0\nChinese weapons that\u00a0used fire. the Jurchens brought 30 catapults to\u00a0\nlaunch huge stones towards the city, iron sheeting\u00a0to bridge the moat, and siege towers higher than the city walls, from which they threw bombs down into the city. and so the Song capital fell. The Jin dynasty ruled over around\u00a0\n40 million people in\u00a0north China and adopted many of the\u00a0\ninstitutions of Chinese government. As the dynasty went on, the Jurchens started\u00a0\nadopting more and more Chinese customs, such as language, dress, and rituals. Although this was disrupted after\u00a0\nan assassination of the emperor by\u00a0\u00a0 Jurchen officials protesting\u00a0the\u00a0\nassimilation to Chinese culture, by the end of the dynasty most\u00a0\nJurchens did indeed speak Chinese,\u00a0\u00a0 wear Chinese clothes, adopt Chinese names, and\u00a0\nmany even married with the local population. In the late 12th century, there arose\u00a0\nanother contender for the rule of all china, the Mongolian ruler Genghis Khan. Although the Mongol conquest of the\u00a0\nSong started after Genghis Khan's death, Genghis khan started what would become the\u00a0\nlargest contiguous land empire in history, stretching all the way from\u00a0\nKorea to eastern Europe. It was Genghis's grandson Kublai\u00a0\nwho led the conquest of the song. The Jin dynasty had already been\u00a0\ndefeated, and in the year 1271, Kublai moved his capital from Mongolia\u00a0\nto Beijing which at that time was called This year marks the start of the Yuan dynasty, Like the Liao and the Jin, the foreign invaders\u00a0\nadopted a Chinese name for their empire. The conquest of the south took some time however, the Mongols had to build a fleet of boats,\u00a0\u00a0 engaged in a five-year siege of the city\u00a0\nof Xiang Yang in the Yangtze valley. And after crossing the\u00a0Yangtze in 1275, the Song Empress Dowager managed to summon\u00a0\na force of 200,000 to fight\u00a0the Mongols. But the Mongols were a fearsome enemy, and after slaughtering the entire\u00a0\npopulation of the city of Chang Zhou, the Song Empress surrendered. The Mongols finally defeated the last Song\u00a0\nloyalists in a naval battle in the year 1279. Under Yuan rule, Chinese were allowed to maintain\u00a0\nmost of their customs and religious practices. Although the Italian explorer Marco Polo noted\u00a0\u00a0 that there was a lot of ethnic\u00a0\ntension in China at the time, different races were subject to different\u00a0\ntaxation laws and were placed in a hierarchy. For example, a Chinese would be subject to\u00a0\nsevere penalties for fighting against Mongols, but a Mongol could get off with a\u00a0\nmere fine if he killed the Chinese. Chinese were also forbidden from owning weapons. But at this time, China was\u00a0\nconsidered the center\u00a0of the world, Chinese culture was superior and\u00a0\nthe Emperor, the Son of Heaven. The Yuan emperors\u00a0kept Chinese advisers\u00a0\u00a0 and reinstated the imperial\u00a0\nexamination system in 1315. Although they did have\u00a0quotas to make sure ethnic\u00a0\nChinese especially citizens of the former Song were outnumbered by Mongols and\u00a0\nother races in the government. Since China was now tied to a Eurasian empire,\u00a0\nmore Europeans than ever before visited China, and Chinese culture and inventions such\u00a0\nas printing and gunpowder spread west. Before long, Europeans with some knowledge\u00a0\nof the exotic lands and\u00a0cultures of the east, would start their own age of exploration, something which ethnic Chinese at the time, and in\u00a0\nthe centuries to come, were not too pleased about. In 1368, China was finally under the\u00a0\nrule of an ethnic Chinese ruler again. and the Ming dynasty or (\u660e\u671d) was founded. Emperor\u00a0Taizu had started off as a commoner, living in poverty as a youth. His parents had died when he\u00a0was 16. He spent time in a Buddhist temple before joining\u00a0\na rebel group he would later come to lead. He first took Nanjing and then took his\u00a0\narmy right to the Mongol capital at Beijing the Mongol\u00a0ruler fled and\u00a0\nTaizu established his dynasty. Taizu proved to be a very harsh ruler, conducting\u00a0\nseveral purges of the elite and literati. However, the imperial examination system continued\u00a0\ntesting students knowledge of the four books, Confucius analects, Mencius, the Doctrine\u00a0\nof the Mean, and the Great Learning, as interpreted in the commentary\u00a0\nof the scholar Zhu Xi. The\u00a0Ming dynasty saw an explosion in\u00a0\npublishing and vernacular literature, blue and white Ming porcelain\u00a0\nbecame a hot commodity in Europe. In the religious sphere, out of China's three\u00a0\nreligions, early Ming emperors favored Taoism, and Taizu to outlaw Christianity. However later on,\u00a0a wave of Jesuit\u00a0\nmissionaries brought knowledge of astronomy,\u00a0\u00a0 mathematics, and geography to China. the\u00a0most famous of which was Mateo Richie, who lived in Beijing from 1601 to 1610. Control of China's\u00a0borders proved\u00a0\ntroublesome for the Ming emperors. the Great Wall you see today was built\u00a0\nin Ming times to keep the Mongols out. China's coasts faced threats\u00a0\nfrom smugglers and pirates, China's naval power increased\u00a0\nsubstantially during the Ming. The explorer Zhenghe was\u00a0\ndispatched by the emperor, to go on several voyages looking for\u00a0\ntribute states for the Ming empire. Zhenghe got as far as the\u00a0coast of east Africa. Despite the Chinese distrust of\u00a0\nforeigners, many western powers had become major\u00a0maritime forces in Asia, and international trade with\u00a0\nthese foreign powers flourished. Although\u00a0the Ming always regarded the\u00a0\nforeign powers as mere tribute states, and limited them to trading posts\u00a0\nwithout access to the Chinese interior. But, by the 1600s, despite\u00a0\npositive economic growth, the Ming government had grown\u00a0\ntoo large and expensive. A drop in temperatures during this\u00a0\ntime led to a shorter growing season and a famine between the years of 1627 and 28. Gangs started\u00a0ravaging the countryside, and the state didn't have the\u00a0\nfinancial resources to react. The Ming started having trade problems\u00a0\nwith the Japanese and the Spanish which shut down major flows of silver into\u00a0\nChina, leading to further fiscal problems. As Ming society started to break down,\u00a0\ndifferent factions fought for power, the Ming's Mandate of Heaven had expired. In 1644 the warlord Li Zicheng marched on Beijing, and the Ming emperor committed suicide. But Li's rule of China\u00a0hardly lasted. The Manchus, who had been building up their\u00a0\nstate and armies outside the great wall, marched on China. A Ming general named Wu Sangui who is\u00a0\ntasked with guarding a great wall outpost, sided with the Manchus against Li and his rebels. So started the Qing dynasty, also\u00a0called another period of alien rule for China. but a period that brought wealth,\u00a0\nstability, and territorial expansion. At least until China was weakened\u00a0\nby foreign powers in the 1800s. In 1645, the Qing rulers ordered all men in\u00a0\nthe empire to adopt the Manchu hairstyle. they had to get a\u00a0haircut and start\u00a0\ngrowing what was called a queue, within 10 days or faced death. This was to show\u00a0their loyalty to the new dynasty. Most Chinese saw no option but to obey. It took several decades for the Qing to\u00a0\ntrack down and crush the last Ming loyalists. Once emperor Kang Xi took power in 1669, China entered a period of stability that lasted 130 years, and saw\u00a0\nonly three emperors on the\u00a0throne. Kang Xi and his grandson Qian\u00a0\nLong each ruled for over 60 years. Kang Xi embraced Chinese culture,\u00a0\ncontinuing the imperial examination system, allowing ethnic Chinese to\u00a0\nhave a place in the\u00a0government, and ordering the completion of the Kang\u00a0\nXi dictionary of Chinese characters. Kang Xi\u00a0also welcomed Jesuit missionaries to the\u00a0\u00a0 court appointing them to the\u00a0\nimperial board of astronomy. After the short reign of Kang Xi's\u00a0\nson Yong Zheng, the emperor Qian\u00a0\u00a0 Long took over starting another\u00a060-year reign. Qian Long was a patron of the arts. In addition to studying and painting himself, he\u00a0also amassed a huge collection\u00a0\nof Chinese artwork at the palace he added his own poems and\u00a0\ncalligraphy to many paintings during this time china's territory\u00a0\nexpanded to include the whole of\u00a0Tibet Xinjiang in the west, Mongolia, and the island\u00a0\nof Taiwan, previously a Dutch colonial outpost. In\u00a0the Qing period,\u00a0\nConfucianism became more strict, scholar officials feared a similar unravelling\u00a0\nof society that happened in the late Ming. But threats to Chinese society came\u00a0\nfrom the outside as well\u00a0as from within. The Chinese had previously limited\u00a0\nwestern trade only to certain ports and limited\u00a0westerners access\u00a0\nto the interior of the country, regarding the western powers\u00a0\nas mere tribute\u00a0states. In 1793, the British sent lord McCartney\u00a0\nto meet with the emperor Qian Long. McCartney came with gifts\u00a0\nof scientific instruments, carpets, knives, glass objects, all\u00a0\nmeant to arouse\u00a0Chinese interest\u00a0\u00a0 in British manufactured goods. But Qian Long showed no interest, proclaiming\u00a0in a letter to the king\u00a0\nof England: we possess all things I have no use for your country's manufactures. By the year 1800, the British were purchasing\u00a0\nabout one-seventh of the tea produced\u00a0in China, and paying for their tea using silver. This contributed about one-tenth of state\u00a0\nrevenue through the tax they paid on tea. However, since China refused to buy British\u00a0\ngoods, this led to a massive trade imbalance. British silver flowed into\u00a0\nChina and never came back. The British needed a product to\u00a0\nbalance out the relationship. This product came in the form of opium. The British East India Company\u00a0\ntransported opium from India to China, then brought tea from China back to Britain. The Qing court understood the perils of opium\u00a0\naddiction and sought to outlaw the substance, but\u00a0this led to further\u00a0\nconfrontation with the British, who possessed superior naval forces. And thus, the so-called Opium Wars led to several unfair treaties between\u00a0\nthe Qing dynasty and the British. The Qing were forced to open\u00a0\nup more ports to British trade, they ceded the island of Hong Kong\u00a0\nfor the British to use as a colony, and the opium trade went on unaffected. Other European powers such as\u00a0\nthe French and the Germans, as well as the Russians and Japanese, all\u00a0\nsucceeded in occupying parts of Chinese territory, and forcing the Chinese to\u00a0\nopen up more ports for trade. The 1800s also\u00a0sought several\u00a0\nrebellions internally, the largest of which was the Taiping Rebellion. Faced with\u00a0intrusion by western\u00a0\npowers and rebellions from within, the Qing decided to try to use some aspects\u00a0of\u00a0\nwestern learning to strengthen the dynasty. The Self-strengthening Movement, was started. China started to industrialize\u00a0\nbuild western weapons and warships, railroads factories, and promotes study\u00a0\nof western science and mathematics. Yet this movement was ultimately unsuccessful. During a battle with the\u00a0\nFrench in Vietnam in\u00a0the 1880s. It took the French only an hour to destroy\u00a0\nan entire fleet of new Chinese ships. By the end of the 1800s, Qing\u00a0\nchina had been utterly humiliated. Losing a war with Japan over Korea, they were forced to hand over\u00a0\nTaiwan and Liaodong to the Japanese. This started a frenzy of other countries\u00a0\nseizing territory for themselves in\u00a0China. It was almost looking like China was\u00a0\ngoing to be carved up by western powers\u00a0\u00a0 the same way\u00a0Africa was. In 1900, the Boxer Rebellion prompted a force of\u00a0\n20,000 allied soldiers from the western\u00a0powers to march from Tianjin to Beijing and put\u00a0\ndown the rebellion and then loot the city. The Qing\u00a0were ordered to pay twice\u00a0\nthe government's annual revenue\u00a0\u00a0 as repatriation to the western powers. Amazingly the Qing managed to hold on to\u00a0\npower into the beginning of the 20th century. But change\u00a0was inevitable. In 1905, the centuries-old system of\u00a0\nimperial service examinations was abolished, and\u00a0the modern western style\u00a0\nschool system was set up. In 1912, the last Qing emperor abdicated, and China\u00a0entered the modern era. An era that despite hopeful start,\u00a0\u00a0 would lead to the worst destruction\u00a0\nof traditional Chinese culture, and the largest loss of Chinese life in history. Scholars today\u00a0look back on the imperial\u00a0\nexamination system based on Confucian values as one of the\u00a0most advanced\u00a0\npolitical systems in history. Some even feel bringing back\u00a0\naspects of Confucian learning would be essential to\u00a0\nreinvigorating Chinese culture and reversing\u00a0negative trends\u00a0\nin modern Chinese society. If you stuck with this video\u00a0\nall the way to the\u00a0end,\u00a0\u00a0 you must be a true scholar of Chinese history. A lot can be learned from China's\u00a0\n5,000 years\u00a0of traditional culture. Many of the profound principles of Chinese\u00a0\nphilosophy could make our\u00a0societies better today, and the written records are just sitting there, waiting to be discovered.
