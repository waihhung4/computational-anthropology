"audio jungle [Music] audio jungle now we are seeing is air leak toll culture in yenshur henan it has long been considered by most as the capital of the sia dynasty but it is controversial in fact about sia dynasty all information we know comes from records of the historical records by c machine historian who lived in the 2bc and he recorded historical stories from ancient times to his own times in his books in the 1920s and 1930s some historians questioned the existence of the sea dynasty according to current archaeological results there was indeed a developed civilization in china more than two thousand years ago but due to the lack of written records it is still impossible to determine whether this is the so-called sea dynasty so what we are going to talk about today is based on historical records as we said earlier you took control of the flood so shun gave the throne to you and you son chi succeeded his father and founded the dynasty chi became monarch he sent troops to attack the tribes that did not obey him and conquered all the tribes with his powerful army in his later years she was very stupid indulging in pleasure and not dealing with affairs seriously his son taikong was even more stupid than his father and he became monarch that's the downside of family rule the lack of competitors means that successors smart or not eventually become leaders and they don't have to responsibly to the people only to their families so that they can continue to rule the country taikong's rule caused so much dissatisfaction that a tribal chief in the north named he killed taikan while he was out hunting and became king himself from the moment that the shia dynasty fell into chaos for 40 years later taikong's great-grandson xiao kang regained power and was determined to govern the country well for the next 300 years the sia dynasty never fell into large chaos again at the end of the sia dynasty people's beliefs gradually changed people gradually changed from the worship of ancestors and ancient totem to the specific gods at that time people regarded the unexplainable things in nature as gods mountain have mountain gods and water have water gods and people sacrifice to the mountain gods for a good harvest and worship the gods of water for adequate rain at this time people's belief was based on nature but in the next dynasty shang dynasty was institutionalized the ritual and became an important part of the nation jia the last king of the sya dynasty was a very stupid king he did not care about politics and played all day it is said that he liked a beauty named moshi who had a special hobby of listening to the sound of silk tearing so jia found a lot of silk and tore them up to make moshi happy gia also built a pond in the palace and filled it with liquor he often sat beside the pond to play with moshi the pond was so deep that someone fell in and drowned the officials asked jia to care about the people but jia said what do i have to do with the people we are like the sun and the moon the moon did not destroy how can the sun destroy the people were very angry when they heard this and pointed to sun and said if the sun were destroyed the moon would be willing to die with you there was a powerful tribal chief named tang who was very dissatisfied with jia's behavior so he decided to overthrow the syad dynasty and a man named een helped him the story of e in is very legendary it is said that his mother was picking mulberry in each one one day she dreamed that the god told her to run east if water burst into basin tomorrow the next day there was water in the basin so she called on the villagers to run east together on her way to escape she looked back at the village and saw that it had been flooded because of was not listened to the god she was became a hollow mulberry tree later when someone passed by he found a baby in the tree the man rescued the baby and gave it to the cook to raise at first e in was a slave who cooked for tang iain was not willingly as a slave so he tried to show himself to tang sometimes he cooks food very salty sometimes very light tang was very angry and called eating over for questioning iain said i certainly know that food should not be too salty or too light this is the same with governing the country it should neither rush nor slow tang was very surprised and thought iain was capable so he appointed een as the prime minister to help him tang followed yin's advice and did not choose to attack sia immediately as others attacked the sia dynasty it became weaker and weaker tang finally attacked the sya dynasty and wiped it out at one stroke jia the ruler of the state was exiled and four hundred years of rule ended and a new dynasty the shang was established [Music] the sia dynasty was the first dynasty in chinese history in fact it was more like a huge tribal alliance than a dynasty because it had a loose ruling structure and many institutions were not established as the successor to the syah the shang dynasty decided to consolidate its rule in a special way [Music] thanks for watching and if you like be sure to like it and subscribe to bamboo
