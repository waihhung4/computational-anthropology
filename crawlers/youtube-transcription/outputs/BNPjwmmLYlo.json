"good morning good afternoon good evening to all of you around this world of ours and today we are at long last returning to the lands of ancient china where we uncover the second of china's ancient dynasties the shun the successor state to the supposedly mythical shah dynasty of ancient china before approaching the point where the shang overtakes the shah we must first delve a little into mythology to see perhaps where the shung came from before we go into even that however i must give a heads up i am a native english speaker so i'm going to try and pronounce everything from here on out as best i can however it's inevitable i am probably going to butcher some of the pronunciations and for that i apologize in advance and with that out of the way we turn to the story of a woman known as gian d who according to this piece of mythology was the wife of an emperor or leader known as khu one day gian d swallowed an egg said to have been dropped by a black bird and later on in time gave birth to someone known as shier and shie later on in his life assisted someone known as you who happened to be the man who would one day become you the great the emperor of the shah dynasty who was said to have tamed the flooding of the violent yellow river and for his assistance you the great granted shield the lands known as the shun to rule as a thief of the shah that was quite the collection of names there but that comprises an oversimplified version of the founding myth of the shang dynasty the dynasty that would one day overpower china's supposed first dynasty the shah with that we come to circa 1600 bce one of several dates put forward as the official beginning of the shang dynasty but for simplicity's sake let's go with 1600 bce for reference at around this time the hiksos peoples were a hundred years away from being ousted from egypt by pharaoh almost a the first back in china however this was said to have been the time when the shang dynasty finally overthrew the shah jie the last emperor of the shah dynasty was said to have been a cruel tyrant however the ruler of shang at this time the descendant of xie by the name of tongue rose up and after the battle of ming tiau overthrew jie as ruler officially establishing the shang dynasty at this point before we go any further it's important to mention that these two political entities shah and shang did not rule over the entirety of china as we know it today instead the power of the shah and the shang worked a little like this say for instance one of the two the shah or the shang was the dominant power in the region at one point in time instead of ruling directly over a vast expanse of territory they would instead hold vassalage over nearby kingdoms and tribes the shah for example were said to have held vassalage under the reign of ga over as many as 40 smaller kingdoms all of which were said to have given their support to tongue in his rebellion against the cruel ga as for the last emperor of the shah he was said to have been exiled where later he would die of an unknown illness as this was happening however the shang dynasty began with the reign of its first ruler tang that very same man descended from shii who had rebelled against the shah and his rule was said to have been a good one he began by lowering taxes and also reducing the conscription rate of soldiers to the army of the shang because after all who doesn't love an extra bit of cash in their pocket and you never know when said cash might come in handy for building a brand new palace which is exactly what tongue did this palace however you could argue functioned more like a museum or a memorial for this palace was called char shay and tongue built this palace to memorialize the shah dynasty preserving its memory for generations to come and for that i agree tang was a very good ruler can't go wrong with a museum in my opinion the next shang ruler of note is known by the name of tai jia this ruler however is contrasted to tongue as he was said to have been a bad ruler and according to the records of the grand historian was said to have broken his own laws in response to this one of his governors yi yin exiled taijia to perhaps what is now known as henan province where the tomb of the first shang ruler tang was said to have been located in order to repent for his breaking of the laws after feeling satisfied that tai cha had repented yi yin invited taija back to rule as shun ruler although another source for this the bamboo annals claims that yi yin seized the throne and was later killed by tai jia for attempting a coup against him archaeological evidence found however suggests that yi yin was still honored after his death meaning that it's possible that the account given by the bamboo annals in this instance may have been false however the sources appear to be slightly conflicted on this matter the next shun king we shall address however goes by the name of taiwu and his ability to rule may have been a little more mixed than his predecessors tongue and tai jar for you see according to the records we have in the seventh year of his reign a mulberry tree and millet were found to be growing within the palace of taiwu within only seven days these two plants grew to very tall trees within the palace and this worried taiwu greatly taiwu therefore turned to one of his advisors yishei for an explanation on this occurrence yisher determined that these plants were growing as they were as a result of taiwu's incapabilities in governance up until that point heeding this warning taiwa was said to have worked diligently with his ministers and advisers in order to improve his governance as a result of this these two massive trees withered and it was said that thereafter taiwu was seen as a good ruler a point of note alongside this story is that taiwu was said to have reigned for 75 years in total and those 75 years it seems were rather bountiful it said that in the 46th year of his reign there was a great harvest of crops with plentiful food following this in the 58th year of his reign taiwu built the city of pugu so if you ask me on the whole taiwu did not have that bad of a rain maybe it got off to a rocky start with the story about the mulberry and militaries growing in in his palace but this may be a metaphor for perhaps how bad he was governing when he first came to the throne but of course in this we can't be certain the next shong ruler of note wu ding comes to us in the year circa 1250 bce that's right we have a date for this one and this ruler wu ding appears to have accomplished a lot during his reign in order to strengthen shang's vassalage over nearby neighbouring tribes wu ding married one woman from each of these neighboring tribes and according to what we know wu ding ended up having 64 wives during the course of his reign certainly puts king henry viii of england to shame i can tell you that much but out of these 64 wives only three of them became queens of the shang dynasty these three queens were known as [Music] and it's fou how that we are going to take particular focus on for the next little bit foo how was one of the women woo ding married in order to strengthen the vassalage of the shang over some of their neighbouring tribes and foohal was strategically minded she used the semi-matriarchal society within the royal household to her advantage eventually working her way up to become one of the king's favorite consorts this next bit is where it gets really interesting however fulfou hall was later made a general in the army of the shang and at this she was said to be incredibly effective for up until this point a neighbouring power known as the two fung had long been a thorn in the shang's side leading chiang's armies however fuja was able to utterly crush the two fung which led to their conquest by the shang not stopping here however neighbouring powers such as the yi yang and bar were swiftly conquered by fu hal adding even more territory to the now expanding shang dynasty however it has been said that this formidable general died long before wu ding and her great accomplishments led to her being buried in a lavish tomb for the time right in the capital of the shang dynasty and interestingly later on when a neighbouring power known as the gong threatened to wipe the shang dynasty off the map entirely wu ding made sacrifices at the tomb of fu hao in hopes of receiving her assistance from beyond the grave and although there are no specifics about the gong other than this we can safely assume that this sacrifice to foohar paid off for we've still got one to two centuries of shang history to cover yet so here wu ding may have made the right call in offering sacrifices to foo hull to gain her assistance in defeating the gong and as a result we can safely assume that the reign of wooding over the shang dynasty was rather successful seeing a great amount of expansion which as we shall see as we move on to the next notable shang ruler precipitated in the shang dynasty's golden age zuja our next shang ruler of note works to expand the shang vassalage even further by battling the wrong people to the west of shang's borders unfortunately however after the death of zuja is when the shang's luck and prestige begins to run out for after the death of zucha began arguably perhaps the decline of the shang dynasty's prowess in the region with a neighboring power known as the zhou who were at this time gradually starting to gain power and influence in the shang's neighborhood and the decline of the shang perhaps begins with the ruler woo ye for a vassal state of the shang the yuchi roughly 30 years into the reign of woo ye according to the bamboo annals fell into civil war and the jar taking advantage of this opportunity entered this civil war and defeated both of the contenders for the throne of yuchi resulting in its annexation by the zhou whose power would only continue to increase over the next century as the shang declined further furthermore wu yi was said to have been a rather blasphemous ruler for at least several times he was said to have insulted the gods in heaven destroying an idol of the god of heaven and then later saying that the god of thunder and lightning was simply nothing and the god of thunder and lightning it appears enjoyed a bit of irony for it was said that in 1112 bce woo ye was killed when he was struck by lightning near the yellow river and throughout the next 20 to 30 years the zhou would become bolder and bolder until finally under the reign of d shin the zhou would attack the shang and finally overpower them but before the fall we must discuss the last ruler of the shang dynasty di shin for it seems a lot of the information about him in succeeding dynasties of china would come to greatly exaggerate and even falsify some of the details regarding de shin's reign painting him as a corrupt and immoral leader one account claims that in palace grounds the shin would have a pool carved out of the ground and have it filled with wine this pool would then have an island constructed in the centre of it and this island was said to have trees in air quotes with its branches built using wait for this meat skewers and these skewers were filled with boundless quantities of meat and this pool it was said was big enough for several canoes to drift about the place meaning that if di shin and his guests were thirsty all they had to do was simply reach down and sip some of the wine if they were hungry all they needed to do was row out to the island and eat meat off of the branches of these trees furthermore the shin was also said to have massive parties involving uh oh um let's just say some mature things but of course as i said these accounts may of course be false for this is actually a common theme in world history for one dynasty or empire or kingdom or ruler to justify their conquest by demonizing what came before and here it seems the fate of the shang dynasty and its last ruler di shin is no exception for in the year circa 1046 bce the xiang army was decisively defeated by the jar at the battle of mooye after this defeat di shin was said to have taken his own life ending the shang dynasty supremacy in china once and for all so there you have it the history of the shang dynasty of china china's second ancient dynasty following the supposedly mythical shah but we're not done with the shang dynasty just yet so join us next time as we uncover what the archaeological record has to say about the shang dynasty and also as we look into several sources that are often cited when talking about the shang and the shah several of which you may have heard me mention in this video already so if you enjoyed this video perhaps consider leaving a like and maybe subscribe so that you don't miss out on any more updates on releases from the grand portfolio concerning the history of
