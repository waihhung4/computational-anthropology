"[Music] it is the dawn of the 9th millennium bc the last ice age is now a distant memory over the preceding millennia we have seen permanent settlements appear throughout the near east at these sites which would have housed populations in the low hundreds we see people closing the final chapter on their hunter-gatherer past in its place we will soon see the emergence of domesticated crops and animals the adoption of which would fuel population boom throughout the fertile crescent the next two thousand years would see the slow growth of settlement throughout the levant syria and in the mountainous regions of anatolia by the beginning of the 7th millennium bc we see the development of what some archaeologists have termed mega sites unprecedented in both their scale and density here thousands of people would have lived and died with their remains often being buried beneath the floors of buildings in which their relatives continued to reside alongside this we see a great flowering of neolithic artwork with ritual depictions of wild bulls vultures and statues of gods and goddesses in human form finally we see the development of an international cult which revolved around the ritual extraction and decoration of human skulls and yet only a few hundred years later it would all come crashing to an end over the course of our previous episode we examined the first sedentary communities to appear in the near east at the site of a hallow 2 we saw the earliest known evidence of crop cultivation which may have taken place as far back as the height of the last ice age over 20 000 years ago at the end of this period the average global temperature began to increase we saw the appearance of semi-permanent settlements throughout the near east in the event we saw the increasingly complex exploitation of wild grasses by the natufian peoples from around 14900 bc including the earliest known evidence for the making of foodstuffs such as bread and beer then the climate deteriorated once more around 10 800 bc glacial conditions returned across northern europe and america and in the near east many areas would have suddenly become cooler and drier than before the wild grasses of the region became less abundant and natuvian settlements were slowly abandoned in favor of more mobile lifestyles this state of affairs persisted for nearly a millennium before finally warmer conditions began to return throughout this period known as the earlier pre-pottery neolithic permanent settlements began to reappear throughout the levant and northern syria along with new communities throughout southeastern turkey it is in these settlements that we see the first evidence of monumental building activity along with what may be early examples of ritual structures and to the north we see the construction of a site of unprecedented complexity marked by colossal t-shaped pillars which were in turn covered in ritual carvings and animal symbology gobekli tepe the world's earliest known temple so by the later pre-pottery neolithic a period that began around 8800 bc it's clear that humanity has come a long way from the mobile hunter-gatherer lifestyle that has characterized much of its history even so we are still a distance away from the developed civilizations that would emerge in parts of the near east from the 4th millennium bc onwards to demonstrate this let's quickly remind ourselves of the criteria we laid out for civilization during our last episode first off we expect civilizations to be characterized by dense urban environments not dissimilar to those of modern towns and cities these urban environments rely on agricultural support from the surrounding area without which their existence would be impossible in addition to this these centres are also marked by monumental building practices a complex social hierarchy and are administered for a developed system of writing and literacy in our last episode we saw plentiful evidence of monumental building in the form of the colossal wall and tower constructed at jericho or the vast ritual enclosures of gobekwipe when it comes to the rest of our criteria however the evidence is lacking indeed many of the early settlements we see at the beginning of the later pre-pottery neolithic retain much in common their hunter-gatherer predecessors most of these communities still relied on hunting as their principal supply of meat a practice they supplemented with simple crop cultivation and perhaps even simple forms of animal domestication but in this episode all of that is about to change over the next two and a half millennia we will see the emergence of the world's first urbanized societies that depended on the farming of domesticated crops and animals to survive let us begin then by examining the settlements that appeared throughout the near east during the later pre-pottery neolithic unlike the natufian period which ended with a return to more mobile forms of living the transition between the earlier and later pre-pottery neolithic is not marked by any great disruption in settlement pattern instead we see the steady expansion of existing communities over the next two millennia such as jericho and the levant and murray bet in northern syria in the southern levant we also see a number of long-lived settlements founded east of the jordan valley with the most important of these sites being established italian ghazal alongside the banks of the zagwa river in syria the natophane era site of abu huraira was reoccupied whilst a new settlement was established at tawaswad near modern damascus further north we see a dramatic increase in site number throughout southeastern turkey in addition to a vast expansion in the size of an earlier pre-pottery neolithic settlement at chayunu we also see the establishment of a new center at navale chori as well as at the site of a sikle huyak further to the west and alongside this increase in settlement number also came an increase in size whereas a large settlement in the earlier pre-pottery neolithic may have held a population in the low hundreds by the end of the later pottery neolithic we will see the emergence of sites where thousands of people would have lived and died at any one time these increasingly large settlements were facilitated by a number of innovations the first of these was a major change in the way that these settlements would have been structured in the earlier pre-pottery neolithic many sites are characterized by wide open spaces between buildings which in turn would have largely consisted of circular dwellings in the later pre-pottery neolithic however we increasingly see settlements constructed with less and less space between buildings around the same time rectangular houses began to emerge as the most common form of dwelling throughout the near east compared to circular dwellings these rectangular buildings could have been more tightly packed together even sharing walls where necessary in the levant many of these houses were constructed from mud brick with a small pier like antechamber which in turn would have led to a single room interior at settlements in southeastern anatolia however a very different approach was taken here houses were constructed on a narrow rock and mud mortar substructure the remains of which can still be seen today at chayunu in the valley chori this substructure which was probably used for storage would have supported a raised floor on top of which varying patterns of internal walls were built to divide up living space further west the settlement of the secret huyuk again shows a different construction pattern with mudbrick dwellings being built directly onto the ground in groups of five or six unlike contemporary settlements in anatolia these buildings contain no obvious entrance way and appear to have been accessed either by window-like entryways or rooftop portals and alongside these rectangular dwellings new forms of decoration also appear throughout much of the near east the walls and floors of dwellings were increasingly coated in a form of white plaster this plaster which was derived from burning limestone would have been refreshed on a regular basis building up many layers over the course of a building's lifespan these changes in construction pattern would certainly have allowed for increased density but how would these enlarged sites have been able to produce the amount of food required to support populations in the thousands well to explain this growth in population we must turn our eye to several agricultural developments that marked the beginning of the later pre-pottery neolithic these efforts had already been intensifying over the course of the previous millennium as shown by slow increasing grain and seed size at earlier pre-pottery neolithic settlements such as jerf el amar around the end of this period though communities throughout the hilly regions of northern syria anatolia and on the nearby island of cyprus seem to have changed their focus from exploiting a wide range of plant foodstuffs to a smaller number of more productive species by selectively rearing crops with human preferred characteristics these communities slowly introduce changes in plant structure as an example of this we can point to differences between wild and domestic forms of grain such as wheat and barley in wild cereals grains slowly drop off the ear of the plant as they ripen this trait is an effective one for wild seed dispersal but less attractive to humans wishing to harvest the grain efficiently in domestic bred varieties however the grains remain attached and instead have to be released through a process of violent threshing these resulting adaptations would have allowed these enlarged grains to have been more easily harvested and it is perhaps no coincidence that we see an increase in sickle usage during the same time period similar changes occurred in other crop species and from around 8500 bc we see the emergence of the first recognizably domesticated forms of iron corn and emma wheat barley flax chickpeas lentils and beans and in addition to the emergence of these crops it is also during this period that we start to see the emergence of domesticated forms of animals as we mentioned before communities throughout the near east would have still relied on the hunting of wild game as their main source of meat at the beginning of the later pre-pottery neolithic over the next millennia this would change with settlements increasingly coming to rely on domesticated herds for meat and other animal products as with crops before them this process of animal domestication was a gradual one and involved a variety of challenges for a start only a limited number of animal species in this region would have been suited for domesticated life many migratory species that made up the backbone of hunter-gatherer diets in the near east such as gazelle do not fare well in a captive environment with their offspring often suffering from stunted growth and infertility other species are simply too dangerous to be managed by humans in a domestic environment or lack traits that make them appealing for food production as such human efforts seem to have increasingly focused on a small number of suitable species including the ancestors of sheep goats cattle and pigs these efforts would likely have begun as simple herding of wild animals by hunter-gatherers who would have occasionally called weaker members of the herd over time however this passive management slowly became more involved in particular we start to see the widespread culling of juvenile males by these communities only a small number of whom are required to support domestic herds slowly the distant animals were herded over decreased until we see evidence of animals being kept in fixed pens and sustained by fodder isolated from wild populations the reproductive decisions of these animals would then have been increasingly been manipulated by humans to encourage their preferred traits the culmination of this process was the appearance of recognized with domesticated animals during the early stages of the later pre-pottery neolithic displaying such features as reduced brain and body size smaller horns and tusks and increased docility as we mentioned in our last episode this process of domestication may or may not have been intentional certainly there is no evidence of any grand plan by the peoples in this region to develop these domesticated breeds of plants and animals instead the current evidence is that these breeds were developed as the result of many small independent steps that occurred at several different locations throughout the near east but intentional or not the appearance of these domesticated breeds of plants and animals and the developed farming economies that emerged alongside them allowed a vast increase in the carrying capacity of settlements throughout the near east over the next few centuries the proportion of meat gathered through hunting declined by 7500 bc most communities had fully switched over to mixed farming economies large flocks of sheep and goats became the backbone of the economy at many of these sites and herds of domesticated cattle and pigs also appear at settlements throughout northern syria and southeastern turkey it is at this point when we have seen the completion of the transition from hunter-gatherer communities to settlements reliant on farming for survival that we should ask an important question why should humans adopt agriculture in the first place there seems to be something of a common assumption that the farming lifestyle was naturally easier than that of a hunter-gatherer but since the 1960s studies on modern hunter-gatherer groups have found that the lifestyles of early farmers were likely far more labor-intensive than those of contemporary hunter-gatherer groups who would have been able to gather all their required resources in less time the population size of hunter-gatherer groups also seems to reach more of an equilibrium with their local environment corresponding to the availability of resources within their territory comparison the fixed settlements increase population growth associated with the adoption of farming is often seen to require ever more intense exploitation of the surrounding land in order to maintain this in turn would have required greater labor by the inhabitants indeed the skeletons of many men and women from these early farming communities show signs of physical changes brought on by the many hours of labour required to harvest and process large amounts of cereals by hand the sedentary towns associated with early agriculture also seem to be more associated with increased rates of disease and vermin and larger settlements would also have encountered significant problems associated with waste disposal and water drainage that's not to say that there are dangers associated with being a hunter-gatherer after all these communities are dependent on whatever seasonal resources are available for survival but in case of these resources becoming scarce hunter-gatherers could simply move elsewhere in search of more fruitful prospects a luxury that farming communities no longer possessed [Music] so in light of the disadvantages of an early farming lifestyle why should a society adopt agriculture many earlier theories had posited that its adoption would have been quickly brought on by dramatic changes in climate such as the younger dryers all that agriculture was fundamentally more desirable than a hunter-gatherer lifestyle after the 1960s however archaeologists such as louis binford have suggested that the adoption of farming came about due to the establishment of year-round settlements around the end of the last ice age these settlements would have experienced increased population growth compared to their nomadic precursors forcing them to exploit a greater range of local resources until full adoption of agriculture was required to sustain them however as archaeologist chris skuray notes in his book the human past all this answer ultimately does is shift the debate from why farming to why sedentism and as we have seen when discussing the events of the younger dryas in our previous episode sedentary societies can still revert to be nomadic finally a more recent theory is that whilst an early farming lifestyle would have been unattractive to many people the increased opportunities for feasting that it brought may well have been attractive to certain powerful individuals within their societies who would have used these occasions to improve their own social status ultimately however we have to say that currently there is no single theory that fully explains the adoption of agriculture the communities of the near east would continue to grow in size as the later pre-pottery neolithic continued by the midpoint of the 8th millennium bc we see the increasing concentration of populations in the levant and anatolia with a small number of mega sites at many centres the speed of population growth outstrips the normal birth rate and the concurrent abandonment of many surrounding settlements suggests that their populations were increasingly migrating to these large conglomerations in southern anatolia the site of the secret hoyuk grew to house several thousand people before its eventual abandonment with its population being supported by large herds of sheep and copious harvesting of cereals in the levant the vegetarian gazelle also began to expand over the next few centuries the site would evolve into a town that covered some 15 hectares in area that would have housed some 2 000 people at its peak this later site is some four times larger than the contemporary settlement of jericho and indeed its increase correlates with a drop-off in population both there and at a number of other communities throughout eastern jordan and whilst navali chore seems to have been abandoned around 8000 bc the settlement at chanu continued to grow and prosper until the end of the pre-pottery neolithic here the inhabitants would have relied primarily on the management of early pigs though evidence of domesticated aurochs and sheep have also been found on the site and with this expansion in settlement size we also see changes in ritual building behavior throughout the near east in our last episode we detailed the role of the ceremonial complex constructed at gobekwu tepe during the earlier pre-pottery neolithic here a number of large enclosures were dug into the bedrock of a limestone ridge the walls and centers of which were dominated by t-shaped pillars covered in carvings of wild animals currently it is theorised that these enclosures would have acted as a common ritual center for the surrounding communities though the exact nature of their use remains unknown as we reach the later pre-pottery neolithic however we begin to see changes in building practices amongst the peoples of this region rather than continuing to rely on this site the communities of southeastern anatolia increasingly seem to have turned their focus to dedicated ritual buildings set within their own settlements examples of these communal buildings had previously been found at a small number of sites in the earlier pre-pottery neolithic such as those unearthed at jeff el amar and wadi fernan throughout the later pre-pottery neolithic however this practice of communal building becomes ever more the norm this is best illustrated at the settlement of nevali chori where a rectangular stone building bearing much of the iconography associated with the gobekli tepe enclosures was discovered in the early 1980s in addition to containing a fired lime floor similar to that of enclosure b at gobekli tepe this building also contains the remains of two centrally erected t-shaped pillars along with similar pillars embedded in the surrounding wall whilst the heads of these pillars have long since been destroyed the main bodies of one of them still displays the human-like features seen carved into some of the pillars of gobekli tepe including arms hands and loincloths alongside the building unearthed at navali chori t-shaped pillars have also been unearthed at a number of other sites within a radius of gobek with tepe whilst ritual buildings dating from this period have also been found at a number of sites throughout the near east at chayunu to the north east the complex of three rectangular buildings has been unearthed one of which contains three stone monoliths larger communal buildings are also known as a sequoia hoyuk in west anatolia though whether they had any ritual use is still debatable similar rectangular buildings have also been found at iron gazelle and jericho in the southern levant at iron gaza in particular the rectangular building contains a set of standing stones not this similar from those found at chayunu along with a half and what has been interpreted as a floor alta by archaeologists in addition to these buildings large numbers of what have been termed ancestor statues have also been found buried in two pits nearby these remarkable statues stand up to three feet in height and consist of a combination of anthropomorphic figures and a set of busts bearing either one or two heads built over a bundled reed core these statues were constructed using layers of thick plaster onto which were painted patterns resembling clothes and hair special attention was also paid to the statue spacers which contain carefully molded eyes outlined in bitumen in addition to the 30 statues on earth to tie in gazelle fragments of these figures have also been found at jericho suggesting strong cultural bonds between these sites finally at gobekwitepie itself we see the large circular enclosures of the earlier pre-pottery neolithic give way to smaller enclosures and rectangular buildings containing pillars similar to those found in a valley chore archaeologists at the site have interpreted these ritual changes as being intrinsically linked to the transition between hunting and agriculture in the surrounding communities notably the pillars seen in these later buildings are significantly smaller than those of the earlier enclosures and contain far fewer examples of wild animal iconography perhaps indicating that the importance of the species they depict had declined with the coming of agriculture other communal buildings that go beckwith tepe during this period also show evidence of having been used for large-scale grain processing another sign the communities that used it were moving away from hunting activity soon after the great site seems to have lost its relevance and its enclosures were buried in the layers of rock and soil people moved away and the hunter's sanctuary was forgotten so by the midpoint of the 8th millennium bc it seems that for most communities throughout the near east the balance had clearly swung away from hunting towards reliance on domesticated plants and animals even so we must note that hunting didn't simply vanish in fact at many sites hunting activity seems to have retained a degree of ritual significance outside of day-to-day food production and it is also important to note that whilst we see less of an emphasis on wild animal iconography at many of the ritual buildings of this period figurines of long-horned animals such as aurochs goats and gazelle continue to be produced at many centres throughout the near east italian gaza in the southern levant some 150 of these animal figures have been unearthed the majority of which consist of carvings of aurochs that share common features similar figures have been unearthed at sites such as tawaswad and further north at tel sabi abyad there is even some limited evidence of cattle veneration within ritual buildings of this period as seen by the auroch skull unearthed within one of the three central structures at chaunu but there is one site in particular where there is evidence that the hunting of wild cattle continue to haul a central ritual role long after the adoption of domesticated animals it is also at this site that we see urban living on an unprecedented scale and to see it in operation we must travel west to the conure plain of southern anatolia discovered in the late 1950s by archaeologist james mellat the settlement of chateau hoyak provides us with a unique insight into early urban living established on the plains of the dried out kanye lake around 7100 bc its slate pre-pottery neolithic mound covers an area of some 13 hectares and may have housed as many as 8 000 people at its peak as with the other enlarged settlements of the near east the growth of this centre coincides with a drop in population at nearby sites such as the sikley and keffer hoyuk suggesting that many of their residents relocated to chateau hoyok around the end of the 8th millennium bc contained within its mound are some 18 successive archaeological layers each of which consists of the remains of tightly packed rectangular houses similar to those found as the earlier settlement of the sikley hoyuk these houses lack any obvious ground level entrances and instead it is hypothesized that they would have been accessed by a ladder through rooftop openings each building seems to have remained in use for several decades and after its use was discontinued the support beams of its roof were withdrawn collapsing it inwards after the upper walls were demolished a new dwelling would be built over the remains sealing the occupation layer below this process preserved much of the remains within and has allowed archaeologists to reconstruct much of their layout to the best of our knowledge the houses at chateau hoyuk seemed to have followed something of a stereotyped room layout each house was structured around a rectangular main room the floors and walls of which painted with a white plaster made from alluvium dug out of the dried up cogna lake bed this room was entered through a roof hatching ladder below which a clay oven and half were usually placed to allow for ventilation other areas associated with food preparation and domestic life were concentrated around the same side of the room as the half while side rooms seem to have housed large containers used to store grain it is the contents of the far side of these rooms however as have received by far the most attention that's because unlike other settlements throughout the near east chatelhooya contains no central buildings associated with ritual behavior instead the evidence indicates that its people would have integrated ritual behavior into their own homes this combination of the ritual and domestic spheres can be seen in the areas of houses furthest from the halves here a series of low platforms were constructed many of which contain elaborate shrines dedicated to ritual images of wild animals in addition to the sculpted heads of bulls and goats many of which are modeled around the bones of the creature being depicted we also see full-size reliefs depicting leopards an animal that seems to held a special ritual significance at the site these shrines also frequently include depictions of enigmatic human-like figures modeled into the walls characterized by up-term limbs and circular abdominal markings these figures were interpreted by the site's original excavator james mellat as representing a female deity in line with early finds of sculpted figures also unearthed on the site precise identification was however hampered by the fact that none of these figures facial features have survived more recent work by a team led by professor ian hodder has unearthed a seal stamp that resembles these figures this stamp which clearly represents a bear also contains the upturned forelimbs and abdominal markings that characterize these relief figures and it now seems likely that this is what they are intended to depict in addition to these reliefs animal iconography is also prominently depicted in murals painted onto the walls of many of these rooms these scenes which are traced in red ochre include wild animals such as allrocks red deer and vultures along with human figures engaged in hunting behavior perhaps the most iconic of these wall paintings depicts a large image of a wild aurochs surrounded by human figures wielding bows many of whom seem to be engaged in antagonizing the beast this focus on animal and hunting imagery does however have one notable exception despite the widespread depictions of wild cattle and deer there are no images at all of domesticated animals this absence is a surprising one given that large herds of sheep seem to have made up much of the backbone of the resident's meat supply at chatel higher and it is also known that dogs were kept on site instead these wall art depictions focus almost entirely on wild species as with other neolithic settlements widespread evidence of feasting has also been unearthed on the site the focus of which seems to have been the wild catalan deer seen in the reliefs these feasts may well have been timed with major renovations on the site such as the construction and remodeling of new buildings and alongside this animal imagery a number of clay and stone figurines have also been unearthed many of which were placed in grain storage bins or refuse piles by far the most famous of these figures is what is commonly referred to as the seated woman of chateau hoyer a clay figurine of a corpulent woman seated in the act of giving birth in addition to this pose her hands also rest on the heads of two predatory animals that may be either leopards or lions a symbol referred to for out archaeology as the master of animals motif in addition to this figure large amounts of male and female statues have been unearthed though their number is dwarfed by a vast assemblage of animal figures so how is it that such a mega site came to be established in this region the surrounding conure plane would have received a marginal amount of rainfall at best which would have rendered dry farming difficult this semi-arid environment is rendered even less attractive by the poor soil quality of the dried up plane however there is one major source of water in this region the nearby car samba river this river would have deposited large amounts of silt onto the plane resulting in a swampy area of fertile eluvium on which chateau huyuk was based though prone to flooding this resulting alluvial fan would have been capable of supporting the large amounts of domesticated iron corn and emma wheat that the settlement would have relied on as well as acting as grazing land for domestic animals in addition to its fertile soil this swampy area would also have been rich in resources such as fish nesting birds and reeds that could have been used for weaving mats moving beyond the alluvial fan residents at chateau huyuk would also have had ready access to extensive areas of woodland steppe and riverine forest which would have been rich in wild cattle deer and potential sources of fuel finally it also seems that chateau hoyok would have benefited from being located at a key hub in the large-scale trade networks of the later pre-pottery neolithic we mentioned these networks briefly in our last episode when discussing the seashells found at paleolithic sites far inland and again when discussing the shared symbology seen at sites within a radius of gobekli tepe these networks would have continued to grow throughout the pre-pottery neolithic at chateauhouck we see evidence of exotic trade goods such as baskets and shells from the mediterranean and timber from the far-off taurus mountains these items were likely the result of long-distance exchanges with communities in these areas with whom the people of chateau heuer would have swapped the large amounts of obsidian that have been unearthed on the site this precious material would have been transported from the site of cappadocia some 170 kilometers away to chatelhoyk where it would have been crafted into blades with extremely sharp edges along with early polished mirrors in addition to trading for these regional goods chateau hoyok and other communities throughout anatolia also seem to be part of a much larger network of inter-regional trade evidence of this can be seen in how obsidian sourced from anatolia has also been found in the southern levant and at early sites in southwestern iran where it would have been considered an exotic item a reverse example can also be found in the malacite beads manufactured in southern jordan which would have been sought after throughout the near east access to these rare items would likely have had a ritual significance beyond their practical role acting as a physical embodiment of the relationships between these communities and potentially of their own prestige within the wider network this greater focus on questions of ownership may also explain the appearance of stone seal stamps at the later layers of hoyak which would have been used to imprint simple designs on cloth so we've now examined life in the later pre-pottery neolithic in the context of settlement patterns food acquisition and ritual building but so far we've said comparatively little about the specific rituals practiced by these communities indeed throughout this period we see elaboration of long-running ceremonial practices along with developments entirely new to these increasingly agricultural societies [Music] as we detailed in our last episode ritual behavior associated with death was nothing new to these societies organized human burials date as far back as the upper paleolithic and ritual practices associated with death only intensified during the epipeliolithic throughout the natufian period he also saw greater focus placed on burial rituals alongside a greater variety of grave goods during the later part of this period we also see the emergence of ritual activity centered on the skulls of adult males and females with graves often being reopened after internment to retrieve them [Music] many of these skulls would later be the subject of secondary burials sometimes being reinterred alongside the bodies of other individuals these practices continued throughout the earlier pre-pottery neolithic with scores of special significance being retrieved and kept within communities for prolonged periods of time there is even a small amount of evidence of this skull veneration to be found as gobeko tepe here scraps of skull bone have been found amongst human bones included in the filling materials used to bury the earlier enclosures of these scraps seven carry signs of cut marks and carvings and through careful reconstruction archaeologists have been able to assign these scraps to three separate adult individuals a headless human figure also appears in relief on a pillar in enclosure d standing next to the carving of a large bird that is believed to represent a vulture the body of a headless man was similarly deposited in the subterranean building at jerf el amar towards the end of its lifetime along with a head that was buried in a small pit the entire building was then set alight after which the cavity was filled in during the later pre-pottery neolithic this veneration for the skull intensifies with new decorative practices emerging frequently skulls are found containing replica facial features modelled in plaster which in turn are often painted with red and black pigments in some cases many separate layers of plaster were repeatedly applied to the same skull indicating that these items remained in use for prolonged periods this skull veneration is now known to be a common cultural element throughout much of the pre-pottery neolithic world examples have been found at sites such as jericho and iron gazelle in levant at tel assad in northern syria and at chayunu in the later sites of chatelhook and koskoyuk in southern and southeastern turkey in addition to adult schools by this point schools of all ages can be seen to have undergone ritual treatment at chayunu we see evidence that the substructure of one building in particular was used as a repository for these skulls here free stone cells were unearthed attaining a large amounts of human bones inside one of these cells a number of skulls were heaped up after which a large amount of non-human blood was poured over the pile and much as with the carvings at gobekwe tepe we see headless figures appearing in the wall paintings at chateauhoyok with these figures again being accompanied by vultures the presence of this cult of the skull throughout the near east has aroused much debate what rituals and ideas were associated with them were the individuals these skulls belonged to selected due to their special significance in life are we really seeing the remains of an early elite amongst these societies whose enhanced social status made their schools worthy of being used as items of memory amongst their wider societies alternatively were these individuals picked out for specific facial traits that would have made their skulls more attractive items for decoration the answer is that we simply don't know as for other burial practices during this time the picture is similarly enigmatic in many settlements we see a portion of bodies increasingly placed under the floors of both ritual and domestic buildings often these bodies are found in a crouched or fetal position indicating that they were tightly wrapped in mats or other fabrics prior to deposition at chayunu and nivali chori these bodies were placed within the building's stone substructure autodyne gazelle and a secret hoyuk these bodies appear to be buried directly beneath the floors indeed it has been suggested that one of the reasons for the frequent plastering of floors in many pre-pottery neolithic dwellings may have been to mitigate the effects of the decomposing bodies below at most sites the actual proportion of bodies buried in this manner seems to have been low even at chatel hoyak the majority of bodies still seem to have been disposed of in either middens or an unknown fashion off-site of the bodies that were interred on site the majority are found buried under the ritual platforms found on the far side of the dwellings though children and newborns were sometimes interred near the ovens in particular some of the larger houses within the settlement seem to have been the focus of many of these burials suggesting that either the buildings themselves or the people who dwelled within them bore some special significance these practices may seem grim to our more modern sensibilities but every indication is that the people of this time would have seen nothing unusual about living and sleeping above these burials instead they were likely seen as another important part of the long-running themes of continuity and memory around which many of these communities would have revolved we have now come to the final days of the pre-pottery neolithic this period coincides with a sudden decline in population at many centres throughout the near east perhaps the most dramatic of these can be seen at iron gazelle which saw a rapid decrease in population in the century after 7000 bc in northern syria the population of abu huraira collapsed once more whilst in eastern anatolia chiunu was abandoned instead of super communities we now see the establishment of smaller settlements throughout these regions to the west chateau would persist while longer reaching its peak population around 6500 bc soon after however settlement patterns here also changed with later houses at the site be more spread out the hunting of wild orcs was replaced by domestic cattle herding an elaborate installation of animal parts within households slowly ceased other settlements were also established throughout the neighbouring regions of the conure plain during this time and finally the entire settlement was relocated west around the beginning of the 6th millennium bc hospital due to a change in river course finally the ritual practices the later pre-pottery neolithic also declined and slowly the practice of plastering skulls and burying the dead beneath floors came to an end a number of potential explanations have been posed for this decline in settlement size throughout the near east during the seventh millennium bc one theory is that the overuse of the land around these larger centres would have increasingly degraded its fertility until eventually these sites were left unable to feed their vast populations alternatively it has been argued that these dedicated agricultural societies would have seen increased transmission of inherited wealth compared to hunter-gatherer communities which could have led to older families monopolizing access to fertile farmland faced with this increased inequality it has been theorized that peoples on the edges of society may have reacted by dispersing into smaller more egalitarian communities finally it should also be noted the end of this period coincided with a major change in the climate of the near east this change known as the 8.2 kilo-year event resulted in a drop in global temperatures from around 6500 bc with its effects becoming more severe 300 years later the results of this was that for the next two centuries conditions in the near east seem to have been both cooler and more arid in the face of the resulting four in agricultural capacity large-scale centers such as chateau hoyuk may simply been unable to maintain their population whatever the cause of this decline in centers throughout the near east the result was a change from the mega sites of the later pre-pottery neolithic to a great number of small settlements spread out across a wider range of environments this period which lasted for another 3 000 years is marked by a number of major social and technological developments which would permanently alter the way human societies were organized its beginning is marked by the adoption of a new type of storage container which appeared in the near east from around the midpoint of the 7th millennium bc its appearance had been preempted by that of simple storage containers in a later pre-pottery neolithic that have been carefully shaped out of stone and unfired clay as we enter the 7th millennium bc however fired clay pottery became a distinguishing feature of cultures throughout the ancient near east these containers which were originally hand molded out of clay and then fired in ovens or kilns were used for a wide variety of functions including for storage cooking and for transporting goods over long distances it is important to note that the peoples of this region were not the first to produce pottery in china recognizable pottery shards have been dated back as far as hunter-gatherer at times our story pottery shards have similar been found in the southern sahara dating for around the 10th millennium bc by comparison fired pottery only appears in the ancient near east well after the adoption of mixed farming economies even here this separation is perfect as different settlements are seen to adopt pottery on differing time scales at chateau hoyuk we see shards of pottery appearing in its uppermost layers preceding the appearance of pottery in the levant by centuries these shards which are largely indestructible once buried were often discarded in and around households forming a valuable tool for dating specific buildings and settlements in addition to their day-to-day utility this pottery also began to acquire decorative elements an innovation that would allow us to more accurately track the slow development of cultures throughout these regions for as societies slowly changed over the millennia to come so too did the images and symbols that they painted on these vessels over the course of today's episode we've seen the development of fully-fledged farming economies and urbanized environments throughout the near east from this point onwards communities in this region would become fully reliant on various forms of agriculture for survival a few archaeologists have even argued that sites like chateauhouck and ein gazao go beyond the mere title of the village or town and what they really represent is the world's first known examples of cities it cannot be disputed that these communities were of unprecedented scale and density however it should be noted that these sites show little of the specialist labor and social stratification associated with cities there is also no evidence of a conspicuous ruling class at any of these settlements and outside of a few stamp seals found at a small number of locations there is little evidence of organized administration or writing so at this stage we are yet to observe our two remaining criteria that we outlined for civilization over the course of the pottery neolithic however this would all change that's because whilst it may have been the end for the large-scale urban communities the later pre-pottery neolithic it was not the end for urbanized living as a whole over the next two millennia we again see a large-scale centers emerge throughout syria and the levant at the same time we also see increasingly complex farming settlements emerging throughout the zagros mountains along with on the iranian plateau to the east but all these settlements would pale in comparison to the emerging centers of mesopotamia that's because from the midpoint of the 6th millennium bc we see the spread of agriculture to an area that has previously gone all but unmentioned in this series the alluvial plain of southern iraq it is here on this largely featureless plane that we see the appearance of settlements reliant on complex systems of irrigation that unlocks the potential of the alluvial soil fed by increasingly large agricultural surpluses the next thousand years would see the rapid expansion of these settlements culminating in the appearance of urbanized centers marked by complex social hierarchies by the early fourth millennium bc one of these centers would take precedence over all others developing into the largest settlement the world had yet known and it is here that we will see the emergence of what may be the earliest known system of writing
