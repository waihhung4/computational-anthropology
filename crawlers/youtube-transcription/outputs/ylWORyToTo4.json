"Hi, I\u2019m John Green, this is Crash Course World History,\nand today we\u2019re going to talk about China, which these days is discussed almost constantly on television\nand in newspapers - wait, are they still a thing? So, we used to print information on thinly\nsliced trees and then you would pay someone to take these thinly sliced trees and throw\nthem onto your front lawn, and that\u2019s how we received information. No one thought this\nwas weird, by the way. [theme music] Right, but anyway, you hear a lot about how\nChina is going to overtake the U.S. and bury us under a pile of inexpensive electronics,\nbut I don\u2019t want to address those fears today. Instead, I want to talk about how the\nway you tell a story shapes the story. China was really the first modern state \u2013 by\nwhich I mean it had a centralized government and a corps of bureaucrats who could execute\nthe wishes of that government. And it lasted, in pretty much the same form, from 150 BCE until 1911\nCE, which is technically known as a long-ass time. The Chinese were also among the first people\nto write history. In fact, one of the Confucian Classics is called the Shujing, or Classic\nof History. This is great for us, because we can now see the things that the Chinese\nrecorded as they were happening, but it is also problematic because of the way the story\nis told. So even Me From The Past with his five minutes\nof World History knows that Chinese History is conveniently divided into periods called\nDynasties. Mr. Green, I didn\u2019t even say anything. That\ndoesn\u2019t seem very fair -- Shh! What makes a dynasty a dynasty is that\nit\u2019s ruled by a king, or as the Chinese know him, an emperor, who comes from a continuous\nruling family. As long as that family produces emperors -- and they are always dudes -- No they aren't. First off, there were several\nempress dowagers who wielded tremendous power throughout Chinese history, and there was\none very important full-fledged empress, Empress Wu, who WU-led China for more than 20 years\nand founded her own freaking dynasty! -and those emperors keep ruling, the dynasty\ngets to be a dynasty. So the dynasty can end for two reasons: either\nthey run out of dudes (which never happened thanks to the hard work of many, many concubines),\nor the emperor's overthrown after a rebellion or a war. This is more or less what happened\nto all the dynasties, which makes it easy for me to go over to camera two and describe them\nin a single run-on sentence: Hi there \u2013 camera two. Leaving aside the Xia dynasty, which was sadly\nfictional, the first Chinese dynasty was the Shang, who were overthrown by the Zhou, which\ndisintegrated into political chaos called the Warring States period, in which states\nwarred over periods - oh, no, wait, it was a period in which states warred - which ended\nwhen the Qin emperor was able to extend his power over most of the heretofore warring\nstates, but the Qin were replaced by the Han, which was the dynasty that really set the\npattern for most of China\u2019s history and lasted for almost 400 years after which China\nfell again into political chaos \u2013 which only means there was no dynasty that ruled\nover all of China \u2013 and out of this chaos rose the Sui, who were followed quickly by\nthe Tang, who in turn were replaced, after a short period of no dynasty, by the Song,\nwho saw a huge growth in China\u2019s commerce that was still not enough to prevent them\nfrom being conquered by the Yuan, who were both unpopular and unusual... because they\nwere Mongols- [mongoltage] - which sparked rebellions resulting in the rise of the Ming,\nwhich was the dynasty that built the Great Wall and made amazing vases, but didn\u2019t\nsave them from falling to the Manchus, who founded a dynasty that was called the Qing,\nwhich was the last dynasty because in 1911 there was a rebellion like the ones in, say,\nAmerica, France or Russia, and the whole dynastic system which at this point had lasted for\na long-ass time, came to an end. And... breathe. So that's what happened, but\nwhat's interesting, as far as capital-H History is concerned, is why it happened, and especially\nwhy the people who were writing history at the time said it happened. Which leads us\nto the Mandate of Heaven. So the concept of the Mandate of Heaven dates\nfrom the Zhou Dynasty, and current historians think that they created it to get rid of the\nShang. Before the Zhou, China didn\u2019t even have a concept of \u201cHeaven\u201d or T\u2019ian,\nbut they did have a \u201chigh god\u201d called Shangdi. But the Zhou believed in T\u2019ian, and they\nwere eager to portray the idea of heaven as eternal, so they ascribed the concept of the\nMandate of Heaven back to a time even before the Shang, explaining that the Shang were\nable to conquer the Xia only because the Xia kings had lost the Mandate of Heaven. This,\nof course, would have been impossible, partly because the Xia kings had no concept of \u201cheaven\u201d,\nand partly because, as previously noted, they didn\u2019t exist, but let\u2019s just leave that\naside. The Shujing is pretty specific about what\ncaused the Xia kings to lose the Mandate, by the way, explaining: \u201cThe attack on Xia\nmay be traced to the orgies in Ming Tiao.\u201d Sadly, the Shujing is woefully short on details\nof these orgies, but orgies are the kind of behavior that is not expected of a ruler,\nand therefore Heaven saw fit to come in, remove the Mandate and allow the Shang to take power. But then the Shang lost the Mandate. Why?\nWell, the last Shang emperor was reported to have roasted and eaten his opponents, which,\nyou know, bit of a deal breaker as far as the Mandate of Heaven is concerned. Of course,\nthat might not actually have happened, but it would explain why Heaven would allow the\nZhou to come to power. So basically the fact that one dynasty falls\nand is replaced by another in a cycle that lasts for 3000 years is explained, in the\neyes of early Chinese historians, by divine intervention based on whether the ruler behaves\nin a proper, upright manner. It\u2019s after-the fact analysis that has the virtue of being\ncompletely impossible to disprove, as well as offering a tidy explanation for some very\nmessy political history. And even more importantly, it reinforces a vision of moral behavior that\nis a cornerstone of Confucianism, which I will get to momentarily. But first, let\u2019s see an example of the Mandate\nof Heaven in action. The Qin dynasty on lasted only 38 years, but it's one of the most important\ndynasties in Chinese history, so important in fact that it gave the place its name, \u201cChin-\nuh.\u201d (laughing) Can I just tell you guys, that we literally just spent 20 minutes on\nthat shot? We shot it like 40 times. Stan, you are in love with puns. The accomplishment of the Qin was to re-unify\nChina under a single emperor for the first time in 500 years, ending the warring states\nperiod. As you can imagine, the making of that particular omelette required the cracking\nof quite a few eggs, and the great Qin emperor Qin Shi Huangdi and his descendants developed\na reputation for brutality that was justified. But it was also exaggerated for effect so\nthat the successor dynasty, the Han, would look more legitimate in the eyes of Heaven.\nSo when recounting the fall of the Qin, historians focused on how a bunch of murderous eunuchs\nturned the Qin emperors into puppets, not literal puppets, although that would have\nbeen awesome. And these crazy eunuchs like tricked emperors into committing suicide when\nthey started thinking for themselves, et cetera. So the Mandate of Heaven turned away from\nthese suicidal puppet emperors, which set up a nice contrast with the early Han emperors,\nsuch as Wen, who came to power in 180 BCE and ruled benevolently, avoiding extravagance\nin personal behavior and ruling largely according to Confucian principles. Under Wen, there were no more harsh punishments\nfor criticizing the government, executions declined, and, most importantly for the Confucian\nscholars who were writing the history, the government stopped burning books. Thus, according\nto the ancient Chinese version of history, Emperor Wen, by behaving as a wise Confucian,\nmaintains the Mandate of Heaven. So who is this Confucius I won\u2019t shut up about? Let\u2019s\ngo to the Thought Bubble. Confucius was a minor official who lived during\nthe Warring States period and developed a philosophical and political system he hoped\nwould lead to a more stable state and society. He spent a great deal of his time trying to\nconvince one of the powerful kings to embrace his system, but while none ever did, Confucius\ngot the last laugh because his recipe for creating a functioning society was ultimately\nadopted and became the basis for Chinese government, education, and, well, most things. So Confucius was conservative. He argued that\nthe key to bringing about a strong and peaceful state was to look to the past and the model\nof the sage emperors. By following their example of upright, moral behavior, the Chinese emperor\ncould bring order to China. Confucius\u2019 idea of morally upright behavior boils down to\na person\u2019s knowing his or her place in a series of hierarchical relationships and acting\naccordingly. Everyone lives his life (or her life, but\nlike most ancient philosophical traditions, women were marginalized) in relationship to\nother people, and is either a superior or an inferior. There are five key relationships\n- but the most important is the one between father and son, and one of the keys to understanding\nConfucius is filial piety - a son treating his father with reverential respect. The father is supposed to earn this respect\nby caring for the son and educating him, but this doesn\u2019t mean that a son has the right\nto disrespect a neglectful father. Ideally, though, both the father and the son will act\naccordingly: the son will respect the father, and the father will act respectably. Ultimately, the goal of both father and son\nis to be a \u201csuperior man\u201d (Junzi in Chinese). If all men strive to be Junzi, the society\nas a whole will run smoothly. This idea applies especially to the emperor, who is like the\nfather to the whole country. Oh, it\u2019s time for the Open Letter? Alright. God, that\u2019s good. But first, let\u2019s see\nwhat\u2019s in the Secret Compartment today. Oh, an iPhone? Stan, this doesn\u2019t factor\ninto Chinese history until much later. An Open Letter to the Xia Dynasty. Dear Xia Dynasty, Why you gotta be so fictional? You contain all of the most awesome emperors,\nincluding my favorite emperor of all time, Yu the Engineer. There are so many The Greats\nand The Terribles among royalty and so few The Engineers. We need more kings like Yu\nThe Engineer: Peter The Mortgage Broker; Danica The Script Supervisor; Stan The Video Editing\nand Producer Guy. Those should be our kings! I freakin\u2019 love you, Yu The Engineer. And\nthe fact that you\u2019re not real \u2013 it breaks my heart, in a way that could only be fixed\nby Yu The Engineer. The circularity actually reminds me of the Mandate of Heaven. Best wishes, John Green But back to the Junzi: So how do you know\nhow to behave? Well, first you have to look to historical antecedents, particularly the\nsage emperors. The study of history, as well as poetry and paintings in order to understand\nand appreciate beauty, is indispensable for a Junzi. The other important aspects of Junzi-ness\nare contained in the Confucian ideas of ren and li. Ren and Li are both incredibly complex\nconcepts that are difficult to translate, but we\u2019re going to do our best. Ren is usually translated as \u201cpropriety\u201d.\nIt means understanding and practicing proper behavior in every possible situation, which\nof course depends on who you\u2019re interacting with, hence the importance of the five relationships.\nLi is usually translated as \u201critual\u201d and refers to rituals associated with Chinese\nreligion, most of which involve the veneration of ancestors. Which brings us back, in a very roundabout\nway, to the fundamental problem of how early Chinese historians wrote their history. Traditional\nChinese historians were all trained in the Confucian classics, which emphasized the idea\nthat good emperors behaved like good Confucians. Would-be historians had to know these classics\nby heart and they\u2019d imbibed their lessons, chief among which was the idea that in order\nto maintain the Mandate of Heaven, you had to behave properly and not engage in orgies\nor eat your enemies or eat your enemies while engaging in orgies. In this history the political fortunes of\na dynasty ultimately rest on one man and his actions - whether he behaves properly. The\nMandate of Heaven is remarkably flexible as an explanation of historical causation. It\nexplains why, as dynasties fell, there were often terrible storms and floods and peasant\nuprisings... If the emperor had been behaving properly, none of that stuff would have happened. Now, a more modern historian might point out\nthat the negative effects of terrible storms and floods, which includes peasant uprisings,\nsometimes lead to changes in leadership. But that would take the moral aspect out of history\nand it would also diminish the importance of Confucian scholars. Because the scholars can tell you that one\nof the best ways to learn how to be a good emperor, and thereby maintain the Mandate\nof Heaven, is to read the Confucian Classics, which were written by scholars. In short, the complicated circularity of Chinese\nhistory is mirrored by the complicated circularity of the relationship between those who write\nit and those who make it. Which is something to think about no matter what history you\u2019re\nlearning, even if it\u2019s from Crash Course. Next week we\u2019ll talk about Alexander the\nGrape\u2014 really, Stan, for an entire episode? That seems excessive to me. They\u2019re just\nlike less sour, grapey-er lemonheads - ohhh Alexander the GREAT. That makes more sense.\nUntil then, thanks for watching. Crash Course is produced and directed by Stan\nMuller. Our script supervisor is Danica Johnson. Our graphics team is Thought Bubble, and the\nshow is written by my high school history teacher Raoul Meyer and myself. Last week\u2019s phrase of the week was \"Right\nHere In River City\". If you wanna guess at this week\u2019s phrase of the week or suggest\nfuture ones, you may do so in comments where you can also ask questions about today\u2019s\nvideo that'll be answered by our team of historians. Thanks for watching. As we say in my hometown,\ndon't forget to be awesome! "
