"[Music] [Music] [Music] for [Music] now I swear by the sun god Utah on this very day and my younger brothers shall be witness of it in foreign lands where the sons of Suma are not known where people do not have the use of paved roads where they have no access to the written word that I the firstborn son am a fashioner of words a composer of songs a composer of words and that they will recite my songs as Heavenly writings and that they will bow down before my words these dramatic statements by shuji the second king of yure echo from the Samarian Renaissance period the Renaissance period in Suma was however short-lived kingdoms of Samaria is the story of these mysterious people and their successors it is the story of what they achieved what they preserved and how each one fell from grace before we go there we must address how the samarians actually came into [Music] [Music] being [Music] [Music] suian history is purported to begin around the fifth millennium BC when a people known as the ubed culture established settlements in the region that became known later as Suma these settlements gradually developed into cities becoming the principal Samarian cities of adab eridu isin Kish kab lagash Lassa nepur and Ure at some point the Ade peoples precursor to the group we call Sumerians intermingled they are both mysterious in their own right they're efficiently morphed into one denomination in the 3000 BC era the ubig group are renowned for their serpent-like deities the site where the unusual artifacts were discovered is called Tel alade although figurines have also been found in Ur and eridu the ALU bade site has very little left just a small amount about half a kilm in diameter and 2 m above the ground it was Harry regginald Hal whom in 1919 un earthed male and female figurines they were found in different postures and most of the figurines appear to be wearing a helmet and have padding of some kind on the shoulders other figurines were found to hold a staff or scepter possibly as a symbol of justice and ruling each figurine has a different pose but the strangest of all are the female figurines is nurturing babies suckling milk the child is also represented as a serpent type creature the figurines are always presented with Long Heads almond shaped eyes long tapered faces and a snake-like nose what exactly they represent is completely unknown according to archaeologists their postures such as a female figure breastfeeding do not suggest that they were ritualistic objects so what did these snake like figures represent them whatever they were they appear to have been important to the ancient ubate people we know that the serpent was a major symbol used in many successive cultures to represent a number of gods the Samarian God enki is a prime example the snake being of huge significance in later adaptations to Samaran at the side of CER El Saga which brings us to the samarians in 3,250 BC another mysterious group came to the cities they began to intermar with the native ubate people these people became known as the [Music] samarians [Music] oh [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] interestingly no one can be sure where the Samarian Homeland is when we speak in later periods of Samarian culture in the era of 3,000 BC onwards we are technically speaking of the fusion of the UB and Samarian groups there are claims that they are semites who moved in from the west and there are beliefs that they have migrated from Northeast of Mesopotamia the Semite perspective likely stems from the later influx of amorites the amorites were likely the biblical Giants of Canaan which we'll discuss later there is notably a concerted effort to claim the heritage of the [Music] [Music] samarians [Music] when we look to the Northeast the region of turkistan and Central Asia particularly the Hindu Kush and copc mountains seem incredibly interesting to say the [Music] least we know the samarians had a complete obsession with lapis lazuli the Epic of Gilgamesh even tells us that the mythological beliefs revolve around the mineral lapis they believed their gods in lapis lazuli palaces the sun moon and Venus would rise from the lapis palaces to travel the sky and return to the Palaces at night [Music] Sumerian art is dominant with the mineral lapis lazuli this Samarian commodity has a unique signature only found in one specific place on Earth the sari sang lapis mines which show extensive mining for 6,000 years in the standard of UR shown here now housed in the British museum it demonstrates just how lapis dominated their art we even get another clue in this object to the clothing they wore this combed sheep skin attire unusually unique is reminisent of ancient Turk Manan cultures we see an individual playing an ancient harp on the standard of UR also housed in the British museum this beautiful Samarian harp reconstructed from the stand of imagery with lapis [Music] lazuli from the same archaeological finds we have the delicate Ram in a Thicket a composite of golden lapis an artistic concept of combining these two valuable minerals we see spread as a far as Egypt the ishgar gate now housed in the pergamon museum shows the beautiful lapis glazed tiles it also gives you an idea of the quantity and sheer distance they transported this material Sumerian gods and early statues always depict blue eyes a significant feature in their artistic representation physically and mythologically as their lapis eyes look to the lapis [Music] heavens biogeographic research involving haplo groups does indicate some influence from turkistan but you would expect that if you mined or traded the quantities of lapis there here is the other problem when you look in that region you find ancient settlements and artifacts similar to the UB culture was there an uade influence in Turkmenistan gono tape Anu and other Neolithic settlements are incredibly similar these artifacts of gonot tape show a close resemblance to UB art it really does seem when you go looking for samarians you find the uade culture too which brings us to the same problem of when exactly they fuse together as one culture the only thing we do know for sure is the Samarian language is completely isolate it is as if they were inserted into Mesopotamia fully equipped with an amazing highly evolved skill set trade and commerce can provide interesting evidence but it does not prove Origins it proves how extensive their Trade Network was in the centuries that followed with the immigration of the samarians the country grew rich and Powerful art and architecture crafts religious and ethical thought flourished the Sumerian language became the prevailing speech of the land the people here developed a uniform script the system of writing on Clay the script was to become the basic means of written communication throughout the Middle East for a further 2,000 years [Music] [Music] the rise of the Samarian civilization from obscurity to Enlightenment is phenomenal there is no doubt about that there is no trial and error no evidence of a slowly evolving civilization the Sumerian civilization almost sprung into existence overnight in the space of a relatively small window of time the Leaps and Bounds in technological artistic spiritual and Architectural achievements are breathtaking we desperately cling to discover a trigger for this one particularly bright leader or Visionary doesn't do it there is no evidence for that no influence from another neighboring Advanced Regional culture either it as if the samarians were svants from day one the legacy of Samarian sants is highly significant they were Advanced business administrators and used a system of counting based on the unit 60 the sex agmal system rather than the decimal system which is based on the unit 10 the sex aimal system is still used today in Computing divisions of time 60 seconds to a minute 60 minutes to an hour a day of 24 hours and a week of 7 days they based their angles divisions of 360 multiples of 60 they also created a Luna calendar attributing more importance on the movements of the Moon unlike the Egyptians who worshiped the sun we know this from their worship of the lunar god Nana in Acadian sin there is an extensive array of data provided by archaeology and Mesopotamian astronomy however the intellectual approach of the Samarian svants has never been analyzed scientifically presumably they observe the Motions of the Moon before the appear of writing the need to record lunations precisely and repeatedly simultaneously gave rise to the invention of time and writing this was an incredibly important step in abstract thought the abstract thought didn't stop there recently discovered evidence shows they tracked the motion of Jupiter using a precursor to Modern calculus the area under a curve Babylonian astronomers used simple arithmetic to predict to the positions of celestial bodies they also employed sophisticated geometric methods that foreshadow the development of calculus historians had thought such techniques did not emerge until 14th century [Music] Europe [Music] although the tablets proed lianes and Newton merely rediscovered calculus the revelations didn't stop there Matthew ausen driver of humbal University in Berlin bases his findings on a reexamination of clay tablets dating from 350 BC to 50 BC they even contained instructions for constructing a trapezoidal figure it was assumed unrelated to anything astronomical ausen driver studied two other tablets that also prescribed the drawing of a trapezoid and in these he thought he difference to Jupiter the giant planet was an obsession among the Babylonians who aced this planet with their main god maduk the actual Patron deity of the city of Babylon but the Jupiter link was tentative retired a serologist Herman hunger of the University of Vienna visited ausen driver bringing photos taken decades ago of an uncataloged Babylonian tablet from the British museum that described some of the astronomical computation alone in his office a few months later Austin driver perused the photos images were blurry and the inscription slanted making them hard to read but he realized the numbers were identical to those in the troid inscriptions he had been scrutinizing by comparing the photos with fragments of other Babylonian texts he discovered that the computations described the Motions of Jupiter examining all of the tablets at the British museum ausen driver figured out that the trapezoid calculations were a tool for calculating Jupiter's displacement each day along the elliptic the path that the Sun appears to trace through the Stars the computations recorded on the tablet covered a period of 60 days beginning on a day when the giant planet first appeared in the night sky Just Before [Music] Dawn during that interval Jupiter's motion across the sky appears to slow such erratic apparent motion stems from the complex combination of Earth's Own orbit around the sun with that of Jupiter a graph of Jupiter's apparent velocity Against Time slopes downwards so that's theend area under the curve forms the magic trapezoid the area of the trapezoid in turn gives the distance that Jupiter has moved along the elliptic During the 60-day period calculating the area under a curve to determine a numerical value is a basic operation known as the integral between two points in calculus discovering that the Babylonians understood this was the real aha moment delving into older purely mathematical Babylonian texts written between 1800 B.C and 1600 BCE which also described computations with a trapezoid he realized that the astronomers who made the tablets had gone a step further to compute the time at which Jupiter would have moved halfway along its elliptic path the astronomers divided the 60-day trapezoid into two smaller ones of equal area the vertical line dividing the two trapezoids marked the halfway [Music] time because of the different shapes of the trapezoids it indicated not 30 days but slightly fewer the Babylonians had developed abstract mathematical geometrical ideas about the connection between motion position and time that are so common to any modern physicist or mathematician their presence testifies to the Revolutionary Brilliance of the unknown Mesopotamian Scholars who constructed Babylonian mathematical astronomy after cuniform died out around 100 AD Babylonian astronomy was thought to have been virtually forgotten it was left to French and English philosophers and mathematicians in the late Middle Ages to literally reinvent what the Babylonians had invented developed and ritually practiced as far back as 1800 BC without doubt learning how the Babylonian astronomers acquired their geometric Acumen their mathematical prowess their abstract reasoning would tell us something about why human beings do science in the first place the legacy of Sumerian civilization was completely adopted in its entirety by Babylon the only thing we can say for sure is that the trail of the svants in this region on the level of Newton goes back to 1800 BC as a minimum [Music] the Samarian Kuni form writing was a revolution every conquering Kingdom of Samaria adopted it it is even thought to have inspired Egyptians to create their own script it spread geographically and was to be used by the later Persian Empire while the technical inventions of the potis wheel and the wheel cart appear to have emerged from Samarian civilization it is the successive Babylonian astronomers who preserved their mathematics and number system the 23rd Century BC the power of the samarians had declined to such an extent that they could no longer defend themselves against foreign invasion the cause of this was the endemic problem that besets most great civilizations internal disputes greed and power struggles so weak had the country become that the sematic ruler sagon the great in the 24th century BC succeeded in conquering the entire country Saron founded a new capital called aade in the far north of Suma and made it the richest and most powerful City in the then Known World the people of Northern Suma and the conquer Invaders eventually interbred and the people became known as acadians the land of Suma acquired the composite name Suma and aad this young civilization was not to flourish however and another race of people the elamites from Modern Day Iran attacked around 2004 BC Conquering the principal city of UR it was in turn sacked and burned but later rebuilt by the Babylonians during the next centuries inter city struggles for the control of Suma and aad occurred it was hamurabi of Babylon became the sole ruler of Suma and aad around 1763 BC this stally marks the end of the Sumerian State Sumerian civilization however was adopted in its entirety by Babylon which brings us back to the Jupiter cuniform tablet this war time of hamurabi 1,800 BC was not the time to invent calcul like everything else it was a Sumerian gift to the world and the successive Babylons simply preserved it the samarians completely disappeared as a people their language lived on as a language of culture while their writing their business organizations their scientific knowledge and their mythology spread Westward by the Babylonians and Assyrians if it were not for the Babylonian record Keepers we may have never known the profound level of mathematics they acquired [Music] there is a mate to their scientific and Legacy and the basic the Sumerian number system the Jupiter calculation tablet even used uses a 60-day count they were obsessed with a unit 60 it was simply embedded in their thought process nobody explains professionally why they were calculating the precise position of Jupiter or why they used the base 60 system in the first place it is waved of a Superstition by the very science journals that published the find because Jupiter is associated with their God M duck this advanced math is regulated to the superstitious Astron asy and manen's Department true there was no segregation between astrology and astronomy in all ancient cultures the Babylonian Kings likely utilize their astronomers and mathematicians to give Omens and divination at times to demonstrate that power and [Music] Prestige procession of the equinoxes the motion of the equinoxes along the plane of Earth's orbit must have been known for centuries it has an incredible link to the base 60 system that is never addressed in compiling his famous star catalog completed in 1,29 BC the Greek astronomer hipparchus noticed that the position of the Stars was shifted in a systematic way from earlier Babylonian measures despite this known fact the Greeks are still accredited with discovering procession this indicated that it was not the stars that were moving but rather the observing platform Earth such a motion is called procession and consists of a cycle wobbling with a period of 25,920 years this gives the FED 12 zodiacal ages of 2,160 years a piece the 12 zodiacal ages that make up 25,920 is often referred to as the great year amazingly the great year is exactly divisible by 60 432 divisions of 60 to be precise each zodiacal age for example the age of Aquarius the age of Pisces is 2,160 and also exactly divisible by 60 6 * 6 * 60 or 6 * 360 simply speaking if you wanted to choose a number system to deal with calculating procession 60 is the number one choice procession in solar years is a natural base 60 system if you have 100 cents to a dollar and 100 people to give it to you simply would use the decimal system cuz it's intuitively natural to do so you can break up the day into as many hours as you want it's arbitrary really the same goes for hours minutes and seconds however there is a dedicated number of solar years within the great year of procession and that number happens to be divisible by 60 for the Samarian sants and their intellectually absorbent successive kingdoms they must have known this and likely built their math system around it they certainly studied the stars for centuries seeing a long cycle like procession is a given considering the Greeks used their data to discover it for [Music] [Music] themselves in Hamlet's Mill author santaana and bond shend state that ancient myths have no historical basis but a cosmological one Based On A Primitive form of astrology they recognize the importance of the helac rising constellations as markers for the astrological ages and claimed that knowledge of this phenomenon had been known for thousands of years previously the heliacal rising of a constellation is the rising of the constellation at sunrise on the Equinox essentially we get a new one every 2,160 years and we go through the 12 of these until we come full [Music] circle they claim that to understand ancient things thinking it is necessary to understand astrology not to the modern sunshine or horoscopic astrology but to the astrology of ancient times which was the common language [Music] then they go further and state that our knowledge of the dawn of astrology and its relationship to ancient myths and star names is limited to about 2,100 BC during the Nance of Sumerian culture instead of being able to examine the real old material on it author Philip Drummond makes his case that at the time of Abraham the amorites first recorded the shift from the age of Taurus to the age of Aries as represented by the year commencing with the ram Aries rather than the bull Taurus the Book of Joshua indicates that by the time of Moses the equinoxes had already shifted from Taurus Aries as Moses had ordained that the Civil year should commence with the month of Nissan Aries rather than the month of T the Feast of Paso probably a Cel the age of Aries with a passal lamb ative of Aries additionally ass with a symbol Ram or [Music] sheep the Sumerians weren't all science either in the Arts they created a rich Legacy of literature three of which deal with the story of creation an epic of the flood very similar in many ways the biblical story of Noah and the epic poem of Gilgamesh Gilgamesh being two3 God and 1/3 man is the classic hero of Mesopotamian literature a majestic powerful figure pressing the Gods in vain for the secret of immortality it's worth noting that the whole reason Sumerian script was decoded was due to George Smith who recognized the biblical flood narrative in the Sumerian writing as for their scripture and architecture it was so well developed with their strikingly impressive temples or ziggurats dominating the landscape they really did have it all the nomadic Amorite tribes the relentlessly tried to penetrate this region really couldn't resist having a piece of the intellectual action tracing the legacy of the Sumerian sants through each successive culture in the region is made easier as they all pretty much adopt The Genius of this Genesis culture after having taken control the amorites adopted many Samarian cultural ways just as the acadians had done before them they were assimilated into the ex existing culture rather than replacing which have been so firmly entrenched for a thousand years or more the amorites were Astic people who seem to have emerged from Western Mesopotamia modern day Syria at some point prior to the third millennium BCE in Samarian they were known as the Maru or the tium in the U 3 period in acadium by the name of Amaro and in Egypt as Amar all of which mean westerners or those of the West as does the Hebrew name Amorite they worshiped their own Pantheon of gods with a chief deity named amaru also known as biladi lord of the mountains whose wife belet Siri was Lady of the desert which also became a designation for the people as the acadians also referred to them as people of amaru and to the region of Syria as amaru there is no record of what the amorites called [Music] themselves the god amaro's associations with the mountains and his wife with the desert suggest that they may have originated in the area of Syria around Mount Herman but this is unsubstantiated their Origins are unknown and their precise history until they settled in cities like m is e mysterious the the amorites were giants is supported by the the report of the spies who Moses sent through the land of Canaan the amorites were one of the people groups they saw numbers 1329 and they claimed that all the people whom we saw in it are men of great stature numbers [Music] 1332 from their first appearance in the historical record the amorites had a profound impact on the history of Mesopotamia and are probably best known for their Kingdom of Babylonia under the Amorite King hamurabi the span between 2,00 and 1600 BCE in Mesopotamia is known as the Amorite period during which their impact on the region can most clearly be discerned but there is no doubt that they influenced the people of the various cities long before that time and their impact was felt long after in search of the origins of the samarians it is a process of gathering data on the individual cultures who interacted interbred conquered and inevitably fused into one the fusion of uade the Sumerians and the amorites are essentially the recipe that one must distill to single out who these people were the amorites first appear in history as Nomads who regularly made incursions from the West into established territories and King K Doms the amorites were semi-nomadic groups from northern Syria whom Babylonian literature described in extremely negative [Music] terms the Amorite he is dressed in sheep skins he lives in tents in Wind and Rain he doesn't offer sacrifices armed Vagabond in the Steep he digs up Truffles and is restless he eats raw meat lives his life without a home and when he dies he is not buried according to proper rituals the bizarre element is that if you read this negative Babylonian opinion of the amorites you would think that they would be the last people to preserve science literature astronomy or astrology however the amorites may have simply inherited the knowledge of the samarians preserved it for their own motives misusing science and technology has never ceased to this day it is likely the astronomical Omens attributed to the math calculations of heavenly bodies was done under Jess you don't simply wake up one day decide to invent calculus to deliver Omen about your gar duck there is a corruption in the scientific motives somewhere you develop the science the math and then you see what use it can be put to the motive of the amorites was likely one of control of the population and likely far removed from the original Samarian astronomers a notable example of this is the enuma Anu and a major series of 68 or 70 tablets depending on the Ascension dealing with Babylonian astrology the series would probably compiled in its canonical form during the cite period 1595 to 1157 BCE but there was certainly some form of prototype enuma Anu enil current in the old Babylonian Amorite period 1950 to 1595 BCE continued in use into the first Millennium theable Copy being 10 bcee It is believed that the first 49 tablets were transmitted to India in just fourth or 3r centuries BCE and that the final tablets dealing with the Stars had also arrived in India just before the start of the Common Era there was a remarkable preservation process happening lasting centuries the term Amorite may not have originally referred to a specific ethnic group but any nomadic people who threatened the stability of established communities even if this is so at some point Amorite came to designate a certain tribe of people with a specific culture based on a nomadic lifestyle of living off the land and taking what was needed from the communities they encountered they grew more powerful as they acquired more land until finally they directly threatened the stability of those in the established cities of the region this situation came to crisis during the latter part of the ear third period also known as the Sumerian Renaissance 247 to 1750 BCE King Shuli and the samian City of er constructed a wall 155 Mi 250 km long specifically to keep the amorites out of Suma the war W was too long to be properly manned however and also presented the problem of not being anchored at either end to any kind of obstacle an invading Force could simply walk around the wall to bypass it and that seems to be precisely what the amorites did Amorite incursions led to the weakening of ER and Suma which encouraged the region of a lamb to mount an invasion and break through the [Music] wall the sack of UR by the elamites in 1750 BCE ended Sumerian civilization but this was made possible by the earlier incursions of the amorites and their migrations throughout the region which undermined the stability and trade of the Cities following the sack of ER in 1750 BCE the amorites merged with the Samarian population in southern Mesopotamia they had already been established in the cities of Mari and EA in Syria and had ruled in Babylon since Circa 1984 BCE the Amorite King sin muet had assumed the throne in Babylon in 18 12 BCE he was succeeded by his son Amari who is better known by his Acadian name amabi the fact that an Amorite king ruled in Babylon prior to the fall of Earth supports the claim that not all amorites were amorites and that as previously mentioned the term was used rather Loosely to refer to any nomadic tribe in the near East the amorites of Babylon seem to have been regarded positively in the region while the roaming amorites continue to be a source of stability the amorites of Babylon just as those who inhabited other cities worshiped Sumerian gods and wrote down Sumerian myths and legends the only thing we can say for sure on the origins of the samarians is that there are Trails of evidence their science was extremely high at the very beginning of their appearance in Suma the uade and amorites of equally mysterious Origins and at times difficult to separate amazingly there are over million uniform tablets discovered to date the majority are waiting to be translated there are undoubtedly answers in them waiting to be [Music] [Music] discovered [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] in kingdoms of Samaria origins of the samarians evance we neglected to mention what the samarians wrote themselves about their own Origins like the many ancient cultures they have a bizarre creation myth on their Origins now housed in the ashmolean museum in Oxford we have one of the most important writings preserved on this very issue the Samaran King list as it is commonly known delivers an astonishing backdrop to The Saga this Samaran King list however still confounds historians after More Than A Century of [Music] research there are many Renditions of this incredible artifact that have been recovered from various ancient sites where flourishing cities once [Music] stood the list is an ancient manuscript originally recorded in the Samaran language listing Kings of Suare from neighboring dynasties their supposed rain lengths and the locations of quote official unquote kingship what makes this artifact so unique is the fact that the list Blends apparently mythical pre-dynastic rulers with historical rulers who are known to have existed the term mythical rulers and the term historical rulers are terms used by pure academic historians to counteract what they do not fully understand regarding the length of rign these Sumerian rulers had essentially what historians cannot prove or they don't believe to be true is classed as mythology an effective tool to restore their academic and intellectual prowess rather than simply State they do not know something that said the mythologists cannot claim that everything in motaman mythology is based in theology or religious rituals either as you're about to see the truth might be that both the historians and the mythologists may be right it's just the extreme prejudice perspective of each side claiming the knowledge without looking at the details with an open mind the first fragment of this rare and unique text a 4,000-year-old uniform tablet was found in the early 19 1900s by German American Scholar Herman hilp at the site of ancient nepur his findings were later published in 1906 since Hil pri's Discovery at least 18 other exemplars of the king's List have been found most of them dating from the second half of the I Dynasty Circa 2017 to 1794 BCE no two of these documents are identical however there's enough common material in all versions of the list to make it clear that they're derived from a single as historians put it idealistic account of Sumerian history among all the examples of the Sumerian king list the W Blundell prism in the ashmolean museum uniform collection Oxford represents the most extensive version as well as the most complete copy of the king [Music] list the 8 in high prism contains four sides with two columns on each side it's believed that it originally had a wooden spindle going through its Center so it could be rotated in red on all four sides it lists rulers from the anti- deluvian that is Before the Flood dynasties to the 14th ruler of the I and Dynasty Circa 1700s BC the list is of a immense value because it reflects Vari old traditions well at the same time providing an important chronological framework relating to the different periods of kingship in Samaria it even demonstrates remarkable parallels to accounts in Genesis so just how ancient is the ancient civilization of su su sometimes called Samaria is the site of the earliest known civilization located in the southernmost part of Mesopotamia between the Tigris and the Euphrates rivers this area later became Babylonia and modern day Southern Iraq from Baghdad to the Persian Gulf by the thirdd millennium BC Su was the site of at least 12 separate city states Kish IR U Sapar akek Lorac nepur adab Uma Lagos bad tiira and Larsa each of these states comprised a walled City and its surrounding Villages and land and each worshiped its own deity whose Temple was the central structure of the city political power originally belonged to the citizens but as rivalry between the various city states increased each adopted the institution of kingship [Music] [Music] the sumarian king list records that eight Kings reigned before a great flood After the flood various city states and their dynasties of Kings temporarily gained power over the others let us now address sumeria's apparently mythical past the Sumerian king list begins with the very origin of kingship which is seen as a Divine institution quote the kingship had descended from Heaven unquote the rulers in the earliest dynasties are not only represented as reigning Fantastical lengthy periods but have origins in the heavens above this is a major clue that everyone has overlooked because it's been labeled as religious or mythical after the kingship descended from Heaven the kingship was in IDU in IDU Alum became king he ruled for 28,800 years alar ruled for 36,000 years two kings they ruled for 64,800 years some of the rulers mentioned in the early list such as itana lugalbanda and Gilgamesh are mythical or legendary figures whose heroic Feats are subjects of a series of Samarian and Babylonian narratives they are now legendary compositions of writing the early List names eight Kings with a combined total of 24 31,200 years from the time when kingship quote descended from Heaven unquote to the time when the flood unquote swept over the land and once more the kingship was lowered from Heaven unquote After the flood there may well have been two historical floods the ancient biblical flood possibly remote Antiquity and a 4500 BC era flood and extremely well-preserved intact uid skeleton from a flood layer is Testament to this skeleton of a 12-year-old Samaran boy from the pergamon museum in Berlin May hold the answers a complete skeleton from the Sumerian capital of er dating back to around 4500 BC was recently rediscovered in the Penn Museum its intact teeth may include enough soft tissue to allow DNA test nicknamed Noah the skeleton appears to have survived an ancient flood and everything that followed the lower and she said I have this mystery skeleton that I have not been able to identify for the past 30 years we should go and look at it so we went found the crate opened it up and compared it to the field notes and the field photographs and we had a match be careful near the nails I think that he is a it looks to me based on the skeletal indicator as I can see a healthy individual who died at a reasonably old age for people who lived at that time I think it's super interesting because of the relative Rarity essentially of skeletons coming from that place in that time period and it's old okay it can give us a lot of details about life life history of the person who lived at that time can give us details you know essentially about uh health and disease in that time but you can see that it's ented until recently the primary advocates for testing surian DNA have been the followers of Zechariah sit who hold the belief that the ancient Sumerians may have carried non-terrestrial genes but there are plenty of more conventional reasons to study suian DNA it stands to tell us where the first city builders came from and who are their contemporary Descendants the migration of the Sumerians is one of the great Untold Stories of human civilization if we aim to tell it DNA is the best tool we [Music] [Music] have and so what you just watched was us bringing it into conservation because without actually having their professional word on how to maintain it how to keep it we um really can't move forward with our analyses what we're going to do as conservators is uh do what we can to make the body more um available for research especially with archaeological skeletal material we follow a a real philosophy of minimum intervention we're not going to do anything more than we absolutely have to to make them stable and available for study and that's when we form basically kind of a scientific team and what we've you know attempted to do with these teams and again you know being part of the University of Pennsylvania and it being our mission you know in education what we'll try to do is incorporate as many students as we can into that process okay and yes we can look at it yes we can say these things we've talked about it's age of death we've talked about the age in which you lived okay we've talked about the sex of the skeleton various structures associated with pathology and disease now how can we contextualize that in the best possible way and that's the science of skeletal studies and archaeology the Pen Museum skeleton is extremely rare and Incredibly significant in the search for human Origins the fact it was lost in their basement misplaced or forgotten for so long is never addressed in fact they think it's cool they quote rediscovered it unquote they're so proud to display this fact it becomes the actual news story instead of testing the DNA of the INTC teeth of one of the most important skeleton finds of the 20 Century instead the only thing they say they're going to do is conserve it now let us discuss the academic interpretation of long Reigns Before the Flood the amazingly long tenure of the early Kings has provoked many attempts at interpretation at one extreme is the complete dismissal of the astronomically large figures as as completely artificial and the view that they're Unworthy of sincere consideration at The Other Extreme is the belief that the numbers have a basis in history that the early kings were indeed gods and demigods who possessed immortality that they could live much longer periods than mortal humans in between the two extremes is the hypothesis that the figures represent relative power of Triumph or importance in an abstract cont concept the phrase he died aged 130 refers to someone who lived life to the fall and who offered an important contribution to [Music] society in the same way the extremely lengthy periods of rain of the early Kings supposedly represent how incredibly important they were perceived as being in the eyes of the people this doesn't explain however why the periods of tenure later switch to realistic time periods related to this perspective is the belief that although the early kings are historically unattested this does not preclude their possible correspondence with historical rulers who were later mythicized In fairness some Scholars have sought to explain the rulers through a mathematical investigation and [Music] interpretation however the following Reigns were originally measured in Samaran numeral units known as SARS units of 3600 years Nur units of 600 years and SES units of 60 years as we already explained in our episode origins of the saman Savant the base 60 system is a natural unit for processional calculations Scholars historians and mythologists have all converted the original Sumerian units of SARS nurs and sauces into specific numbers of years in doing so they have completely lost themselves in the [Music] data PR is the key to understanding the king's list as it uses sexagesimal units for quote Heavenly Bodies unquote let's have a look at the processional numbers and their relation to Genesis some Scholars have drawn attention to the fact that there are remarkable similarities between the Samaran King list and accounts in Genesis for example Genesis tells the story of the great flood and Noah efforts to save all the species of animals on Earth from destruction likewise in the surian king list there's a discussion of a great Deluge the flood swept over the Earth the Samaran King list provides a list of eight Kings some versions have 10 who reigned for lengthy periods of time before the flood ranging from 18,600 to 43,200 [Music] years the 432 number is a beacon here 432 sauces exactly in a full processional cycle this is also the case in Genesis 5 where the generations from creation to the flood are recorded interestingly between Adam and Noah there are eight Generations just as there are eight Kings between the beginning of kingship and the flood in the Samaran King list this eight numerology is highly significant in further understanding of creation myths as you'll see later after the flood the king list records Kings who ruled for much shorter periods of time thus the Sumerian king list not only documents a great flood early in man's history but it also reflects the same pattern of decreasing longevity as found in the Bible men had extremely long lifespans before the flood and much shorter lifespans following the flood whether real mythical written or [Music] otherwise the Samaran King list when analyzed in purely historical terms is undoubtedly a perplexing mystery why would the samarians combine mythical rulers with actual historical rulers in one document why are there so many similarities with Genesis why were ancient Kings described as ruling for thousands of years why do we assume they made something up for a creation myth yet it never changed for the Genesis version or as you'll see other cultures with striking similarities procession is the only key to understanding all this when we look at the king list of bosis Circa 747 BC we find something remarkable brosis the heniz Babylonian philosopher astrologer proposes in his Babylonia in the first section of book two a second list of anti- deluvian Kings who reigned after the appearance of oanes the Fishman deity this time including 10 sovereigns four cities and 120 periods of rain the two following sections of his book two are devoted to a description of the flood and to the post deluvian Kings brosus followed his narrative from The Archives of Babylonia boura and these archives regarding the creation and the first ages of the world copied Revelations aesthetic L inscribed on Tablets by oanes the first EPO Fishman and the inventor of letters sciences and arts the founder of laws cities and all [Music] [Music] civilization in the Babylonian brose's story there were 10 Kings who lived very long lives from creation to the time of the FL blood this is given as a total of 432,000 years again 432 sosus is one complete procession cycle at this point alarm Bells should be going off because the number 432 is perhaps best known in relation to Hindu ideas of cycles of time the kuga is said to last 432,000 years being part of the Great cycle which itself lasts 4,320 ,000 [Music] years the cross-cultural links between ancient mythology cycles of time and astronomy doesn't stop here the Viking Edis that were found in Iceland tell the story of the day of Ragnarok the Doomsday of the Gods at that time 800 Divine Warriors will come out of each of the 540 doors of Valhalla 800 * 540 equal 432,000 when you look at the king list with astronomy in mind you seem to get satisfactory insights into not just Samaran culture but other cultures and their mythologies astronomy myth and Celestial mathematics are undoubtedly interwoven the king list is by no means solved but no other satisfactory explanation has ever been given before for the duration of the lengthy Reigns in [Music] question this is not an abstract reasoning either samarians writes up to the time of the Greco Roman Empire attributed Heavenly Bodies as gods or vice versa the God's names being attributed to Heavenly Bodies whichever way you prefer it said Julius Caesar when he marched into conquer Rome painted his face in red in honor of Mars the God of War it seems plausible that scientific knowledge could have embedded itself in myth and crystallized itself in the form of numbers astronomical fact encoded by means of simple arithmetic yet apparently complex enough to have escaped notice thus repeat repated in the analysis of rationalistic thought therefore revealing itself through myth the Ancients reasoned differently and regarded it in esteem to the pertinence and extension of knowledge quote empirical fact unquote needed myth to magnify it and numbers to reveal it when you grasp that you'll grasp the Heritage of all the astronomy based ancient cultures all of society benefited from that approach and knowledge in those societies was never something hidden it was accessible to the intelligence of those who possess such gifts the myths and monuments that crystallized such knowledge was available to all people it's rather modern society with its incapacity really to understand otherness as well as its bondage to its own ego that masks this lack of availability through a panel of experts Who Remain useless and deaf to dialogue it's become a body of knowledge reserved for Specialists and shut away in inaccessible places reduced to an absurd complexity of data and [Music] results now that we've battled through the Samaran King list seeing the tug of war between mythology and history seeing how the creation myth may actually make sense when using the right data you might think Case Closed astronomy is the element we need astronomy and procession May Be The Missing element but separating mythology from history is incredibly difficult astronomy only gives us another lens into our past to see clearer the Samaran King list was not just an ancient manuscript originally recorded in the Samaran language listing Kings of Samaria from ancient Southern Iraq and neighboring dynasties detailed supposed rain lengths and the locations of official kingship kingship was believed to have been handed down by the gods and could be transferred from one city to another reflecting perceived hegemony in the [Music] region throughout its Bronze Age existence the document evolved into a political tool its final and single attested version dating to the middle Bronze Age aimed to legitimize E's claim to hegemony when e who was vying for dominance with Larsa and other neighboring city states in southern Mesopotamia the king list Blends prehistorical presumably mythical pre-dynastic rulers with implausibly lengthy reigns with later more plausibly historical dynasties although the Primal kings are historically unattested this does not preclude their possible correspondence with historical rulers who were later mythicized some mainstream ass serologists view the pre-dynastic Kings as a later fictional addition only one ruler listed is known to be female kouba the female Tavern keeper who alone accounts for the third d of [Music] [Music] Kish the earliest listed ruler whose historicity has been archaeologically verified is nme barage C of Kish Circa 2600 BC reference to this individual in the Epic of of Gilgamesh has led to speculation that Gilgamesh himself may be historical in fact reports by the BBC came out in the second Iraq war that they found the chb of the demigod gilgames a German lead expedition has discovered what is thought to be the entire city of Uruk in including where the Euphrates once flowed last resting place of its Fame demigod King Gilgamesh the grave of King Gilgamesh looks incredibly similar to that which is described in the Epic of [Music] Gilgamesh one has to know it's it's the scene of action of the oldest epic of man kind so it was a place where uh the the development of the writing has taken place so it was a huge City Center in in Ancient M Mesopotamia which enables such a such big developments in in uh in the in the history of man it was described in the Epic that the burial was of gamish was inside the river the ancient river of oatis and we found in just outside of the city an area very near of an so-called New Year's temple in the middle of the former erratus River we detected the remains of suchan building this building is the grave of King gilgames as it was described by the Epic of gilgames definitely it must be the grave of King gigamesh looks very very similar to that what is [Music] described in this 2003 news report by the BBC you can see that archaeologists whilst in Iraq believe they may have found the Lost Tomb of King gilgames the subject of the oldest book in history King gilgames was believed to be 2/3 God 1/3 human the Epic of Gilgamesh written by Middle Eastern Scholars some 2500 years before the birth of Christ commemorated the life of the ruler of the city of irach from which Iraq gets its name now this German Le Expedition has claimed discovery of the city of irac the resting place of its famous King and his grave in the Gilgamesh Epic a set of inscribed clay tablets Gilgamesh was described as having been buried under the Euphrates river in a tomb apparently constructed where the Waters of the ancient river parted following his [Music] death they found just out inside the city an area in the middle of the former Euphrates River the remains of such a building which can only be interpreted as his burial this should be the story of the century after all the Epic of Gilgamesh is the oldest story in the world fast binder stated that the amazing discovery of the ancient city under the Iraqi desert had been made possible by modern magnetogram technology what he neglects to mention is this new high-tech geophysical method was only developed just before the Invasion the archaeology was not sanctioned by anyone and as soon as the remains of demigod King gilgames was exhumed the Germans and Americans squabbled over possession the invasion of Iraq almost ended immediately after the archaeological find as the date of the BBC report [Music] shows the biggest find of the century has been suppressed to this day it would be out of this world to test the DNA of a Sumerian king or an intact Sumerian skeleton in general sadly the oldest skeleton ever found in Mesopotamia the uid skeleton at the Penn museum is not marked for DNA testing three dynasties are notably excluded from the list the Larsa Dynasty which VI for power with the I Dynasty during the I Larsa period and the two dynasties of Legos which respectively preceded and ensued the Acadian Empire when Lagos exercised considerable influence in the region Lagos is known directly from the archaeological artifacts dating from Circa 2500 BC C the list is important to the chronology of the third millennium [Music] BC However the fact that many of the dynasties listed range simultaneously from varying localities makes it difficult to reproduce a strict linear chronology the combination of astronomical data mythology and the mix of actual Kings God Kings and rulers become rather convoluted at this point the later Babylonian and Assyrian King list preserved the earliest portions of the list well into the 3rd Century BC when the bosis Babylonia popularized fragments of the list in the helenic world in 1960 the epcal list or ack list of kings and S Ages was discovered by German archaeologists at the Ancient Temple at Iraq The List dating to Circa 165 BC contains a series of Kings equivalent to the Samarian anti delians called [Music] apalo the epcal were the embodiment of this culture so much so that historians wrestling with the literature of these sages become so embroiled in mythology that they become mythologists in a way themselves the tale of adapa one of the first Mesopotamia sages really begs explanation because like the Epic of gilgames there's a theme or a question of immortality within the body of writings this is the fuel that drives the historians to seek answers to the lengthy Reigns of the god Kings of Mesopotamia In fairness whilst they were in astronomy culture and the fact they used processional numbers does explain the purely numerical values in the king's list [Music] somewhat the Quest for immortality in the Epic of Gilgamesh and the test of immortality in the tale of adapa is a complete mystery it is as if the samarians developed the most amazing script writing skills as a backdrop to the god Kings of Mesopotamia you might think this is all very creative of the samarians they were dreaming up wild science fiction stories whereby they love to blur the line between fact and fiction how ever an almost identical scenario is going on in Egypt at about the same time in Egyptian mythology there was the agad a Greek root word meaning the eight-fold they were eight primordial deities worshiped in hermopolis during the Old Kingdom Period 27th to the 22nd century BC [Music] well there's no doubt as to the Antiquity of this group of gods such that even at the time of composition of the pyramid texts towards the end of the Old Kingdom Period they were Antiquated and forgotten by everyone except religious experts the oldest known pictorial representations of the group do not predate the time of SEI the first Wallace budge compares the concept to a group of four pairs of primeval gods mentioned in the Babylonian creation myth the anuma Alish text of the late period described them as having the heads of frogs male and serpents female and they're often depicted in this way in reliefs of the talic period budge also argues that the aguad is the original company of gods or pout [Music] neru [Music] the links between eight primordial beings and serpent-like deities being a part of both apparently independent creation myths Beggars believe before we explore the Babylonian creation myth further it must be noted that Egypt also possesses the exact same problems with King's lists the mysterious shemsu were were semi- divine Kings and keepers of sacred knowledge in pre-dynastic Egypt according to an ancient and very unique Papyrus known as the Turin Kings list or the Turin Royal Cannon 10 neru or Gods reigned for hundreds of years each for a total of 23,200 [Music] years [Music] after this comes a list dedicated to the shemsu the followers of Horus who reigned a total of 13,400 years the Shemu hor were activist priests and keepers of sacred astronomical knowledge they observed celestial objects and were familiar with the movements of the Sun moon stars and other planets the shemsu wh were familiar with the procession the great year of 25,920 years at hopis the followers of Horus kept the knowledge of the ancient Egyptian astronomical religion alive for thousands of years the anuma Alish is the Babylonian creation myth named after its opening words it was recovered by Austin Henry layard in 1849 in fragmentary form in the ruin library of Asher Bap pal at Nineveh modern day mosul irq and published by George Smith in 1876 the anuma Alish has about a th000 lines and is recorded in Old Babylonian on seven clay tablets each holding between 115 and 170 lines of Samarian Acadian uniform script most of tablet 5 has never been recovered but aside from this the text is almost complete the Epic is one of the most important sources of understanding the Babylonian worldview centered on the supremacy of Marduk and the creation of humankind for the service of the Gods its primary original purpose however is not an exposition of theology or theogony but the elevation of Marduk the chief God of Babylon among other Mesopotamian [Music] gods [Music] the version from the library of Asher bopal dates to the 7th Century BC the composition of the text probably dates to the Bronze Age to the time of hamurabi or perhaps the early cite era roughly 18th to the 16th centuries BC although some Scholars favor a later date of Circa 1100 BC the epic names two primeval Gods abzu who represents fresh water and Tiamat representing Oceanic Waters several other gods are created aah and his brothers who reside in Tiamat v body they make so much noise that the babble or noise annoys Tiamat and absu great absu wishes to kill the young Gods but Tiamat [Music] disagrees the Vier Mamu agrees with apsu's plan to destroy them Tiamat to stop this from occurring warns AA the most powerful of the Gods AI uses magic to put absu into a coma then kills him and shuts Mumu out aah then becomes the chief God marries Domina and has a son Marduk greater still than aah himself Marduk is given wind to play with and he uses the wind to make dust storms and tornadoes this disrupts tiamat's great body and causes the gods still residing inside her to be unable to [Music] sleep [Music] the gods persuade teamat to take revenge for the death of her husband absu her power grows and some of the Gods join her she creates 11

violent storms kululu Fishman and kusaru Bowman to help her win the battle and elevates kingu her new husband to Supreme Dominion a lengthy description of the other gods inability to deal with the threat follows Marduk offers to save the gods if he's appointed as their leader and allowed to remain so even after the threat passes when the gods agree to muk's conditions he's selected as their Champion against Tiamat and becomes very powerful Marduk challenges Tiamat to combat and destroys her he then rips her corpse into two halves with which he fashion the earth and the sky Marduk then creates the calendar organizes the planets and stars and regulates the moon the sun and the weather the gods who have pledge their allegiance to Tiamat are initially forced into labor in the service of the Gods who sided with Marduk but they're freed from these labors when Marduk then destroys tiamat's husband kingu and uses his blood to create humankind to do the work for the gods most noteworthy is Marx's symbolic elevation over enil who was seen by earlier Mesopotamian civilizations as the king of the Gods as previously pointed out in the king list it looks like this detailed creation myth has astronomical framework in mind the use of numbers Heavenly Bodies planets Stars Sun and Moon are undeniable the use of of the terminology serpent snake and fish man is of ultimate significance when we turn our attention to the dogen tribe of Mali western Africa this becomes [Music] apparent Mali is a small landlock country situated in the West African region of the continent and HED to the legendary Dogan people the Doan tribe occupies a region in Mali south of the Sahara Desert currently having an estimated 100,000 members the first Western scientists to visit and study the Dogan people were French anthropologists Marcel grial and Germaine deerin who initially contacted them in 1931 they documented the traditional mythology and sacred beliefs of the Dogan which included an extraordinary body of ancient regarding Sirius the brilliant far distant dog star let us now discuss the astounding links to the Doan creation mythology the Doan creation myth is a bit complex and quite controversial having different versions however it's generally believed that heaven which is regarded as the creat Creator is called Amma also called amen at the beginning of time Amma a supreme god who lived in the celestial regions and was the origin of all creation created the Earth and immediately joined with it Amma then decided to create a representative of order called the Nomo and created for him eight assistants comprising of four couples of twins these eight deities were called the ancestors of human beings and they too descended to Earth in an ark also created by Amma the ark was suspended from Heaven by a copper chain which allowed the ark to float down to earth like the sun traverses the sky and settles in the [Music] west just like the Babylonian and Egyptian we see the eight primor IAL beings represented and specifically four couples the use of astronomy embedded within their creation myth the star Serius and the pleades feature Heavenly in Dogan creation mythology and they too feature heavily in Egyptian and Babylonian culture the list of comparisons doesn't stop there the numo Creator gods were described by Doon priest Ogo toell they have casks and slanted eyes as well as cow's noses they also have fishtails serpent-like bodies and strange bumps on their shoulder joints the descriptions are completely identical to the ubed serpent goddess statues found in the city of or located in southern Iraq they date from the ubed period around 4500 BCE these statues have lines across their fish and serpent-like bellies that were described by Ogo chimelli as being in a series of V's without points [Music] the fact these statues identically resemble the numo primordial beings as described by Ogo tamell indicates these serpent goddess figures found in World mythology have evolved from the images and stories about the numo they're often described as semi-aquatic beings with fish-like skin like mer or mermaids this we also see represented as oanes the fish man of Babylon oanes and the older Semitic God Dagon were considered identical the Doan even practiced the Semitic ritual of [Music] circumcision the names of this deity might morph over time and culture but the specific traits and characteristics are always the same oanes just like the numo came to instruct the natives the secrets of Agriculture mound building and Metallurgy there's no definitive conclusion to draw our story is convoluted it's like someone gave a very unique creation myth to various cultures at or around the same time in our past and each one ran with it in their own way the only thing we can say safely about the king list of Samaria is that they will lead you down a metaphorically profound Rabbit Hole this week the documentary series kingdoms of Samaria goes to a whole new level in this episode we're emphasizing the advanced engineering of the grand architects of Mesopotamia we are breaking out New Perspectives and analogies and Research into previously unknown aspects of these mysterious cultures in [Music] Samaria we are back again exploring high tech rock crystal carvings and this time completely inexplicable Beyond mysterious having an atmosphere of perplexity that'll satisfy everyone's [Music] curiosity it's important to first state that it's nearly impossible to separate engineering and science from the art ritual and practices of the samarians you might think this is an unusual concept science is science art is Art ritual is ritual in the ancient world the samarians built temples for the gods they utilized every facet of their science and engineering to put Magic Ritual and worship into their buildings temples and palaces they also embedded their genius no how into many cultural practices there are secret societies that still today embody this hidden knowledge into their temples and way of life it's a practice that never went away ask the average person how engineering science and technology developed they would tell you each developed over extended periods of time becoming more advanced as the centuries passed each in their own [Music] way [Music] this may be true for recent centuries but the dawn of civilization doesn't just exist that term is repeatedly used to refer to Samaran and Egyptian cultures however these cultures were fully fledged right at what we call their Genesis we've seen in the episode The God Kings of Mesopotamia the ogdoad civilizers the mysterious group of eight primordial deities gave us our civilization and subsequent knowledge what Academia refers to as the dawn of civilization is more akin to the midday of civilization putting it kindly ask the average person about the samarians you'll either get nothing no idea of who they were or else a sanitized version of who they are courtesy of Academia due to their possession of the artifacts and knowledge if you're well informed you might get a legacy of what they left us it encompasses everything from the following lengthy list which is significant to recite as it's rarely done samarians and later Babylonians the world's first civilization gave us religious practice science engineering mathematics art architecture literature music societal structure government laws medicine living standards Commerce Metallurgy astronomy agriculture astrology the wheel The Chariot sailing the plow Warfare time measurement weights writing urbanization irrigation cartography printing libraries and calendars this extensive list is only a grouping of surian Firsts by subject matter each subject has its own list of specific achievements as we've seen in previous episodes of kingdom of Samaria regarding mathematics they achieved without doubt geometry trigonometry the Pythagoras theum Advanced calculus and abstract reasoning these samarians were gifted individuals who carved their knowledge onto the landscape of Mesopotamia one of the most hostile Aid regions on the planet they were Grand architects who possessed Advanced engineering skills given to them by their gods and they utilized them in honor of their gods one such Samaran architect left us amazed insights into the almost religious and ritual practice of engineering strange as it may sound guda ruler of Lagos didn't just build temples for his God he wrote the Mandate on how later temples would be built and the materials to be used entering the gadea room in the Lou Museum you're instantly filled with the quality of Art and sophistication of the [Music] samarians the diorite sculptures of ludea the ruler of Lagos are some 4,000 years old and some of them are life-size whilst some are standing positions and some are seated but one of the most remarkable is a seated figure that's missing his head part of its knee and one of its thumbs although somewhat in a state of decay he is exceptional because he holds on his lamp a tablet that has inscribed in it the plan of a temple guda was the prince or governor of Lagos a citystate in southern Mesopotamia this period is known as the third dynasty of or or the Neo summerian period some of this comes after the earlier period when the Sumerians had been in control of Southern mes known as the Sumerian dynastic period it was interrupted when the acadians a militaristic culture took control but the acadians were destabilized when they were attacked by a people from the mountains which allowed for the samarians to reassert themselves and that's the period we're looking at [Music] here guda built or rebuilt many temples clearly concerned about demonstrating his piety and we know that from inscriptions including the inscriptions on this sculpture you can see CI form on a skirt on the chair and all the way across his back the inscription tells us that it was important to gidea that this statue be erected of specifically diorite this incredibly hard stone is not available in the flood plane between the Tigris and Euphrates in m lamia Stone had to be imported and diorite being such a hard Stone to carve but one that's incredibly durable guda tells us in the inscription for this statue that nobody was to use silver or lapis lazuli neither should copper or tin or bronze be a working material it's exclusively of diorite he's comparing this to materials that are colorful that are shining clearly preferring this very dark stone before we analyze the diorite statues of Samaria let's take a journey to the sister culture of Egypt where we see the same Obsession of using this extremely difficult material this mysterious use of diorite attests to the artistic prowess of the art in the ancient [Music] [Music] world [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] diorite is composed mainly of feldspar and lesser amounts of quartz and other minerals it's an extremely hard rock making it difficult to carve and work with it's hardness however also allows it to be worked finely and take a high polish and to provide a durable finished work one comparatively frequent use of diorite was for inscription in the ancient world as it is easier to carve in relief than in three-dimensional statuary the Ancients chose diorite for longevity and that longevity came at a price of hard Toil and a non-negotiable mandate to only use this material we see guda has his hands clasped in all these statues his feet are together and there's a real sense of solitude and dignity as these sculptures were erected in temples these statues took the place of guda before the gods thus continually offering prayer guda is known for building a series of temples predominantly including a temple to niru in the city of garu niru who was a primary deity of the samarians the building of this Temple was apparently extremely important to guda and is perhaps one reason reason why he's presented with this Temple plan on his [Music] [Music] lap [Music] [Music] the temple plan shows the walls that would have surrounded the inner Shrine within the larger Temple complex walls with fortifications with towers with entrances and we can even make out small buildings on the outside of the walls in between the buttresses we see two other objects on his leg lamp there's a stylus which would have been used to inscribe the plan in question there's also a tool a little degraded in condition but we can still make out it's a tool for measurement remarkably the measurements on G's measurement stick has increments exactly relating to our inch etched in detail are regular graduations everything about this sculpture is designed to last for eternity remarkable that we think of in the USA as the Imperial inch is in fact G's inch these samarians were known to have a system of weights and measures the most common of these are duck stylized weights they could weigh and count accurately there's a huge deliberation over vessels they had as they relate to the cubic foot and thus the inch 12 in to a foot yet guda sits there with his ruler with increments of inches in the Lou diorite statues were also being produced in ancient Egypt at the same time as gadea just like the Egypt versions are always shown Barefoot there are other heads shown here in the gallery typically wearing a hat that may be made of wool or fur but it's very different from the kinds of crowns worn by the earlier Acadian rulers guda is shown clean shaven in contrast to the elaborate beard of the acadians there's a smaller sculpture here in the legashi exhibit made from a lighter color of diorite where the figure is much more intact and he's interestingly holding a jar for which water spouts in streams in two directions we even see Fish playing those streams and this is an indication of the bounty of good day is rain for his people and that's assured by his piety toward the Gods in all these sculptures the face is wide-eyed and the eyes are framed by these wonderful arcing eyebrows everything about this speaks to a kind of piety a kind of Simplicity a kind of reverence and artistic as all this is it was done in the most difficult Way by using the Exotic diorite as a mandate but why the simplest answer is because the gods told them to literally guda just like many rulers were taking orders from Gods to carry out actions academia's viewpoint on guda of Lagos is that he set about a building craze in honor of his God like it was an abstract concept the Lou portrays guda as commissioning the temple when Texs clearly State he did not portrayed as if it was all his idea and out of respect for his God he dedicates the temple to his God this is a blatant aberration disguised with the religious practice and mythology labels we can see the truth in the very same room in the Lou two huge cylinders explain in detail without interpretation the guda cylinders are a pair of terracotta cylinders dating to Circa 2125 BC on which is written in CI form a quote Sumerian myth unquote called the building of nirus Temple the cylinders were made by guda the ruler of Lagos and were found in 1877 during excavations at ancient gear to Iraq and are now displayed in the Lou in Paris they're the largest couni for cylinders ever discovered and contain the longest known text written in the Samaran language the text says and this is academia's own translation that Anil ordered ningu to build the temple and that ningu ordered Prince guda ruler of Lagos to implement the temple plan at no point Duda says this is his original idea that he's carrying this purely out of his own desire and that there is a dedication to an abstract deity this is the only interpretation and impression Academia gives us it's not that there's trickery going on Academia truly believes when they say the words god and goddess mentioned that mythology must be applied these two cylinders were not commissioned by King G of Lagos he was merely carrying out orders albeit by quote Gods unquote and he clearly states this on the cylinders they serve as a literary and historical record of the construction of the Temple of niru and the enthronement of the Divine king and queen of Lagos during the ceremony to Mark the new year here how is this related to Mesopotamian engineering every case you look at every building Temple and practice method and construction techniques and mandates are all related to interactions of humans and Divinity cylinder B even talks about after the temple was completed the God was invited to take possession of the finished product there needs to be a reclassification of what Divinity meant to the samarians not what it means to us Divinity to the samarians had a tangible element to it like it or [Music] not gaa's Reign was dominated by the Reconstruction of the Temple of ningu he had several commemorative inscriptions built into the temple in the foundations beneath the doors and in the walls the ritual practices of laying cornerstones and imbuing other sentiments into the foundations of temples is preserved in Freemasonry today when temples were rebuilt they sought out the corner brick embedded in the structure with Samaran handwritten stamped instructions or rituals the brick was broken and a new one made with the incantation on it various other methods of this existed elsewhere in the structures they were built whether it was walls temples or ziggurats stone or metal tablets copper figurines ending in a point like nails and Clay cones and Nails whose head was designed to stick out of the wall the clay cones or nails were literally pushed into the mud brick walls as a ritual guda was a master of all these rituals and incantations in that respect he was a grand architect of ancient [Music] gearu why all the ritual practices if you're starting off your civilization trying to get good old fashion engineering off the ground why start all this extracurricular practice wouldn't you find it complex enough getting all the math and science right for the zigarette step pyramids wouldn't you find it difficult enough kickstarting a civilization in Mesopotamia without Stone having to literally invent everything from bricks to methodology the answer is always the same same the gods told them how to do this yet Academia looks back at this Epoch conjures up its own idea of what a God or Divinity is doesn't like it can't explain it resorts to calling it mythology and then denies the complexity of it all in addition they call it the dawn of civilization and everything tells us it was long after the dawn now that you've seen the convoluted early accounts of our first engineering thanks to gadea when we we look to the ancient site of Babylon that so many of us have heard of from the Bible we've heard the story of the Tower of Babel which may have come from a zigurat in ancient Babylon Babylon conjures up these great images of the ancient world and many achievements and famous people but it's a very humble looking site today before we break down the history of engineering at one of the most famous cities in the ancient world of Babylon let's take a look a quick visit to see the condition as it is today and the difficulties in preserving the Legacy in a [Music] millennia Babylon 4,000 years of Mesopotamia Rich cultural heritage ancient city of King Nebuchadnezzar capital of one of the earliest cradles of civilization and birthplace of writing and literature today following years of neglect and conflict Babylon hardly evokes the same image of Splendor visitors enter through a replica of the famous ishar gate the original was carried off in the early 20th century by European archaeologists and is now on display in Berlin so what are we seeing right there that looks old this uh this old this is the inner walls that's original original Iraqi archaeologist Hadi Musa shows us an area some believe is the site of the mythical Hanging Gardens one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World Babylon today not only offers lessons of civilization's past but also tidbits of insight into its more recent turbulent history we meet Hussein sahb one of the guards here he clearly remembers the first day in 2003 that American tanks lum into view and we told that this concertina wire left by the military is now supposed to prevent visitors from climbing all over the 2 and a half Millennia Old Lion of Babylon the symbol of Iraq excavations under the reign of Saddam Hussein left much to be desired a lot of what you see is a cheap brick replica of what Babylon should have looked like in 600 BC Saddam Hussein had bricks put into the walls like this one here effectively it was his way of trying to immortalize himself they're they're thanking him the writing here is thanking him um and it's very much what Kings Millennia beforehand used to do when they were rebuilding this historic [Music] City [Music] Babylon conjures up these great images of the ancient world and many achievements and famous people people are often shocked that it's mud brick that it's simple Construction Technologies and except for the raised Brick animal figures that are very famous the rest of it doesn't look the way we expect we read about hamurabi and his building campaign and his code of laws and then later during the period that we call Neo Babylonia when Nebuchadnezzar rebuilt the walls and made luxurious palaces the most notorious king of Babylon Nebuchadnezzar the second embarked on one of the most extensive preservation and Engineering projects of ancient times the engineering techniques and materials that he used can be seen in the following artifact well this is a romantic object basically a socking great lump of clay that was used to decorate a building in Babylon at the time of Nebuchadnezzar II and we know all that because the C formed text that you can see in this rectangular panel at the front has been squashed into the clay leaving that imprint and if you decipher that it tells the story the thick lump of clay if I turn it around it's got this black stuff on the outside and that is bitchman which was used to stick these clay tiles effectively onto the outside of Nebuchadnezzar's [Music] buildings Hammer Robbie's law code was carved into a huge 2 25 M or 7 1/2 ft Stone steel and consists of 282 laws the only reason the code of hamurabi is so well preserved from Babylonia 1734 BC is because it was carved on diorite some 500 years later after guda we see the difficult practice of carving diorite ensue it's one of the oldest deciphered writings of significant length in the world and proves gaa's plan for longevity works if you choose the right building materials laws if they are to permeate culture must last the ravages of time importing diorite a rare substance only found in a few locations on the planet was a [Music] necessity Babylon became a center for learning in the Arts and the sight of one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World the Hanging Gardens of Babylon made possible by Hydraulic Engineering on a vast scale samarians and their successors were from earliest records masters of irrigation building levies and manipulating the Mesopotamia rivers to their advantage an imperial capital Fame for the Ishtar gate which is in the pergamon museum in Berlin a lot remains on the site even though mud brick is a very humble material the monumentality of the site is in the Epic scale so you look at these walls and they're meters and meters thick meters and meters high the ancient Sumerians took the only commodity they had invented the simple mud brick and scaled it up on a scale that was simply astonishing there were two sizes of brick an industrial size and a more decorative style Babylon became an epicenter for Science and Engineering it became so powerful they just imported whatever they didn't have from thousands of miles the Judea cylinder B even tells us in his time the list of products they were importing from a 2,000 km radius from as far as malua the Indus Valley civilizations by Nebuchadnezzar's time Babylon was the engineering Trade Center of the world the Babylonian Ishtar gate in the pergamon museum Berlin is one of the most astonishing relics of the ancient world originally there were eight Double Gates that formed part of the walls around the ancient city of Babylon it doesn't just impress us it also impressed people when it was built Nebuchadnezzar of biblical fame ascended to the throne and proceeded to rebuild the already ancient city of Babylon this is a city that has its roots in the 3D millennium BC but it become a major political Center under King hamurabi in the 1700s BC the city had remained populated but regained importance in the 6th Century under Nebuchadnezzar II and under his father what we're seeing here is an enormous preservation campaign that Nebuchadnezzar II had undertaken engineering didn't develop it was preserved from from Kingdom to Kingdom over very long epochs we might recognize Nebuchadnezzar II from the Bible from the Book of Daniel he's the ruler of Babylon who conquers and destroys the temple in Jerusalem and who's responsible for the Exile of the Jews clearly he was very powerful he was able to undertake this enormous restoration and expansion campaign he fortified and strengthened 11 miles of wall around the city of Babylon he reconstructed the great zigurat in Babylon which had the Temple of Marduk at its top Nebuchadnezzar II had a Grand Vision he took a decaying City Babylon and transformed it into a vast sophisticated Metropolis Nebuchadnezzar understood his place in history and he wrote inscriptions in his new buildings that not only identified them and identified their purpose and him as their Patron but also asked future rulers to rebuild them for him it's as though he knew that Empires come and go and that he could speak across history to Future Engineers why he wanted Babylon to reflect his own magnificence The Architects of the time adorned the facades of the buildings with painted glazed bricks so that the massive constructions lining the wide procession Street the Ishtar gate itself and the Palace of Nebuchadnezzar would Dazzle visitors to his Capital Nebuchadnezzar essentially took on the role of the grand Architects before him perhaps lamenting of the time of guda it's why he left us the tantalizing inscriptions in an attempt to preserve the engineer ing which has a mix of divine and human influence nowadays Freemasonry preserves such practices of temple building in their society's [Music] rituals ziggurats are perhaps the first known engineering structures involving mathematics geomet and human and divine intent essentially they're stepped Temple towers built and utilized as religious structures with some 25 zigat known zigat are found in the major cities of what was Mesopotamia encompassing now modern Iran spread throughout the ancient lands of Sumeria Babylonia and Assyria they were built from a variety of epochs ranging 2200 to 500 BC the fame Tower of Babel is associated with the zigurat of the Great temple of Marduk in Babylon these ziggurats were simulated mountains and many people in the ancient near East continued to Worship in high [Music] places [Music] the great zigurat of ER is perhaps the most famous example built with two or three Terraces faced with Kil baked bricks their colossal facades paneled and recessed these huge structures dominated the Mesopotamian scene ER itself in the great cities of IDU Kish UK neur and later during the cite period all had zigurat the ruins of some of them standing to this day why build upwards it's possible that the zigurat was intended as a Stairway to Heaven and that the worshippers believed the gods descended from Heaven to this halfway house meeting place according to Herodotus at the top of each zigurat was a shrine although none of these shrines have survived one PR iCal function of the zigurat was a high place on which the priests could Escape Rising water that annually inundated lowlands and occasionally flooded for hundreds of kilometers another practical function of the zigat was for security since the shrine was accessible only by way of the three staircases a small number of guards could prevent non priests from spying on the secret rituals at The Shrine on top of the zigron such as initiation rituals particularly The Agrarian ritual known as the ucini Mysteries since the Mysteries involved visions and Conjuring of an afterlife some scholars believe that the power of longevity of the eluan Mysteries a consistent set of Rights ceremonies and experiences that span two Millennia came from psychoactive plants each zigurat was part of a temple complex that included a courtyard storage rooms bathrooms and living quarters around which a city was built figuratively speaking the zigat was engineered as the Heart of the City and primarily used as the mystery school for the grand architects who dwell in them everything we see the ancient Sumerians engineer there are always intentions of honoring the gods and goddesses this is perhaps most apparent in the high-tech engineering of Mesopotamian cylinder seals before we do any analysis on the ancient cylinder seals the most precious sophisticated objects that come out of the ancient Samaria lands let's take a look for a moment at a computer animation of an individual seal in 3D how it functions and how it looks under [Music] magnification [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] now that we've seen how the ancient cylinder seal it looks effectively functions as a printing press let's take a moment to hear on an expert's opinion of the rarest and most beautiful seals ever discovered if you look carefully the cylinder of stone is engraved with a dense series of hieroglyphics and pictures because 3,500 years ago you wouldn't be expected to read it off the stone what you would have handy would be a tablet of moist clay and you'd apply the cylinder to the moist clay like this now we have something that you can physically read and there's an engraving of a character that is a god with one or two locusts above him he's Seated on a stool and is holding a trident who is this God well a bit more research might reveal that what the experts can decipher is that it is a seal from the period of the king kuring galzu approximately 3,500 years ago and what it does is to give the mark of authority to the person who is bearing this seal for whatever orders the King has issued Mesopotamian cylinder seals are another accessory War by wealthy individuals invented around 3500 BC the so-called dawn of civilization made from every type of stone imaginable these cylinders were drilled lengthwise like cylindrical beads and carved with imagery and or a signature unique to their owner cylinder seals were worn on a string or pin perhaps as a status symbol like a pendant they had functionality too rolled across wet clay as a signature the clay could be baked and utilized as a form of receipt the owner or ruler could literally give his seal of approval some of the best art we have of Mesopotamia is encoded on these cylinder seals the surface of the cylinder was carved into the stone with a design so that when rolled onto clay the cylinder would leave a continuous impression of the design reversed and in relief cylinder seals were invented around 3500 BC in southern Mesopotamia now Iraq or Southwestern Iran and were used as an administrative tool as jewelry and as magical amulets until as late as 300 BC cylinder seals were linked to the invention of uniform writing on clay and when this spread to other areas of the near East the use of cylinder seals spread too the shape and size of cylinder seals the type of gemstone material used and the designs carved into the surface varied according to period and region many ancient clay seal Impressions have survived on tablets envelopes and ceilings small pieces of clay applied to doors and containers including jars baskets sacks leather bags and wooden boxes however these are often incomplete the designs on the many thousands of surviving cylinder seals are best studied from Modern impressions of Rollings of the seals on clay or some other soft material why are cylinder seals so Hightech the intricate carving on these ancient cylinder seals is so difficult to see with the naked eye often you cannot see the imagery until it's pressed into clay added to this the imagery that is carved into the objects is a negative so that when it's rolled into clay it becomes positive not high-tech enough yet the imagery starts on the cylinder is carved around the cylinder and finishes exactly where it started the Carver cannot see the imagery as he's halfway around to the other side during the process in addition the detail of the imagery is done to a depth of millimet in those minute Impressions the artist can bring out detail that's so artistically Advanced like the calave muscles in a leg as it's in motion feathers Wings costumes Etc yet the most Hightech achievement of all is that they carve these cylinder seals out of insanely hard difficult materials chelidon rock crystal diorites extremely hard on the Mohs scale if you carve these seals on soft materials it would still be difficult just like Judea of Lagos had a mandate of what material to use for his statue there was a mandate of what material to use for each specific individual pink chelidon shown here was known as the goddess Stone lapis was a favorite for its blue red Carnelian rainbow chelidon white chelidon amst just about every color you can imagine it was like they didn't care how hard the material was or how difficult it was to carve it was all done in honor of the Gods art historians are particularly interested in cylinder seals for at least two reasons first it's believed that the images carved on seals accurately reflect the pervading Artistic Styles of the day and the region of their use in other words each seal is a small Time Capsule of what sorts of motifs and styles were popular during the lifetime of the owner the these seals which survive in substantial numbers offer valuable information to understand the developing Artistic Styles of the ancient near East the second reason why art historians are interested in cylinder seals is because of the iconography the study of the content of a work of art each character gesture and decorative element can be read and reflected on the owner of the seal revealing his or her social Rank and even sometimes the name of the owner although the same iconography found on seals can be found on carved stelli terracotta plaques wall reliefs and paintings its most complete compendium exists on the thousands of seals which have survived from Antiquity they are the true engineering Treasures of Mesopotamia and one of the biggest mysteries how they achieved such detail in the hardest known materials in this documentary series kingdoms of Sumeria we have endeavored to bring you the most interesting mysterious and out of this world artifacts this week's episode is packed with ancient rock crystal carvings lost technology ancient chemistry and we're still in pursuit of the legacy of the Sumerians focusing primarily this episode on the science and technology that they left us [Music] the civilizations of ancient Mesopotamia brought many important advances in the areas of Science and Technology both through invention and inherited knowledge it would be almost impossible to get through a complete list so we can only tackle the most significant the most mysterious and the most ingenious developments perhaps the most important obvious Advance made by the Mesopotamians was the invention of writing by the samarians with the invention of writing came the first recorded laws called hamurabi codee as well as the first major piece of literature called The Epic tale of Gilgamesh which we addressed in our episode The God Kings of Mesopotamia it might seem obvious to state but there would be no scientific Endeavors without a way to write down the complexity of data one huge body of data that features heavily in Samaria is [Music] mathematics the Mesopotamians used a number system with the base 60 just like we use base 10 they divided time up by 60s including a 60-second minute and a 60 Minute hour which we still use today they also divided up the circle into 360\u00b0 they had a wide knowledge of mathematics including addition subtraction multiplication division quadratic and cubic equations incredibly also ratio is fractions trigonometry and calculus [Music] this was not just keeping track of Records this was to advance large building projects the Mesopotamians had formulas for figuring out the circumference and area for different geometric shapes like rectangles circles and triangles some evidence suggests that they even knew the Pythagorean theorem long before Pythagoras wrote it down they made may have even discovered the number for pi INF figuring the circumference of a circle one of the most mysterious and enigmatic Samaran clay tablets nicknam Plimpton 322 is finally giving up its Secrets the analysis of this palm-size tablet by genius mathematician Daniel Mansfield of the University of New South Wales shows not just more advancement but that it was also much more simpler too if you open any history book on mathematics it will tell you that the ancient Greeks discovered trigonometry our Research into this Babylonian tablet is going to change all of that Clon 322 is a 3,700 year old fragment of clay from the old Babylonian period and it's a scientific Marvel of the ancient world we've known for decades that its unusual sequence of numbers proves that the Babylonians knew the Pythagorean theorem a thousand years before Pythagoras was born but while there is agreement on what the tablet contains there's been no agreement on what it was used for our research shows that it's a trigonometric table so unfamiliar and advanced that in some respects it's Superior even to Modern trigonometry we've discovered that these lines represent the ratios for a series of right angle triangles ranging from almost a square to almost a flat line Babylonian unique approach to arithmetic and geometry means that this is not only the world's oldest trigonometric table it is also the only completely accurate trigonometric table on record [Music] the point is their legacy of Sumerian science could not exist without using their advanced math the Mesopotamian astronomers were able to follow the movements of the stars planets and the moon one major achievement was the ability to predict the movements of several [Music] planets this took logic mathematics and an advanced scientific process by studying the phases of the moon the Mesopotamians created the first calendar it had 12 lunar months and was the predecessor for both the Jewish and Greek [Music] calendars the Babylonians made several advances in medicine they used logic and recorded medical history to be able to diagnose and treat illnesses with various creams ointments and pills the caducus symbol known around the world today as a medical symbol is a remnant of this era of Sumerian medicine as the Sumerians seen medicine as a way of prolonging life the Quest for immortality is embedded in Samarian mythology medicine was seen as a prac practical step toward it the libation vase of guda with the dragon of Mushu dedicated to ningishzida 21st century BC short chronology the caducus is interpreted as depicting the God himself in Samarian mythology he appears in adapa myth as one of the two guardians of anu's celestial palis alongside dezi he was sometimes depicted as a serpent with a human head this amazing iconic symbol of the caducus is the traditional symbol of Hermes and features two snakes winding around an often winged [Music] staff it's often used as a symbol of medicine instead of the rod of aus especially in the United [Music] States the two snake caducus design has ancient and consistent associations with trade eloquence negotiation Alchemy and [Music] wisdom guda of ladash had a Temple dedicated to ningishzida and UDA princely ruler of Lagos in the 21st century BC short chronology was one of his [Music] devotees in the Lou there's a famous green statite vase carved for king guda of Lagos dedicated by its inscription to the god ninga his God guda ruler of Lagos for the prolongation of his life has dedicated did [Music] this the Mesopotamians made many technological advances they were the first to use the potter's wheel to make better Pottery they used irrigation to get water to their crops they used bronze metal and later iron metal to make strong tools and weapons and use looms to weave cloth from wool they utilize their science efficiently essentially creating a technological industry for enhanced living the walls of Babylon were once considered one of the Seven Ancient Wonders of the World there were two massive walls that surrounded the entire city archaeologists estimate that the walls were over 50 Mi long with each wall being around 23 ft wide and 35 ft tall there were also massive Towers at intervals along the wall that may have been hundreds of feet tall the Mesopotamians may have invented the simple machine called the Archimedes screw this would have helped to raise water to the heights needed for the plants in the famous Hanging Gardens of [Music] Babylon after the Assyrians conquered Babylon they developed glassw work as well as glazes for pottery and art to help it last longer we see the Assyrians immortalize the legacy of Sumerian science that was handed down through the Babylonian Empire 18 different canals have been found that brought water to the Assyrian Empire capital of Nineveh whilst the kingdoms may have changed in Samaria Sam Ian to Acadian then to Babylonian followed by Assyrian then finally by the Persians Bloodlines Kings and dynasties may have been in turmoil but the technology science and engineering always grew morphed or became preserved in one form or [Music] another which brings us to an insanely interesting artifact found in the Assyrian Empire capital of Nineveh now before we discuss the nimrud lens one of the most bizarre high-tech artifacts to come out of the ancient world let's just take a moment to reflect on where it came from as due to recent events the place does not exist anymore the destruction of the city of nimrod was in the following news clip which may be distressing for some viewers so please be advised this was one of the most magnificent archaeological sites in the world was here that an Assyrian King 3,000 years ago built his Palace and many of the statues and the frescos from that time were preserved of the highest quality but all of it destroyed in an act of Wen barbarity the likes of which has rarely been seen in our time or in any other time for that matter destruction of idolatrous images filming themselves smashing some of the finest artwork left to us from Antiquity everywhere here wreckage of prized artist of the ancient capital of the Assyrian Empire a place mentioned in the [Applause] [Music] [Music] Bible [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] now [Music] [Music] all [Music] the Nimrod lens ninva lens or layered lens whatever its origin as ornament as magnifying lens or part of a telescope the Nimrod lens is the oldest lens in the world looking at it evokes mystery and wonder it can be seen in room 55 of the British museum in case 9 of the lower Mesopotamian Gallery one possibility is that it could have been an heirloom hence the elusive context of this mysterious [Music] artifact the layered ninova lens is said to be from the period 721 to 705 BC however this date is based on where it was found the Neva lens is a 3,000-year-old piece of rock crystal Unearthed in 1853 from the throne room of King Sargon II's Assyrian Palace in Nimrod in Nineveh [Music] Iraq lard discovered the lens which is considered the first used or found Plano convex lens there is huge debate whether the lens is ground or polished rock crystal is the last substance you would want to shape into a lens due to its hardness on the most scale for this reason academics state that this lens could have been only an ornamental it is long argued it was part of a telescope or magnifying device because of the Babylonian Legacy of astronomy the most reasonable suggestion by far academics refute this as they say there's no context it might seem bizarre that Academia ignores artifacts that exist that they can touch examine and test because they don't like that there's nothing to go with it that is unfortunately how it works sometimes is it a Babylonian heirloom is it a legacy of Babylonian astronomy the extensive line of astronomical records on clay tablets stored in the British museum dating back to 747 BC indicate they observed some of the moons of Jupiter and Saturn quoting the English assyriologist George rollinson there said to be distinctive evidence that they observed the four satellites of Jupiter and strong reason to believe that they were acquainted likewise with the seven satellites of Saturn a Camden professor of ancient history he maintains it has generally been assumed that they were wholly ignorant of the telescope but if the satellites of s are really mentioned as it is thought that they are upon some of the tablets it will follow strange as it may seem to us that the Babylonians probably possessed Optical instruments of the nature of telescopes since it's impossible even in the clear vaporless sky of ancient Babylonia to discern the faint moons of that distant planet without lenses simply speaking there's huge context for this artifact and it's largely ignored [Music] as you'll see in the next episode working rock crystal to intricate designs primarily in cylinder seals was born out of an ancient high-tech School of Engineering it's not a question of whether this artifact exists it's not even a question of what it was used for it is in fact a lens it's a question of context do we give the Ancients in 700 BC the use of lens as a telescope that's essentially the bottom line which Academia struggles with another perfect example of this is the 2,000-year-old parthan battery most likely an heirloom from a previous culture again huge controversy and debate surrounds this artifact the constant Enigma is brought into play in the same style whilst ignoring the fact that a 2 year old sophisticated chemistry kit exists the parthians largely adopted the art architecture religious beliefs of previous cultures just like the Assyrians the parthan rulers were titled the King of Kings as a claimed to be The Heirs of the Persian Eid Empire indeed they accepted many local Kings as vassals where eids would have had centrally appointed the parthian battery was discovered in 1936 while Excavating ruins of a 2,000-year-old village near Bagdad workers discovered a mysterious small vase a 6-in high pot of bright yellow clay dating back to Millennia contained a cylinder of sheet copper 5 in by 1 1/2 in the edge of the copper cylinder was soldered with a 6040 lead tin alloy comparable to today's solder the bottom of the cylinder was camped with a crimped in Copper disc and sealed with bitchin or asphalt another insulating layer of asphalt sealed the top and held in place an iron Rod suspended into the center of the copper cylinder the rod showed evidence of having been corroded with an acidic [Music] agent these battery came to wider attention in 1938 when Wilhelm kig the German director of the national museum of Iraq found the object in the Museum's collections in 1940 kig published a paper speculating that they may have been galvanic cells perhaps used for electroplating gold onto Silver objects a reasonable assumption the battery whatever its use shows sophisticated chemistry and its construction shows Advanced use of materials metals and compounds in applied science until now the majority have concentrated on either dispelling it or attributing what the battery powered the most common example is the dendera lamp's theory few if any have concentrated on what it all means it implies knowledge of chemistry metery applied science and a technological industry however fundamental at the very least the ancient battery in the Baghdad Museum as well as those others which were Unearthed in Iraq are all ated from the parthian occupation between 248 BCE and 226 CE however Dr conic also found copper vases plated with silver in the Baghdad Museum excavated from surian sites in southern Iraq dating back to at least 2500 BCE when the vases were lightly taed a blue patina or film separated from the surface which is characteristic of silver Electro at ated onto copper base it would appear then that the parthians inherited their batteries from one of the earliest known civilizations in 1940 Willard FM gray an engineer at the General Electric high voltage laboratory in pitfield Massachusetts read of kik's theory using drawings and details supplied by German rocket scientist Willie lay gray made a replica of the battery using copper sulfate solution it gener generated about half a volt of electricity in the 1970s German egyptologist Arn egre built a replica of the Baghdad battery and filled it with freshly pressed grape juice as he speculated the Ancients might have done this generated 87 volts he used current from the battery to electroplate a silver statuette with gold this experiment proved that electric batteries were used some 18800 years before their modern invention by alesandro Volta in 1799 and even more astounding is the fact that they may have been utilized in electroplating it also seems that the use of similar batteries can be safely placed into ancient Egypt where several objects with traces of electroplated precious metals have been discovered at various locations electroplated objects were found in Egypt by the famous 19th century French archaeologist AUST marriette Excavating at the Sphinx of Giza Marriot Came Upon several artifacts at a depth of 60 ft in the great Universal dictionary of the 19th century he describes the artifacts as pieces of gold jewelry whose thinness and lightness make one believe they had been produced by electroplating an industrial technique that we've been using for only 2 or 3 years there are several anamalous finds in other regions which suggest use of chemical batteries on a grander scale electroplating seems the most probable use as there are tangible artifacts exhibiting this technology and both are chemical processes in fact the reverse chemical process of each other showing detailed knowledge of the anode and cathode concept so far Academia in a perplexing move has settled on the ancient batteries being used in magical rituals when we come to look at Mesopotamia Metallurgy it doesn't stand out on its own we know from objects found like the parthum batteries their ornaments and artistic jewelry they had a deep attraction to M Metals with various applications both artistic and technological sometimes amalgamating the two in electroplating [Music] artifacts the art of Metallurgy soon encompassed the ability to aloy Copper with other metals resulting in a cast hard but malleable metal we call bronze the Bronze Age our first metallurgical age was also a Mesopotamian contribution to Modern civilization much of ancient commerce was devoted to the metals trade it also formed the basis for the development in Mesopotamia of banking and the first money the silver Shrek Wade Ingot the many varieties of metals for which surian and Acadian names have been been found and the extensive technological terminology attest to The prominent level of Metallurgy in ancient Mesopotamia for a while this puzzled Scholars because Su as known was devoid of metal ores yet Metallurgy most definitely began there in fact the indis valley civilization may have been a Samaran Outpost for Mining and trading metal ORS there are so many similarities between these cultures brick building irrigation civil town planning known in lore as land of malua to the Sumerians the land of copper excavations uncovered the remains of Highly urbanized and modern Towns at paraa and mohenjo daro integrated as indis Valley Civilization 2800 to 2600 BC this era is generally praised for its seals jewelry and town planning also shows great progress in metallurgical techniques of bronze lead arsenic bronze and copper although main emphasis was on trade but The Artisans adopted several Exquisite techniques to manipulate different Alloys for usage in sculptures ornaments tools and creative motifs which are still being used in customized versions in various South Asian regions the extent of the indust valley trade is seen in the highly controversial hypa Israel tin ingots likely a Phoenician importation of an indis Valley Ingot clearly labeled in indis Valley script why did metalurgy originate in Samaria if they didn't have ore there the answer is energy smelting refining and alloying as well as casting could not be done without ample supplies of fuels to fire the Kiln crucibles and furnaces Mesopotamia may have lacked ores but it had the best fuels in abundance so the ores were brought to the fuels which explains many early inscriptions describing the bringing of metal ores from afar the fuels that made Suare technologically Supreme were bamen and asphalts petroleum products that naturally seeped up to the surface in many places it's been shown that the surface deposits of Mesopotamia were the ancient world's Prime source of fuels from the earliest times to the Roman era there is convincing evidence to show that the use of knowledge of the fuels and their properties were greater in Samaran times than in later civilizations the names of binus and petroleum materials in other languages Acadian Hebrew Egyptian CTIC greek latin and Sanskrit can clearly be traced to the Samarian Origins for example the most common word for petroleum Napa derives from napu stones that flare up the lineage of Samarian Metallurgy May have ancestry in the prehistoric Citadel of metsamor the ancient megalithic site and metal foundry is in the country of Armenia metsamor is a working excavation and Museum on the site of an ancient city complex with a large metallurgical and astronomical Center occupied Circa 7,000 BC to 17th century ad the site occupies a volcanic Hill and surrounding area The Citadel on top of the volcanic Hill is about 10 .5 hectares in size but the entire city is believed to have covered 200 hectares at its greatest extent housing up to 50,000 people excavations have shown strata of occupancy going back to the Neolithic period 7,000 to 5,000 BC but the most outstanding features of the site were constructed during the early middle and late bronze ages 5,000 to 2,000 BC inscriptions found within the excavation go as far back as the Neolithic period and a sophisticated pictograph form of writing was developed as early as 2 to 1800 BC the meore inscriptions have a likeness to later scripts the origins of the Eden story may very well originate in Eden it's often called the land of Noah and it is home to the ancient araru civilization who were closely associated with the kingdoms of Samaria the famous Samarian Rivers the time igis and Euphrates originate in the Armenian Highlands excavations began at metsamor in 1965 and are still in progress led by Professor Emma kanadian the most recent excavation work occurred in the summer of 1996 along the inner cycloptic wall excavations have shown strata of occupancy going back to the Neolithic period 7,000 to 5000 BC but the most outstanding features of the site were constructed during the early middle and late bronze ages 5,000 to 2,000 BC inscriptions found within the excavation go as far back as the Neolithic period and a sophisticated pictograph form of writing was developed as early as 200000 to 1800 VC Metallurgy the excavation has uncovered a large metal industry including a Foundry with two kinds of blast furnaces brick and INR metal processing at metsamor was among the most sophisticated of its kind at that time The Foundry extracted and processed high-grade gold copper several types of bronze mangines zinc strick nine Mercury and iron metsamor processed metal was coveted by all nearby cultures and found its way to Egypt Central Asia and China the iron smelting process was not advanced in metsamor probably due to the vast quantities of pure bronze Alloys at hand and metsamor primarily mined and sold iron ore to neighboring cultures which took better advantage of its properties The Foundry The Foundry dates from the early Bronze Age Circa 4,000 BC though recent digs in the area uncovered signs of metal processing as early as 5,000 BC the complex of smelting furnaces and molds date from the mid- bronze to early Iron Age 3000 to 2000 BC the complex becomes more astounding the more you walk through it several huge underground caves were uncovered that are thought to have been storehouses for base metal as well as Grainer for winter months stretching just below and around the upper Citadel the foundaries processed copper bronze iron Mercury mangines strick nine zinc and gold the first Iron in the ancient world was probably forged here though it was not considered as important as bronze giving the jump on development to the [Music] [Music] Babylonians the discovery of thousands of people buried in simple Graves and large burial mounts revealed a history of metsamor burial rituals and a concern for hiding wealthy tombs like the pharaohs buried in the Valley of the Kings metsamor rulers tried to thwart grave robbers by hiding the locations of Royal tombs fortunately the grave robbers at metsamor were not as lucky as those in Egypt and the mums revealed intact and richly adorned Burial Vaults giving us an excellent glimpse into the conditions for preparing the body for the afterlife among the artifacts uncovered in the Royal tombs were evidences of great wealth gold silver and bronze jewelry and adornments were found over and next to the body which was placed in a sitting fetal position in a large Stone sarcophagus early meore or lying in a casket late metsamor the bodies were laid out with their feet oriented toward the East so they could greet the Sun and follow it to the afterlife in the West other funeral objects discovered were rare amethyst bowls ornamented wooden caskets with inlaid covers glazed ceramic perfume bottles and ornaments of Gold Silver and semi-precious stones and paste decorated with traditional mythological scenes typical of local art Traditions Egyptian Central Asian and Babylonian objects were also found at the site indicating that from earliest of times metsamor was on the crossroads of travel routes spanning the Ararat plane and linking Asia Minor with the north Caucasus and Central Asia by the early Iron Age metsamor was one of the royal towns an administrative political and Cultural Center in the Ararat Valley the cyclopian walls the walls date from the 2 millennium BC when the site was fortified during the urartian era these stone blocks average 20 tons in weight and are more than 3 m thick in places during the middle bronze period late 3rd to mid2 millennium BC there was a surge of urban growth and development of complex architectural forms which extended the boundaries of the settlement to the area below the hill basically that area within the inner cyclopian walls are the older City and that Beyond represents newer areas by the 11th century BC the Central City occupied the lowland stretching from Lake akna and covered 100 hectares or 247 Acres the history of astronomy and astrology at matore the astronomical Observatory predates all other known observatories in the ancient world that is observatories that geometrically divided the heavens into constellations and assign them fixed positions and symbolic design until the discovery of metamor it had been widely accepted that the Babylonians were the first astronomers The Observatory at metamor predates the Babylonian Kingdom by 2,000 years and contains the first recorded example of dividing the year into 12 sections using an early form of geometry the inhabitants of metamor were able to create both a calendar and envision the curve of the earth it should be no surprise to anyone who knows something of armenia's history that a astronomy is such an important part of the national character sun symbols signs of the zodiac and ancient calendars predominated the region while the rest of the world was just coming alive culturally speaking Egypt and China were still Untamed Wilderness areas when the first Cosmic symbols began appearing on the side of the Gaga mountain range around 7,000 BC at metsamor Circa 5,000 BC one of the oldest observatories in the world can be found it sits on the southern edge of the excavated City a Promontory of red volcanic rocks that juts out like the Mast of a great ship into the heavens between 2800 and 2500 BCE at least three Observatory platforms were carved from the Rocks the metsamor observatory is an open book of ancient astronomy and sacred geometry for the average visitor the carvings are indecipherable messages the discovery of the astronomical Observatory at metsamor and the presence of Engravings which have been speculatively called zodiac creatures has given Credence to the assertion that the ancient figures of the constellations were probably created by ancient peoples living in the Euphrates Valley and near Mount Ararat in eastern Anatolia and Armenia the metamorans were a trade culture for trade you must have astronomy to know how to navigate the numerous inscriptions found at metsamor puzzled excavators as indecipherable as they were elaborate hundreds of small circular bowls were carved on the Rock surfaces connected by Thin troths and indented lines but one stood out it's an odd-shaped design that was a mystery to the excavators of the site until Professor par Manan discovered it was a key component to the large Observatory complex by taking a modern compass and placing it on the carving pars samian found that it pointed due north south and east it was one of the first compasses used in ancient times another carving on the platform shows four stars inside a trapezium the imaginary end of a line dissecting the trapezium matches the location of star which gave rise to Egyptian Babylonian and ancient Armenian religious worship The Observatory Rivals the discoveries that the Citadel for importance substantiating theories on the birthplace of the zodiac and origins of astronomy in the ancient world dated Circa 2800 to 2500 BC when a zodiac is figured to have been concluded the observatory was also the primary religious site and navigation center for the metamoran culture the metamoran worship of Sirius Sirius is most probably the star worshiped by the ancient inhabitants of metsamor between 2800 and 2600 BCE Sirus could have been observed from metsamor in the rising rays of the sun it's possible that like the ancient Egyptians the inhabitants of metamor related the first appearance of Sirius with the opening of the Year those wanting to plot the same event from metsamor will have to wait a while Sirius now appears in the winter Sky while the inhabitants of metsamor observed it in the summer because of the Earth's rotation within the rotation of the Milky Way galaxy Stars changed their positions over time in another 4,000 years or so Sirius will again appear as it is plotted on the metsamor Stellar map the metamorans also left behind a calendar divided into 12 months and made allowances for the leap year like the Egyptian calendar which had 365 days every 4 years the metamorans had to shift serious rising from one day of the month to the next with respect to metsamor whether it was the original homeland of the samarians or not metsamor had all the elements that the samarians had Metallurgy astronomy astrology and script writing you could put the origins of Eden there of which there is tantamount circumstantial evidence and it fits very well at one point Armenia original Homeland or not became a Samaran Outpost in the arachu cult just like the indis valley and just like Egypt Mesopotamia was situated in the center of all three absorbing minerals and trade to feed its flourishing civilizations the kingdoms of Samaria chose Mesopotamia as its epicenter just like the lapis lazuli they imported from vast distances metal ores were no different the kingdoms of Samaria truly traded on an epic scale [Music] kingdoms of Samaria gets heated this week as we get into the astronomy the Royal science of Mesopotamia we will touch on the research into Planet X ancient Star Charts sophisticated star cataloges and the origins of astrology don't forget you can watch all the episodes here in the dedicated playlist if you haven't come across cross the Babylonian star chart before you're in first [Music] surprise before we discuss anything regarding astronomy or astrology we must understand that in the ancient world there was no distinction between these two subjects they were one and the same in Civilization today we seem to be heavily focused on astronomy and have little regard for astrology our view of astrology however is distorted to the one of the past with the addition of variant forms of astrology Chinese vtic and Western the astronomy astrology of the past was known as The Royal science it was the rulers pharaohs and God Kings of the ancient world who possessed the power of these subjects an elite sect of astronomer priests who were under the command of the royal emperors it was an innocent science and practice developed by the samarians that became abused by later successors by the time of Neo Babylonia the astrology was a dominant aspect primarily for divination and control of the populace utilizing the framework of astronomical study like all information that's passed between cultures there's an advancement metamorphism either through manipulation or evolution in concept or both in kingdoms of Samaria particularly the god Kings of Mesopotamia you've seen the names of gods and their attributes are interwoven with astronomical detail as detailed in the king's list in our episode the legacy of Sumerian science you'll have seen the academic procedures of the clever Sumerians with incredible advancements we still struggle to comprehend in origins of the Samaran Savant we see Advanced calculus being used to calculate positions of planets now we're going to get into the body of astronomical knowledge they had the hardcore framework of what they knew about the stars planets motions of the heavens procession comets and Cycles is Earth shattering we will address the Nibiru Enigma briefly reserving full analysis for a special episode as it's such a huge controversial subject masked in layers of [Music] mystery the mpin star catalog of ancient Sumeria will form the backbone on this episode a researcher's dream loaded with clue after clue in the mysterious origins of astronomy it's a little known fact but the Babylonians had a comprehensive star catalog for academic study something we do today in the modern world of astrophysics the 18th century Messier catalog was the first compiled by Charles Messier and lists 100 objects nowadays we have much bigger ones the NGC catalog of 7,000 objects and the Monstrous IC index catalog the Babylonian version we call the Mula pin star catalog the conventional title from uniform texts is conceptually a masterpiece of what we call Modern thinking it wasn't rivaled until messier's catalog in 1771 the mola pin was likely compiled around 1,000 BC the text list the names of 66 Stars some version 71 and constellations and further gives indications such as rising setting and culmination dates that help to map out the basic structure of the sophisticated Babylonian star map again the Babylonians inherited this Legacy from the samarians as a hand-me-down both cultures are both often referred to as star mappers of the ancient world the Babylonian star map and the mapin catalog are Testament to this the Mula pin text is preserved in a s th Century BC copy on a pair of tablets named for their incipit corresponding to the first constellation of the Year Mula pin also known as the plow identified with triangulum plus gamma Andromeda constellation the earliest copy of the text so far discovered was made in 686 BC however most Scholars now believe that the text was originally compiled around 1,000 BC with the latest copies of bua pin are currently dated to around 300 BC astrophysicist Bradley Schaefer claims that the observations reported in these tablets were made in the region of assur at around the year 1370 BC the mola pin by this standard was an ancient Library document record tablet one of the Mula pin has been instrumental for reconstructing the Babylonian star chart this peculiar artifact tells us so many things about the ancient astronomers who gazed upon the Mesopotamia Skies there are many interpretations of the disc the most mindblowing is the observation of an asteroid in ancient Skies another genius concept to Aid in mapping the Stars its various sections locate the constellations in relation to each other and to the calendar all the major stars and constellation are listed and organized into three broad divisions according to Celestial latitude allocating each star to three paths utilizing the names of deities and gods the northern path of enil containing 33 stars or constellations the presumably equatorial path of Anu containing 23 stars or constellations and the southern path of EA containing 15 stars or constellations most of these stars and constellations are further attributed to a variety of NE Eastern deities the helical Rising dates of 34 stars and constellations are given according to the 360-day ideal calendar year the helal rising is what gives us Swiss watch Precision of dating as the Halal Rising occurs only once every 25,920 years accounting for precision the obsession with measuring the icle Rising is yet another commonality with Egypt and other [Music] cultures the details on the Mula pin text is unprecedented the list of stars and constellations that rise and set at the same time the number of days between the rising of various stars and constellations these stars and constellations that rise and culminate at the same time these stars on the path of the Moon being the major constellations close to the ecliptic which includes all the Babylonian forerunners to the zodiac constellations the dandera Zodiac in Egypt and its mysterious Origins is already there in textual form on cuni form in Samaria the intricate links between these two sister cultures are abundant even though the Babylonians used a looney solar calendar which added an occasional 13th month to the calendar Mula pin like most texts of Babylonian astrology uses an ideal year composed of 12 ideal months Each of which was composed of an ideal 30 days in this scheme the equinoxes were set on the 15th day of the 1st and 7th month and the solstices on the 15th day of the fourth and 10th month the second tablet of Mula pin is of Greater interest to historians of science as it delivers many of the methods and procedures used by Babylonian astrologers to predict the movements of the sun moon and planets as well as the various methods used to regulate the calendar [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] details of the names of the Sun the planets and the assertion that they all travel the same path as the moon which stars are rising and which contain the full moon on the solstices and equinoxes to judge the disparity of the lunar and solar Cycles recommendations for observing the appearance of certain stars and the direction of the wind at the time of their first appearance veryy approximate values for the number of days that each planet is visible and invisible during its observational cycle the four stars associated with the four directional winds the dates when the sun is present in each of the three Stellar paths two types of intercalation scheme one uses the rising dates of certain Stars while the other uses position of the moon in relation to the stars and constellations the relative duration of day and night at the solstices and equinoxes and the lengths of shadow cast by a Goman at various times of the day at the solstices and equinoxes a basic mathematical scheme giving the rising and setting times of the Moon in each month a selection of astrological Omens there's some evidence that a third and so far unrecovered tablet was sometimes appended to the series it started with a section of scholarly explanations of celestial Omens which brings us to the ultimate doomsday Omens of the heavens the observations of comet Haley's Comet was a favorite amongst Babylonian Scholars the wonderful aspect of this ancient astronomical observation is the cross verification of the dating we never ceased to be amazed at the ancient Sumerian Tablets and their contents evidence on a Babylonian uniform tablet recorded Hal's comet in 164 BC came to light in recent years written by a Babylonian scribe about a rare phenomenon familiar to use as Haley's Comet the only short period Comet visible to the naked eye the comet which previously had been in the East reported the ancient scribe in 164 BC became visible and passed along the path of EA in the west his words chronicled the appearance of Hal's Comet the tablet recorded the 164 BC passage of Hal's comet is displayed alongside another describing the comet's return in 87 BC well the British museum has had the these Babylonian tablets for over a century their references to the comet were only recognized in modern times the 76-year comet was also monitored by the Chinese for 2,150 years from 240 BC onwards the significance of both these cultures is the precise dating and verification of the astronomical detail in chronologies the other significance is that comets have always been perceived as harbingers of Doom for very good reason deeply embedded in the psyche of all ancient cultures and mythology we see astrology move away from behaviorism of people born at certain months people born under constellations and into divination of the Neo Babylonian period as there was a systematic demand for Omens good or bad from the Kingdom's rulers the origins of Western astronomy can be found in Mesopotamia and all Western efforts in the exact Sciences are descendants in direct line from the work of the late Babylonian astronomers astronomy and astrology were fused together in ancient times the dandera zodiac is now in a Paris Museum and shows the advanced mindset of ancient astronomy and how it was likely born out of Mesopotamia science modern knowledge of Samarian astronomy is indirect via the earliest Babylonian star catalog dating from about 1200 BC the fact that many star names appear in Samaran suggests a continuity reaching into the early Bronze Age we have a date for the Babylonian star map putting it mysteriously in the third millennium BC technically it should be called the Sumerian starm map for its era yet it was found in the library of Asher banal in Assyria in the 7th Century BC what we can tell with this Babylonian star map is that in the 3D millennium BC there was a sophisticated astronomy somehow astronomy went underground only to Blossom again in the Babylonian era 1800 BC onwards Babylonian astronomy was like a Renaissance period which finally became embroiled in divination astrology in the Neo Assyrian and neo-babylonian Empires amazingly upon examination of the Babylonian starm map clay tablets it revealed is a mysterious object in the skies it displays astronomical work as it has drawings of constellations on it and the text is known constellation names it has attracted a lot of attention but in over a 100 Years yet nobody has come up with a convincing explanation as to what it is with modern computer programs that can simulate trajectories and reconstruct the night sky thousands of years ago the researchers have established what the planisphere tablet refers to to it's a copy of the night notebook of an unknown Samarian astronomer as he records the events in the sky Before Dawn in June 3,123 BC Julian calendar half the tablet records Planet positions and cloud cover the same as any other night but the other half of the tablet records an object large enough for its shape to be noted even though it's still in space presumably an asteroid during the 8th and 7th centuries BC Babylonian astronomers developed a new empirical approach to astronomy they began studying philosophy dealing with the ideal nature of the universe and began employing an internal logic within their predictive planetary systems this was an important contribution to astronomy and the philosophy of science and some Scholars have thus referred to this new approach as the first Scientific Revolution this new approach to astronomy was adopted and further developed in Greek and helenistic astronomy classical Greek and Latin sources frequently use the term Chelan for the astronomers of Mesopotamia who were priest scribes specializing in astrology and other forms of divination the significant point of all this is that mere fragments of Babylonian astronomy have survived consisting largely of contemporary clay tablets containing astronomical Diaries ephemerides and procedural texts hence current knowledge of Babylonian astronomy is in a fragmentary state the surviving fragments show that Babylonian astronomy was the first successful attempt at giving a refined mathematical description of astronomical phenomena and that all subsequent varieties of scientific astronomy in the helenistic world in India in Islam and in the west depend upon Babylonian astronomy in decisive and fundamental ways just how old is Babylonian astronomy then old Babylonian astronomy was practiced during and after the first Babylonian Dynasty Circa 1830 BC and before the Neo Babylonian Empire Circa 626 BC from the Samaran names and the Babylonian star chart showing Samaran night skies in 3123 BC from Asher bonana paal's library of 700 BC area it's obvious that samarians passed knowledge to Babylonians which by the time of 700 BC was descending Into the Dark Ages it's best to think what we can learn from the fragments left behind instead of attributing who invented what and when clearly on multiple levels we see time and again the Babylonians as inheritors of knowledge of the samarians the Babylonians were the first to recognize that astronomical phenomena are periodic and apply mathematics to their predictions tablets dating back to the old Babylonian period document the application of mathematics to the variation in the length of daylight over a solar year centuries of Babylonian observations in Celestial phenomena were recorded in the series of uniform tablets known as anuma Anu and Lil the oldest significant astronomical text that we possess is tablet 63 of the anuma Anu and Lil the Venus tablet of Amad Dua which lists the first and last visible risings of Venus over a period of about 21 years this is the earliest evidence that planetary phenomena were recognized as periodic the Moola pin contains cataloges of stars and constellations as well as schemes for predicting Halal risings and settings of the planet and lengths of daylight as measured by a water clock gnomen shadows and inner calculations the Babylonian text arranges stars in strings that lie along declination circles and thus measure right ascensions or time intervals also employs the stars of the Zenith which are also separated by given right Ascension differences there are dozens of uniform Mesopotamian texts with real observation of eclipses mainly Babylonian the Babylonians were the first civilization known to possess a functional theory of the planets the oldest surviving planetary astronomical text is the Babylonian Venus tablet of Amy seduka a 7th Century BC copy of a list of observations of the emotions of the planet Venus that probably dates as early as the second millennium BC time and again we see 7th Century BC copies survive of second Millennia BC data the Babylonian astrologers also laid the foundations of what would eventually become Western astrology the anuma Anu and Lil written during the Neo Assyrian period in the 7th Century BC it comprises a list of Omens and their relationships with various Celestial phenomena including the Motions of the planets in contrast to the worldview presented in Mesopotamia and Assyria Babylonian literature particularly in Mesopotamian and Babylonian mythology very little is known about the cosmology and world view of the ancient Babylonian astrologers and astronomers this is largely due to the current fragmentary state of Babylonian planetary Theory also due to Babylonian astronomy being independent from cosmology at the time nevertheless traces of cosmology can be found in Babylonian literature and myth [Music] [Music] ology [Music] in Babylonian cosmology the earth and the heavens were depicted as a spatial hole even one of round shape with references to the circumference of Heaven and Earth and the totality of Heaven and Earth their worldview was not exactly geocentric either the the idea of geocentric ISM where the center of the earth is the exact center of the universe did not yet exist in Babylonian cosmology but was established later by the Greek philosopher aristotles on the heavens in contrast Babylonian cosmology suggested that the cosmos revolved around circularly with the heavens and the Earth being equal and joined the Babylonians and their predecessors the samarians also believed in plurality of heavens and Earths this idea dates to Samarian incantations in the second millennium BC which refers to there being seven heavens and seven Earths linked possibly chronologically to the creation by the seven generations of gods Neo Babylonian astronomy refers to the astronomy developed by Chelan astronomers during the Neo Babylonian eamed saluci and parean periods of Mesopotamian history a significant increase inre in the quality and frequency of Babylonian observations appeared during the reign of naban naer 747 to 734 BC the systematic records of ominous phenomena in Babylonian astronomical diaries that began at this time allowed for the discovery of a repeating 18-year sorrow cycle of lunar eclipses for example the Greco Egyptian astronomer t\u00e9 later used nabinas Reign to fix the beginning of of an era since he felt that the earliest usable observations began at this time Babylonian astrology as well as an Assyrian was a direct offshoot of Babylonian culture astrology takes its place as one of the Two Chief means at the disposal of the priests also known as the inspectors for ascertaining the will and intention of the Gods using solar and lunar eclipse precise position of planets Babylonian astrology was the first organized system of astrology arising in the second millennium BC there's speculation that astrology of some form appeared in the Samaran period in the 3rd millennium BC but the isolated references to ancient Celestial Omens dated to this period are not considered sufficient evidence to demonstrate an integrated theory of astrology this is largely a misunderstanding as ancient astrology the behavioral Suns sign astrology from Samaran and old Bab iian standards was completely different to Neo Babylonian divination astrology the history of scholarly Celestial divination is therefore generally reported to begin with late old Babylonian texts cira 1800 BC continuing through the middle Babylonian and middle Assyrian period Circa 1200 BC by the 6th Century BC the extensive employment of omen based astrology can be evidenced in the compilation of a comprehensive reference work known as enuma Anu and Lil its contents consisted of 70 uniform tablets comprising 7,000 Celestial Omens texts from this time also refer to an oral tradition the origin and content of which can only be speculated upon at that time B bonian astrology was solely mundane and prior to the 7th Century BC the practitioners understanding of astronomy was rudimentary there was clearly a descent in the astronomy and an Ascent in The Omen astrology giving rise to two different fields because of their inability to accurately predict future Celestial phenomena and planetary movement very far in advance interpretations were done as the phenomena occurred or slightly before by the 4th Century however their mathematical methods had progressed enough to calculate future planetary positions with reasonable accuracy at which point extensive ephemerides began to [Music] appear the gods were also believed to present themselves in the celestial images of the planets or stars with whom they were Associated evil Celestial Omens attached to any specific Planet were therefore seen as indications of dissatisfaction or disturbance of the god that planet represented such indications were met with attempts to appease the God and find manageable Ways by which the God's expression could be realized without significant harm to the King and his Nation an astronomical report to the king Esser hen concerned a lunar eclipse of January 673 BC shows how the ritualistic use of substitute Kings or substitute events combined an unquestioning belief in Magic and Omens with a purely mechanical view that the astrological event must have some correlation with the natural world as follows in the Kingdom of the year a flood will come and break the dkes when the moon is made the eclipse the king my Lord should write to me as a substitute for the king I will cut through a dyke here in Babylonia in the middle of the night no one will know about it aola cooch Weston Holtz in her 1995 book Mesopotamian astrology argues that this ambivalence between a theistic and a mechanic worldview defines the Babylonian concept of celestial divination as one which despite its heavy Reliance on Magic remains free of implications of targeted punishment with the purpose of Revenge and so shares some of the defining traits of modern science it's objective and value-free it operates according to the known rules and its data are considered universally valid and can be looked up in written tabulations cooch Weston hols also establishes the most important distinction between ancient Babylonian astrology and other divination disciplines as being that the former was originally exclusively mundane being geographically oriented and specifically applied to countries cities and Nations and almost wholly concerned with the welfare of the state and the King as the governing head of the nation planets and gods of the planets five were recognized Jupiter Venus Saturn Mercury and Mars to name them an order in which they appear in the older uniform literature in later texts Mercury and Saturn change places these five planets were identified with the gods of the Babylonian Pantheon as follows Jupiter with Marduk Venus with the goddess Ishtar Saturn with nerta Mercury with Nabu and Mars with nural the movements of the sun moon and five planets were regarded as representing the activity of the five gods in question together with the moon God sin and the sun god shamash in preparing the occurrences on Earth if therefore one could correctly read and interpret the activity of these Powers one knew what the gods were aiming to bring about the Babylonian priest accordingly applied themselves to the tasks of perfecting a system of interpretation of the phenomena to be observed in the heavens and it was natural that the system was extended from the Moon Sun and five planets to the more prominent and recognizable fixed Stars Association of ideas involving sometimes merely a play upon words in connection with the phenomenon or phenomena observed thus if on a certain occasion the rise of the new moon in a cloudy sky was followed by victory over an enemy or by Abundant rain the sign in question was thus Prov to be a favorable one and its reoccurrence would thenceforth be regarded as a good omen though the prognostication would not necessarily be limited to the one or the other of these occurrences but might be extended to apply to other circumstances on the other hand the appearance of the new moon earlier than was expected was regarded as UNF favorable prognosticating in one case defeat in another death among cattle in a third bad crops none of this necessarily because the events took place after such a phenomenon but by an application of the general principle resting upon Association of ideas whereby anything premature would suggest an unfavorable occurrence [Music] in this way a massive traditional interpretation of all kinds of observed phenomena was gathered and once gathered became a guide to the priests for all times however not all these ideas are still used in astrology as it is usually practiced today a lot of astronomy tablets survive because of Asher bopal's uniform Library Asher banipal was a king of Assyria who ruled in the 7th Century BC from 668 to 625 he was famous for assembling a great library of uniform tablets in Nineveh about astrology history mythology and science some of assur banana Pal's astrologers such as ramanu sumasar and Nabu musisi became so Adept at deducing Omens from daily movements of the planets that a system of making periodical reports to the king came into being thus assur bonap paal received Swift Messengers detailing all occurrences in Heaven and Earth throughout his kingdom and the results of his astrologers examinations of them he then used this information as a political weapon and for the Practical day-to-day running of his kingdom after his death Nineveh fell to the mes and the Chelan Babylonians and aser bopal's library was destroyed or dispersed [Music] [Music] just [Music] how astronomical information was handled and manipulated is something you must deeply consider when we discuss our final topic of the notorious Nibiru from various Babylonian star cataloges the Mula pin and others we have numerous resources that mention Nibiru what exactly Nibiru is open to heated debate Babylonian astronomy collated earlier observations and divinations into sets of Babylonian star cataloges during and after the cite rule over Babylonia these star cat ogs written in CI form script contain lists of constellations individual stars and planets the constellations were probably collected from various other sources the earliest catalog three stars each mentioned stars of accad and amuru or aam and others it must be noted that the several times Nibiru is mentioned from all sources like the mapin and Astro B Star cataloges the anuma Alish and others we are likely dealing with different authors and completely different intentions honorable or otherwise for writing the references of Nibiru we know these cataloges are referring to real astronomical phenomena such as constellations and planets various sources have theorized a Samaran origin for these Babylonian constellations but An alamite Origin has also been proposed a connection to the star symbology of cite kaduru border Stones has also been claimed but whether such kadur Rus really represented constellations and astronomical information aside from the use of these symbols remains unclear the Babylonian star cataloges entered Greek astronomy in the 4th Century BC via uus of citis and others a few of the constellation names in use in modern astronomy can be traced to Babylonian sources via Greek astronomy among the most ancient constellations are those that marked the four cardinal points of the year in the middle Bronze Age in other words Taurus the ball from mulu ANA the steer of Heaven marking vernal equinox Leo the lion from mure Gula the lion marking summer solstice Scorpius the Scorpion from mul gear tab the Scorpion marking Autumn Equinox capricornus horned goat from musul heras the goat fish marking winter solstice it's a mythological hybrid depicted on Boundary stones from before 2000 BC as a symbol of EA there are other constellation names which can be traced to Bronze Age Origins including Gemini the twins from mlus tabba galal The Great twins cancer the crab from molal lul the crayfish among others to pinpoint Nibiru like constellations is nearly impossible the Mesopotamian sources clearly and repeatedly referred to something called nairu The Mention Of Nibiru several times as an observed astronomical object is fact it's both referred to as a star and as a planet at various times outside astronomical text Nibiru can mean several place of Crossing in the Gilgamesh epic we read the line straight is the crossing point Nibiru a Gateway and narrow is the way that leads to it niiro is referring to an astronomical body that can be complicated the following chart represents a complete listing of the word Nibiru in astronomical texts and or astronomical contexts superscripted D the uniform sign for God dinger and so nabiru may refer to a god recall that Sumerians and Mesopotamians Associated heavenly bodies with deities superscripted Mo the uniform sign for star and so nabiru is a star Nibiru is preceded by both D and Mo and so is referred to as a deity and a star in the texts that follow Nibiru was regarded as a planet specifically Jupiter but once as mercury a god specifically Marduk and a star distinguished from Jupiter Scholars of CI form astronomy have not been able to determine with certainty what exactly Nibiru is there are critics Skeptics and Believers of the Planet X or planet of the crossing Theory this planet of the crossing is a fair interpretation of the Mesopotamian data as muddled and confusing as it is it's not proof nor is it disproved that the critics based on Samaran texts to ignore there are several authors of nibiro observations and ignore the descent into astrology is misleading in the research for kingdoms of Samaria we've seen multiple times Mesopotamia data become diluted corrupted manipulated and devolve as the Babylonian and Assyrian cultures died out the earliest sources of Niro are likely the correct ones and like the astrology business for the rulers and later descending cultur there was less focus on astronomical fact and more on Omens references to Nibiru as Jupiter are likely deceptive even in ancient times Jupiter with Advanced calculus in the old Babylonian period they knew exactly what it was the only thing have done has proven that hero is a planet of the crossing is a viable Theory there's also the slight problem of the iris data the discovery of an infrared object possibly a brown dwarf in our nearby solar system now swept under the rug in addition the fact that they've discovered Planet X in 2016 but calling it Planet 9 as a deliberate misleading trick the Royal science of astronomy was high and became convoluted with a focus on astrology originally the fixing of the zodiac constellations on the equator with the Taurus Scorpio axis never deviating over eons was revolutionary these samarians acadians and Babylonians were star mappers of the ancient world they observed everything in the heaven asteroids comets and rogue planets amongst the rest of the day-to-day astronomy our world would have never Advanced without [Music] them this week the spiritual beliefs of the ancient Sumerians are under a microscope kingdoms of Maria is lifting the veil mysterious group known glob globally as The Shining ones also known anunaki in Mesopotamia these gods and their descendants who civilized man left a planetary [Music] footprint [Music] [Music] what or who are The Shining ones it's possibly the biggest question to come out of patamia it's such a unique specific terminology cribe a group of beings entities or deities however the shiny as they're referred to in so many ancient cultures and texts all supposedly independent from each other they're often given specific names in those cultures yet their nickname The Shining ones whatever the attribution of shining means is a nickname that stuck across vast distances and epochs in Mesopotamia they were referred to as the abalu the Anunnaki or U generally they're described as serpent beings seven sages fish beings feathered serpents Angels Watchers or Elders in ancient Egypt they went by the name of natu or shemsu wh the dogon cultur spin off from Egypt they were called the nomos in India they bore names like dvas or nagas biblical accounts give them or their descendant names like Elohim Nephilim gorim seraphim or RAF Fame whether World mythologies religious or ancient historical texts there is repetitive specific references to a group of divinity known as The Shining ones they're often presented as gifted individuals preservers of ancient knowledge they're often described as amazing deities who created Mankind and walked among humans as beings of Flesh and Blood at the same time they are also described as serpent fishlike Angels or birdmen the Mesopotamian term appu is used to represent a winged deity protector Spirit sometimes human or eagle-headed new Cutting Edge technology allows us to bring the original color of these wall reliefs back to life without harming them it really does Center on how we can begin to look at the art in our collection in different ways reconstruct a little bit of what the ancient viewer may have been able to see uh in uh in the 9th century BCE and uh do it in a way that doesn't harm the work of art uh allows us a certain kind of flexibility in terms of what we can we can show uh and in terms of how knowledge is evolving and to also allow us kind of a a an opportunity to imagine how we could take a project similar to this and move it not just to another Assyrian relief but other works of art and think about the uh the applications and the ways that we can uh we can work with in our episode The God Kings of Mesopotamia we touched upon the apalo however the apalo certainly in later Babylonian times may have simply been some priesthood reenacting rituals associated with the original shining ones mythology oral history and symbolism May well be the only method of knowledge keeping that lasts the ravages of time texts degrade maybe they last Millennia but eventually all disintegrate mythology and symbolism is not a perfect recordkeeping mechanism it morphs over long epochs yet it does also preserve a core remnant of the original thought process clearly this works or we wouldn't see serpent mythology on a global scale or knowledge of a mysterious group known in antiquity as The Shining ones touch every corner of the planet eventually patriarchy took control of the planet literally most certainly from the time of the Romans onwards knowledge of The Shining ones and their wisdom was effectively ethnically cleansed the church tried to erase everything they could from history at least from public view The Book of Enoch contains valuable information on The Shining ones the major reason why it was excluded from the Bible it's a fact that the church denied the world any knowledge of the work's true content for over a thousand years as we've already seen the majority of biblical Source material comes from Mesopotamia the Gilgamesh flood epic Abraham zigurat of or Armenia the land of Noah the Garden of Eden serpents forbidden knowledge to name a popular few when the last great Mesopotamia culture died out with Alexander the Great conquering Persia so did a lineage of knowledge enter the Greco Roman period civilization and that's when the ethnic cleansing of The Shining ones begins almost impossible to State the origins of the shiny ones however one distinguished author has given us tremendous Insight the mysterious origins of gockley teepe may have been an outpost where The Shining ones practice their rituals only 15 miles from morac birthplace of agriculture religion and astronomy The Shining On's Mesopotamian Regional name was anuna today they are more popularly known as the anunaki although there are many other variations this group of deities appears in the mythological traditions of the ancient samarians acadians Assyrians and Babylonians descriptions of how many Anunnaki there were and what role they fulfilled are inconsistent and often contradictory in the earliest Samaran writings discussing the anuna comes from the post Acadian period the anuna are the most powerful deities in the pantheon descendants of Anu the god of the heavens and their primary function is popularly accepted as decreeing the fates of humanity the Nimrod sculptures at the British museum are not merely artistic in the following clip we will see the dragon bell being slayed by Marduk art and imagery straight out of the Epic of Gilgamesh itself a major source of material on Anunnaki [Music] [Music] Chinese IU in aad or an in Samaran literally mean Sky Heaven it's the Divine personification of the sky supreme god and ancestor of all the deities in ancient Mesopotamian religion Anu was believed to be the Supreme source of all authority for the other gods and for all Mortal rulers and he's described in one text as the one who contains the entire universe he is identified with the north ecliptic pole centered in Draco and along with the sons an leil and enki constitutes the highest Divine Triad personifying the three bands of constellations of the Vault of the Sky by the time of the earliest written records Anu was rarely worshiped and the veneration was instead devoted to his son and Leo but throughout Mesopotamian history the highest deity in the pantheon was always said to possess the Anu meaning Anu power anu's primary role in myths is as the an Anor of the anunaki the major deities of Samaran religion his primary cult Center was the aana temple in the city of aroo but by the Acadian period his authority in aroo had largely been seated to the goddess inana the Queen of Heaven anu's consort in the earliest Samaran text is the goddess Urus but she's later the goddess key and in a Cadian text the Gess Anu whose name is the feminine form of Anu Anu briefly appears in the Acadian Epic of Gilgamesh in which his daughter Ishtar the East Semitic equivalent to Anana persuades him to give her the bull of heaven so that she may send it to attack gilgames the incident results in the death of

was worshiped in the inan temple of urach a cult Center for The Shining ones in the Samaran epic in's descent into The Nether world the Anunnaki shining ones are portrayed as seven judges who sit Before the Throne of Ares kagal in the Underworld later Acadian Texs such as the Epic of Gilgamesh follow this portrayal during the old Babylonian period the anunaki were believed to be the cathic deities of the underworld while the gods of the heavens were known as the igigi the ancient Hittites identified the Anunnaki as the oldest generation of gods who had been overthrown and banished to the underworld by the younger gods inana was the anaki Sumerian goddess of love fertility War Justice and power she was even called the Queen of Heaven and was worshiped in the inan temple of uro a cult center for the shiny ones the name anunaki is derived from an the Samaran god of the sky the name is variously written danuna danuna K danuna meaning princely Offspring or offspring of Anu the anunaki were believed to be The Offspring of an and his consort the Earth goddess Keith a serologist Samuel Noah crram identifies key with the Samaran mother goddess Niners sag stating that they were originally the same figure the oldest of the anunaki was enil the god of ER and chief god of the Samaran Pantheon the samarians believed that until enil was born Heaven and Earth were inseparable then and leil cleaved Heaven and Earth in Che and carried away the Earth will his father Anu carried away the sky the Anunnaki are chiefly mentioned in literary text and very little evidence to support the existence of any Cult of them has yet been Unearthed this is likely because each member of the Anunnaki had his or her individual cult separate from the others similarly no representations of the anunaki as a group have yet been discovered although a few depictions of its individual members have been identified deities in Mesopotamia were almost exclusively anthromorphic they were thought to possess extraordinary power and were often envisioned as being of tremendous physical size the deities typically wore melum and ambiguous substance which covered them in terrifying Splendor melum could also be worn by Heroes Kings Giants and even demons the effect that seeing a deity's melum has on a human is described as KNE a word for the physical tingling of the flesh deities were almost always depicted wearing horn caps consisting of up to seven superimposed pairs of oxh horns they were also sometimes depicted wearing clothes with elaborate decorative gold and silver ornaments swn into them the ancient Mesopotamians believed that their deities lived in heaven but that a God's statue was a physical embodiment of the God himself as such cult statues were given constant care and attention and a set of priests were assigned to tend to them these priests would clothe the statues and place feasts before them so they could eat a deity Temple was believed to be that deity's literal place of residence the gods had boats full-sized barges which were normally stored inside their Temple and were used to transport their cult statues along waterways during various religious festivals the gods also had chariots which were used for transporting their cult Statues by land sometimes a deity statue would be transported to the location of a battle so that the deity could watch the battle unfold the major deities of Mesopotamian Pantheon which include the Anunnaki were believed to participate in the Assembly of the Gods through which gods made all their decisions this assembly was a Divine counterpart to the semi-democratic legislative system that existed during the third dynasty of UR Circa 2112 BC to 2004 BC the earliest known usages of the term Anunnaki come from the inscriptions written during the reign of guda 2144 to 2124 BC and the third dynasty of or in the earliest text the chm is applied to the most powerful and important deities in the Samaran Pantheon the descendants of the sky God an this group of deities probably includes the seven gods who decree an and leil Ani ninag Nana utu and [Music] inana although certain deities are described as members of the anunaki no complete list of the names of all the Anunnaki has survived and they're usually only referred to as a cohesive group in literary text furthermore Samaran text described the Anunnaki inconsistently and do not agree on how many anunaki there were or what their Divine function was originally the Anunnaki appeared to have been Heavenly deities with immense powers in the poem Anki in the world order the anunaki do homage to eni sing hymns of praise and his honor and take up their dwellings among the people of sume the same composition repeatedly states that the Anunnaki decree the fates of mankind time and fate deities are personifications of time often in the sense of human lifetime and human fate in polytheistic religions in monotheism time can be personified as in Father time in European folklore or in Persian zor Doro estan tradition virtually every major deity in the Samaran Pantheon was regarded as the patron of a specific City and was expected to protect that City's interest the deity was believed to permanently reside within the city's temple one text mentions as many as 50 Anunnaki associated with the city of IDU Samarian poetry is loaded with references to The anaki Shining ones one such poem called anan's descent to the underworld is essentially reading to understand why the anaki shiny ones closely resemble the Watchers or Fallen [Music] ones in Ina's descent into The Nether world there are only seven Anunnaki who reside within the underworld and serve as judges inana stands trial before them for her attempt to take over the underworld they deem her guilty of Hu and condemn her to death major deities in Samaran mythology were associated with specific celestial bodies inana was believed to be the planet Venus uchu was believed to be the sun Nana was the moon an was identified with all the stars in the equatorial sky and leel with those of the northern sky and Ani with those in the southern Sky the path of en's celestial orbit was a continuous symmetrical circle around the north Celestial Pole but those of an and enki were believed to intersect at various points Acadian texts of the second millennium BC follows similar portrayals of the Anunnaki from Ina's descent into The Nether world depicting them as konic underworld deities in an abbreviated Acadian version of Ina's descent written in the early second Millennium aresh kagal the queen of the underworld comments that she drinks water with the Anunnaki later in the same poem Ares kagal offers her servant Namar to fetch the Anunnaki from Al Galina to decorate the threshold steps with coral and to seat them on Golden Thrones in Mesopotamian mythology Ares kagal literally means Queen of the great Earth was the goddess of Kor the Land of the Dead Or underworld in Samaran mythology in later East Semitic myths she was said to rule irala alongside her husband nargal some her name is given as eala like the way the name Hades was given Greek mythology for both the underworld and and sometimes it's given as ninal literally great lady of the Earth or Lady of the great Earth in Samarian text Ares kagal was the only one who could pass judgment and give laws in her kingdom the main Temple dedicated to her was in CA in the ancient Samarian poem in an's descent to the underworld ragal is described as Ana's older sister the two main myths involving Arash kagal are the story of Ana's desent into the underworld and the story of Ares gal's marriage to the god naral another amazing work of poetry reg regarding the shiny ones is concerning nural nural is the king into a battle delivering death to the enemy death brought on by nurel also had a supernatural Dimension disease often being attributed to demonic activity Mesopotamia in ancient Samarian mythology Ares kagal is the queen of the underworld she's the older sister of the Goddess Anana Anana and ares kagal represent Polar Opposites Anana is the Queen of Heaven but Ares kagal is the queen ofala Ares kagal plays a very prominent and significant role in two myths most most notably Ina's descent into the underworld in the poem The Goddess inana descends into the underworld apparently seeking to extend her powers there Ares kagal is Ana's older sister when NTI the gatekeeper of the underworld informs Ares kagal that Anana is at the gates of the underworld demanding to be let in Ares kagal responds by ordering NTI to bolt the seven Gates of the underworld and to open each gate separately but only after Anana has removed one article of clothing inana proceeds through each gate removing one article of clothing at each gate finally once she's gone through all seven Gates she finds herself naked and Powerless standing Before the Throne of Ares kagal these seven judges of the underworld judge Anana and declare her to be guilty Anana is struck dead and her dead corpse is hung on a hook in the Underworld for everyone to see Ana's Minister nin shabor however pleads with enki and enki agrees to rescue Anana from the underworld Ani sends two sexless beings down to the underworld to revive Anana with the blood and Water of Life the sexless beings escort Anana up from the underworld but a horde of angry demons follow Anana back up from the underworld demanding to take someone else down to the underworld as Ana's replacement when Anana discovers that her husband deid has not mourn her death she becomes eful towards him and orders the demons to take deid as her replacement the other myth is the story of nural the plague God once the gods held a banquet that arish kagal as Queen of the underworld could not come up to attend they invited her to send a messenger and she sent her Vier Namar in her place he was treated well by all but for the exception of being disrespected by nural because of this nural was banished to the kingdom controlled by the goddess versions vary at this point but all of them result in him becoming her husband in later tradition nural is said to have been the Victor taking her as wife and ruling the land himself it's theorized that the story of Ina's descent is told to illustrate the possibility of an escape from the underworld where the nurth is intended to reconcile the existence of two rulers of the underworld a goddess and a God the addition of nural represents the harmonizing tendency to unite Ares kagal as the queen of the underworld with The God Who as God of War and pestilence brings death to the living and thus becomes the one who presides over the dead in some versions of the myths Ares kagal rules the underworld by herself but in other versions of the myth Ares kagal rules alongside a husband subordinate to her named galana let's take a look right now and reflect upon the work of Samuel Noah Kramer a Sumerian academic whose work on the anaki research is astounding his own self-proclaimed Obsession was fueled by the Intrigue into the shiny ones who they were and a journey down the rabbit hole of [Music] Truth in his book Sumerian mythology a study of spiritual and literacy achievement in the 3rd millennium BC the renowned scholar of ancient Su samuela Kramer writes that according to the introductory passage of the ancient Samarian epic poem Gilgamesh and kidu in the Underworld Ares kagal was forcibly abducted taken down to the underworld by K and was forced to become Queen of the underworld against her will to avenge the Abduction of Ares kagal Ani the god of water set out in a boat to slay the core the core defends itself by pelting Ani with rocks of many sizes and by sending the waves beneath anki's boat to attack eni the poem never actually explains who the ultimate Victor of the battle is but it's implied that enky wins Samuel Noah Kramer relates this myth to the ancient Greek myth of the rape of pany asserting that the Greek story is probably derived from the ancient Samaran story in hittite mythology the sun goddess of the earth rules as an underworld deity though the deity is of likely Proto indoeuropean origin this is an aspect thought to have been influenced by aresa here you can see depicted an early 19th century drawing of the statuette of Hecate with whom Ares kagal was syncretized in later times the Greeks and Romans appear to have syncretized Ares kagal with their own goddess Hecate in the heading of a spell in the Michigan magical Papyrus which has been dated to the late 3rd or early 4th Century ad heate is referred to as heate arkal and is invoked using magical words and gestures to alleviate the Caster's fear of punishment in the afterlife during the old Babylonian period circus 1830 BC to 1531 BC a new set of deities known as the igigi are introduced the relationship between Anunnaki and the aigi is unclear on some occasions the categories appear to be used synonymously but in other writings such as the poem of era there's a clear distinction between the two in the late Acadian atrasis epic the IGI are the sixth generation of the Gods who are forced to perform labor for the Anor Aki after 40 days the yigi rebel and the God eni one of the anunaki creates humans to replace them the poem of era and Isham a Babylonian Pit's view of war is perhaps the most important or more important than the Epic of Gilgamesh so popular in fact that more copies of this ancient poetry have been found than Gilgamesh era sometimes called era is an Acadian plague God known for an epos of 8th Century BCE era is the god of Mayhem and pestilence who's responsible for periods of political confusion in that epic that's given the modern title era the writer kopti elani Marduk a descendant he says of daibi presents himself in a cifone following the text as simply the transcriber of a Visionary dream in which era himself revealed the text the poem opens with an invocation the god era is sleeping fitfully with his consort identified with mamum and not with the other goddess Mami but is roused by his adviser Isam and the seven sibiti or CTI who are sons of Heaven and Earth Champions without Pier is the repeated formula and each are assigned a destructive Destiny by Anu the sabidi call on era to lead the destruction of mankind isim tries to to mify era's weakened violence to no avail foreign people invade Babylonia but are struck down by plague even Marduk the patron of Babylon relinquishes his throne to era for a Time tablets 2 and three are occupied with a debate between era and Isam era goes to battle in Babylon Sapar Uruk dur kurri Galu and dar the world is turned upside down righteous and unrighteous are killed alike era orders isim to complete the work by defeating babylon's enemies then the god withdraws to his own seat in emsam with the terrifying seven and Mankind is saved a proprietary prayer ends the work the Palm must have been Central to Babylonian culture at least 36 copies have been recovered from five first Millennium sites assur Babylon Nineveh Sultan tape and Ur more even than have been recovered of the Epic of gilgames the text appears to to some readers to be a mythologization of historic turmoil in Mesopotamia those Scholars disagree as to the historic events that inspired the poem The Poet explains tablet 43 you changed out your Divinity and made yourself like a man the AA text soon assumes magical functions parts of the text were inscribed on amulets employed for exorcism and as prophylactic against the plague these seven are known from a range of Cadian incantation texts their demonic names vary but their number seven is invariable the five tablets containing the era epos were first published in 1956 with an improved text based on additional finds appearing in 1969 perhaps 70% of the poem has been recovered the consonant of the purely Mythic 7 led by Era Echoes with the Egyptian seven against thieves widely assumed by helist to have had a historical basis from the middle Babylonian period Circa 1592 to 1155 BC onward the name Anunnaki was applied generally to the deities of the underworld whereas the name igigi was applied to the Heavenly deities during this period the underworld deities damina Nal and Madu are listed as the most powerful among the Anunnaki alongside Marduk the national God of ancient Babylon in the standard Acadian Epic of Gilgamesh Circa 1200 BC utnapishtim The Immortal survivor of the great flood describes the Anunnaki as seven judges of the underworld who set the land of flame as the storm approaches later when the flood comes Ishtar the East Semitic equivalent to Anana and the anunaki mourn over the destruction of humanity the enuma Elish or a 1,000 line poem gives an idea as to the numbers of anaki as we have the numbers uh we understand they're going into war battling for power yet at the same time coming from the underworld un comfortably it is recognized as being related to the Hebrew Genesis creation narrative in the same way Persia adopted Samarian writing winged bulls and spiritual beliefs of the samarians the hites in Turkey did the same they have an almost identical map of the anaki underworld [Music] cosmology in the Babylonian anuma Alis Marduk assigns the Anunnaki their positions a late Babylonian version of the Epic mentions 600 Anunnaki of the underworld but only 300 Anunnaki of Heaven indicating the existence of a complex underworld cosmology in gratitude the Anunnaki the great Gods built asila a splendid Temple dedicated to Marduk EA and enil in the 8th Century BC poem of era the Anunnaki are described as the brothers of the god nargal and are depicted as antagonistic towards Humanity a badly damaged text from the Neo Assyrian period 9911 to 612 BC describes Marduk leading his army of Anunnaki in the Sacred City of nepur and causing a disturbance the disturbance causes a flood which forces the resident gods of nepur to take shelter in the eshima temple in nura and leil is enraged at marduk's transgression and orders the gods of ashuma to take Marduk and the other Anunnaki as Prisoners the Anunnaki are captured but Marduk appoints his front runner mush tesir Haim to a revolt against the gods of ashuma and send his Messenger nagil to alert Nabu the god of literacy when the ashuma gods hear nabo speak they come out of their Temple to search for him Marduk defeats the ashuma gods and takes 360 of them as prisoners of War including enil himself enil protests that the eshima gods are innocent so Marduk puts them on trial before the Anunnaki the text ends with a warning from damana another name for nag to the gods and to humanity pleading them not to repeat the war between the anunaki and the gods of ashuma when we look at the ancient hittite examples shown here in a relief carving from yazilikaya a sanctuary in husa they depicted 12 gods of the underworld whom the Hittites identified as the Mesopotamian Anunnaki in the mythologies of the hurrians and the Hittites which flourished in the mid to late 2nd millennium BC the oldest generation of gods was believed to have been banished by the younger gods to the underworld where they were ruled by the goddess lewani hittite scribes identified these deities with the Anunnaki in ancient hurrian the anunaki are referred to as kules Saun which means former ancient gods or ceris cun which means gods of the earth hittite and hurrian treaties were often been sworn by the old gods to ensure that the Oaths would be kept in one myth the gods are threatened by the Stone Giant ilumi so EA the later name for eni commands the former Gods to find the weapon that was used to separate the heavens from Earth they find it and use it to cut off ilium's feet although the names of the anunaki in hurrian and hitte text frequently vary they are always eight in number in one hittite ritual the names of the old gods are listed as adari the diver Zuli the dream interprets Ira lord of the earth Nara namsara minki amuni and API the old gods had no identifiable cult in the hrio hittite religion instead the hurrians and Hittites sought to communicate with the old gods through the ritual sacrifice of a piglet in a pit dug in the ground the old gods were often invoked to perform ritual purifications the hittite account of the old God's banishment to the underworld ultimately became the source for the Greek poet hess's Narrative of the overthrow of the Titans by the Olympians in his theogony the Greek Sky God oranos whose name means Heaven is the father of the Titans and is derived from the hittite version of Anu in hessen's account oranos is castrated by his son Kronos just as Anu was castrated by his son kumarbi in the hittite story over time because of the scientific knowledge technological and spiritual wisdom and often alleged extra sensory abilities they came to be thought of as Gods Sons and Daughters of the Gods by the less developed people who lived peacefully beside them these shining ones were said repeatedly to have civilized humankind perhaps following a global catastrophe most mainstream historians do not take seriously either the existence of this mysterious Godlike culture or the global catastrophe even though many individual researchers have concluded otherwise these shining ones also embraced a rebel group known in Legend as the Fallen ones Fallen Angels or Watchers who are recorded as having married and reproduced outside their own kind their hybrid Offspring being known as Nephilim and described as Giants The Story Goes that the catastrophe that nearly wiped out Humanity as a great Deluge due to the wrath of God or rather the wrath of Elohim or shining ones who somehow initiated it to destroy the rebels and their hybrid Offspring although fleeting references to The Shining ones can be found in the Old Testament there's much more about them in the Book of Enoch an ancient work that was omitted from the Bible The Shining ones were held in such Awe by later generations that they were revered as deities and linked with the Heavens they appear independently in many mythologies of Europe notably Irish Finnish Norse and Greek over Millennia The Shining ones or at least knowledge of them turned into brotherhoods or priesthoods well versed in the propaganda skills needed to maintain both religious and political Authority many of the world's Unexplained Mysteries in ancient cultures point to The Shining ones not just Mesopotamia revolving around the core belief of their advanced scientific and metaphysical [Music] [Music] knowledge [Music] [Music] [Music] for
