"The Sumerians were not just a civilization;\u00a0\nthey were a beacon of progress that shone\u00a0\u00a0 brightly against the backdrop of history. They\u00a0\nwere pioneers who dared to dream, to question,\u00a0\u00a0 and to explore. They looked at the world\u00a0\naround them and saw not just what was,\u00a0\u00a0 but what could be. They were the first to\u00a0\nask the questions that would define humanity:\u00a0\u00a0 Who are we? Where do we come\u00a0\nfrom? What is our purpose?\u00a0 The Sumerians were the first to develop\u00a0\na system of writing, the cuneiform,\u00a0\u00a0 etching their stories, laws, and knowledge into\u00a0\nclay tablets that have survived trough millennia.\u00a0\u00a0 They were the first to establish schools, passing\u00a0\non their knowledge from generation to generation,\u00a0\u00a0 ensuring that their wisdom would\u00a0\nnot be lost to the sands of time.\u00a0\u00a0 They were the first to codify laws,\u00a0\nto map the stars, to invent the wheel.\u00a0\u00a0 In every aspect of life, the\u00a0\nSumerians were true innovators.\u00a0 But the Sumerians were not just about innovation.\u00a0\nThey were a people of deep spirituality and\u00a0\u00a0 profound wisdom. Their pantheon of gods and\u00a0\ngoddesses, their myths and legends, their rituals\u00a0\u00a0 and ceremonies were all reflections of their\u00a0\nunderstanding of the world and their place in it.\u00a0\u00a0 They saw the divine in everything, from the\u00a0\nrising of the sun to the changing of the seasons,\u00a0\u00a0 and their religion was a testament to their\u00a0\nawe and reverence for the world around them.\u00a0 The Sumerians were also a people of great\u00a0\ncultural richness. Their art, music,\u00a0\u00a0 literature, and architecture were all expressions\u00a0\nof their creativity and their passion for beauty.\u00a0\u00a0 From the epic of Gilgamesh, one of the oldest\u00a0\nknown works of literature, to the ziggurats,\u00a0\u00a0 towering structures that reached for the heavens,\u00a0\u00a0 the Sumerians left a cultural legacy that\u00a0\ncontinues to inspire and captivate to this day.\u00a0 But who were the Sumerians? It is said that the\u00a0\nSumerians were the first civilization in human\u00a0\u00a0 history. And... It is said that the Sumerian\u00a0\ncivilization had been created by the Anunnaki,\u00a0\u00a0 a group of deities who came from the\u00a0\nheavens and taught them everything\u00a0\u00a0 to build an entire civilization that\u00a0\nstill resonates in our modern societies. To understand who the Anunnaki are, we must\u00a0\ndelve deep into who the Sumerians were. This video contains valuable information from\u00a0\nhistorical sources, and its purpose is to provide\u00a0\u00a0 you with a fundamental basis to understand the\u00a0\npillars upon which our society has developed. This is a story of innovation, resilience,\u00a0\nand a relentless pursuit of knowledge.\u00a0\u00a0 This is the story of Sumeria,\u00a0\nthe cradle of civilization.\u00a0 The origins of the Sumerians are\u00a0\nshrouded in mystery, their history\u00a0\u00a0 etched in the sands of time. Who\u00a0\nwere these people, these pioneers\u00a0\u00a0 of civilization? Where did they come\u00a0\nfrom? How did they build such a complex\u00a0\u00a0 and advanced society in a time when most of\u00a0\nthe world was still in the Stone Age? These\u00a0\u00a0 are the questions that have intrigued\u00a0\nhistorians and archaeologists for centuries.\u00a0 And this questions will be answered\u00a0\nthroughout this documentary\u2026 The Sumerians were a non-Semitic people who\u00a0\nspoke a language isolate, a language unrelated\u00a0\u00a0 to any other known language. This has made it\u00a0\ndifficult for historians to trace their origins.\u00a0\u00a0 Some theories suggest that they migrated from the\u00a0\neast, possibly from the region of modern-day Iran.\u00a0\u00a0 Others propose that they were indigenous to the\u00a0\nregion, evolving from the local Ubaid culture.\u00a0 The Ubaid period, which predates the Sumerians,\u00a0\nwas characterized by large village settlements,\u00a0\u00a0 the development of pottery, and advancements\u00a0\nin farming. It was a time of significant\u00a0\u00a0 social and economic change, setting the\u00a0\nstage for the rise of the Sumerians.\u00a0 The Ubaid period, which lasted\u00a0\nfrom about 6500 to 3800 BCE,\u00a0\u00a0 was characterized by significant\u00a0\nadvancements in various aspects of society.\u00a0\u00a0 The people of this time were primarily farmers,\u00a0\ntaking advantage of the fertile lands between\u00a0\u00a0 the Tigris and Euphrates rivers. They cultivated\u00a0\nwheat and barley, raised livestock, and developed\u00a0\u00a0 irrigation systems, demonstrating an understanding\u00a0\nof agriculture that was advanced for its time.\u00a0 But the Ubaid people were not just farmers. They\u00a0\nwere also skilled craftsmen, creating pottery that\u00a0\u00a0 was distinct in its design and craftsmanship.\u00a0\nThe pottery of this period was characterized by\u00a0\u00a0 its fine quality and intricate designs, often\u00a0\ndepicting scenes from daily life. This pottery\u00a0\u00a0 provides us with a glimpse into the lives of the\u00a0\nUbaid people, their beliefs, and their culture.\u00a0 The Ubaid period also saw the\u00a0\ndevelopment of large village settlements.\u00a0\u00a0 These settlements were characterized by\u00a0\ntheir unique architecture, including large,\u00a0\u00a0 multi-roomed houses made of mud brick. The\u00a0\nlargest of these settlements was Eridu,\u00a0\u00a0 which is considered by many to be the first\u00a0\ncity in the world. Eridu was a major center\u00a0\u00a0 of the Ubaid culture, and it was here that\u00a0\nwe see the first signs of urbanization.\u00a0 The social structure of the Ubaid culture\u00a0\nwas complex, with clear indications of social\u00a0\u00a0 stratification. The society was divided\u00a0\ninto various classes, including priests,\u00a0\u00a0 officials, craftsmen, farmers, and slaves.\u00a0\nThis social structure is indicative of a\u00a0\u00a0 society that was organized and hierarchical, a\u00a0\nsociety that was on the cusp of civilization.\u00a0 After the Ubaid period we arrive at a pivotal\u00a0\nmoment in the story of Sumer - the Uruk period.\u00a0\u00a0 Named after the ancient city of Uruk, this period,\u00a0\nwhich lasted from around 4000 to 3100 BCE, was a\u00a0\u00a0 time of profound transformation and growth. It was\u00a0\nduring this time that the Sumerian civilization\u00a0\u00a0 truly began to take shape, laying the groundwork\u00a0\nfor the world's first known civilization.\u00a0 The Uruk period was characterized by\u00a0\nsignificant advancements in technology,\u00a0\u00a0 the development of writing, and the\u00a0\nestablishment of political structures.\u00a0\u00a0 These advancements were driven by a rapidly\u00a0\ngrowing population, which led to increased social\u00a0\u00a0 complexity and the need for more efficient\u00a0\nmethods of communication and governance. One of the most significant advancements of the\u00a0\nUruk period was the development of writing. The\u00a0\u00a0 Sumerians were the first to develop a system\u00a0\nof writing, known as cuneiform. This system,\u00a0\u00a0 which began as a series of pictographs, evolved\u00a0\nover time into a complex system of wedge-shaped\u00a0\u00a0 marks made on clay tablets. This development\u00a0\nmarked a major milestone in human history,\u00a0\u00a0 as it allowed for the recording of history, laws,\u00a0\nand administrative records, paving the way for\u00a0\u00a0 the complex societies of later civilizations.\nThe Uruk period also saw the establishment of\u00a0\u00a0 political structures. The growing complexity of\u00a0\nSumerian society necessitated the development\u00a0\u00a0 of a system of governance. The Sumerians\u00a0\nestablished city-states, each governed by a lugal,\u00a0\u00a0 or king. These city-states were independent\u00a0\npolitical entities, each with its own government\u00a0\u00a0 and ruler. This political structure provided\u00a0\na framework for the organization of society\u00a0\u00a0 and the administration of public affairs.\nThe city of Uruk, from which this period\u00a0\u00a0 takes its name, was a major center of the Sumerian\u00a0\ncivilization. It was one of the largest cities in\u00a0\u00a0 the world at the time, with a population of up\u00a0\nto 80,000 people. The city was a hub of trade,\u00a0\u00a0 religion, and politics, and its influence\u00a0\nextended far beyond its own borders.\u00a0 After the period of Uruk, the Sumerian\u00a0\ncivilization reach the Early Dynastic\u00a0\u00a0 Period, a time when the Sumerian\u00a0\ncivilization reached its zenith.\u00a0\u00a0 Lasting from around 2900 to 2350 BCE, this period\u00a0\nwas characterized by the rise of city-states,\u00a0\u00a0 the development of art and literature, and\u00a0\nthe establishment of the first known empire.\u00a0 The Early Dynastic Period saw the emergence of\u00a0\npowerful city-states, each governed by a lugal,\u00a0\u00a0 or king. These city-states, including Eridu,\u00a0\nUruk, Ur, and Lagash, were independent political\u00a0\u00a0 entities, each with its own government\u00a0\nand ruler. They were centers of trade,\u00a0\u00a0 religion, and politics, their influence\u00a0\nextending far beyond their own borders.\u00a0 The city-states were often at war with each other,\u00a0\nvying for control of resources and territory.\u00a0\u00a0 These conflicts led to the rise of powerful\u00a0\nkings, who established the first known empires.\u00a0\u00a0 The most famous of these was the Akkadian\u00a0\nEmpire, established by Sargon of Akkad,\u00a0\u00a0 who is considered one of the world's\u00a0\nfirst great military leaders.\u00a0 The Early Dynastic Period was also a time of\u00a0\ncultural flourishing. The Sumerians developed\u00a0\u00a0 a rich body of literature, including the Epic\u00a0\nof Gilgamesh, one of the oldest known works\u00a0\u00a0 of literature. This epic poem, which tells the\u00a0\nstory of the hero Gilgamesh and his quest for\u00a0\u00a0 immortality, provides a glimpse into the beliefs,\u00a0\nvalues, and struggles of the Sumerian people.\u00a0 Art also flourished during this period,\u00a0\nwith the creation of intricate sculptures,\u00a0\u00a0 reliefs, and pottery. The Sumerians were skilled\u00a0\ncraftsmen, and their art was characterized by its\u00a0\u00a0 attention to detail, its realism, and its symbolic\u00a0\nimagery. These works of art provide a window into\u00a0\u00a0 the world of the Sumerians, revealing their\u00a0\nbeliefs, their values, and their way of life.\u00a0 The Sumerians were not just pioneers\u00a0\nof civilization; they were visionaries,\u00a0\u00a0 their minds teeming with ideas that\u00a0\nwere far ahead of their time. From\u00a0\u00a0 their understanding of time to their\u00a0\nestablishment of the first schools,\u00a0\u00a0 the Sumerians were true innovators,\u00a0\ntheir legacy echoing through the ages. One of the most significant Sumerian innovations\u00a0\nwas their development of the concept of time.\u00a0\u00a0 While most ancient civilizations based their\u00a0\nconcept of time on the movements of the sun\u00a0\u00a0 and moon, the Sumerians took a different\u00a0\napproach. They divided the day into 24 hours,\u00a0\u00a0 the hour into 60 minutes, and the minute\u00a0\ninto 60 seconds. This sexagesimal system,\u00a0\u00a0 based on the number 60, is still in use today, a\u00a0\ntestament to the enduring legacy of the Sumerians.\u00a0 The Sumerians were also the first to\u00a0\nestablish schools, known as edubba,\u00a0\u00a0 or tablet houses. These schools were\u00a0\nprimarily for boys from wealthy families,\u00a0\u00a0 who were taught to read and write cuneiform,\u00a0\nas well as mathematics, history, and law. The\u00a0\u00a0 edubba were more than just places of learning;\u00a0\nthey were the breeding ground for the scribes,\u00a0\u00a0 officials, and priests who would go on to\u00a0\nplay a crucial role in Sumerian society.\u00a0 Another significant Sumerian innovation was the\u00a0\ndevelopment of the wheel. While the exact origin\u00a0\u00a0 of the wheel is unknown, the oldest known\u00a0\nwheel was found in Mesopotamia and dates\u00a0\u00a0 back to around 3500 BCE. The Sumerians used\u00a0\nthe wheel for transportation, pottery making,\u00a0\u00a0 and even for irrigation, demonstrating their\u00a0\nability to adapt and innovate. This not only\u00a0\u00a0 revolutionized transport but also led to the\u00a0\ncreation of one of the most powerful weapons\u00a0\u00a0 of ancient times: the chariot. The wheel\u00a0\nset the stage for the creation of chariots,\u00a0\u00a0 which would later become a symbol of power\u00a0\nand status in many ancient civilization.\u00a0 The Sumerians were also skilled engineers,\u00a0\ndeveloping complex irrigation systems to water\u00a0\u00a0 their crops. These systems, which included canals,\u00a0\ndikes, and reservoirs, allowed the Sumerians to\u00a0\u00a0 transform the arid landscape of Mesopotamia\u00a0\ninto a fertile agricultural hub. This ability\u00a0\u00a0 to manipulate their environment was a key factor\u00a0\nin the success of the Sumerian civilization.\u00a0 As we explore the many innovations of the\u00a0\nSumerians, we see a civilization that was not\u00a0\u00a0 just advanced for its time, but one that\u00a0\ncontinues to influence our world today.\u00a0\u00a0 The Sumerians were visionaries, their ideas and\u00a0\ninventions shaping the course of human history.\u00a0 Now let\u2019s turn our attention to analyze one\u00a0\nspecific development that we already cite earlier:\u00a0\u00a0 the Sumerian system of writing, the cuneiform.\u00a0\nWe will explore its origins, its development,\u00a0\u00a0 and its significance, revealing how this\u00a0\nancient system of writing has shaped our\u00a0\u00a0 understanding of the Sumerian civilization\u00a0\nand the world of the ancient Near East.\u00a0 This ancient script, etched into clay\u00a0\ntablets, has provided us with a window\u00a0\u00a0 into the world of the Sumerians, revealing their\u00a0\nbeliefs, their values, and their way of life.\u00a0 Cuneiform, which means \"wedge-shaped\" in\u00a0\nLatin, began as a series of pictographs,\u00a0\u00a0 or picture symbols, around 3200 BCE. These\u00a0\nearly pictographs were simple and direct,\u00a0\u00a0 representing objects or concepts. However,\u00a0\nas the Sumerian society grew more complex,\u00a0\u00a0 so did their system of writing. The pictographs\u00a0\nevolved into a series of wedge-shaped marks,\u00a0\u00a0 which could represent not just objects, but also\u00a0\nabstract ideas, sounds, and grammatical elements.\u00a0 The development of cuneiform was a\u00a0\nrevolutionary moment in human history.\u00a0\u00a0 For the first time, humans could record their\u00a0\nthoughts, their laws, their transactions,\u00a0\u00a0 and their history. They could communicate across\u00a0\ntime and space, preserving their knowledge for\u00a0\u00a0 future generations. This was a major step towards\u00a0\nthe complex societies of later civilizations.\u00a0 Learning to read and write cuneiform was a\u00a0\ndifficult task, requiring years of study.\u00a0\u00a0 This task was undertaken by a special class\u00a0\nof scribes, who were highly respected in\u00a0\u00a0 Sumerian society. These scribes were not\u00a0\njust writers; they were also teachers,\u00a0\u00a0 judges, and officials, playing a crucial role\u00a0\nin the administration of the city-states. The cuneiform tablets that have survived to\u00a0\nthis day provide us with a wealth of information\u00a0\u00a0 about the Sumerians. They contain economic\u00a0\nrecords, laws, hymns, prayers, magic spells,\u00a0\u00a0 and even works of literature. These tablets are\u00a0\na testament to the richness and complexity of\u00a0\u00a0 Sumerian society, revealing a civilization\u00a0\nthat was remarkably advanced for its time.\u00a0 As we can observe the sumerian civilization was\u00a0\nnot just innovative, but also deeply thoughtful.\u00a0\u00a0 The Sumerians were not just inventors; they\u00a0\nwere also philosophers, poets, and scholars,\u00a0\u00a0 their ideas and beliefs etched into the clay\u00a0\ntablets that have survived the ravages of time.\u00a0 The Sumerians were deeply religious, their\u00a0\nlives intertwined with their devotion to\u00a0\u00a0 a pantheon of gods and goddesses.\u00a0\nThese deities were called Anunnaki.\u00a0\u00a0 Each Anunnaki had their own personalities,\u00a0\ndomains, and stories, were the heart of\u00a0\u00a0 Sumerian religion, influencing\u00a0\nevery aspect of their society.\u00a0 At the apex of the Sumerian pantheon was An, the\u00a0\nsky god, and Enlil, the god of wind and storms.\u00a0\u00a0 These deities were seen as the supreme\u00a0\nrulers of the gods, their will shaping\u00a0\u00a0 the destiny of both gods and mortals. Beneath\u00a0\nthem were a host of other gods and goddesses,\u00a0\u00a0 each responsible for different aspects\u00a0\nof the natural world and human life.\u00a0 Among these deities were Enki, the god of water\u00a0\nand wisdom, Inanna, the goddess of love and war,\u00a0\u00a0 Utu-, the sun god, and Nanna, the moon\u00a0\ngod. Each of these deities had their\u00a0\u00a0 own temples and priesthoods, their worship\u00a0\nforming a central part of Sumerian life.\u00a0 The Sumerians believed that their gods were\u00a0\nintimately involved in their lives. They saw\u00a0\u00a0 the hand of the gods in the changing of\u00a0\nthe seasons, the success of their crops,\u00a0\u00a0 and the outcomes of their wars. They believed that\u00a0\nby honoring the gods through rituals, sacrifices,\u00a0\u00a0 and hymns, they could gain their favor and\u00a0\nensure the prosperity of their city-states.\u00a0 The myths and legends of the Sumerians reveal a\u00a0\nrich and complex cosmology. From the creation of\u00a0\u00a0 the world to the epic adventures of their gods,\u00a0\nthese stories were more than just entertainment.\u00a0\u00a0 They were a way for the Sumerians to make sense of\u00a0\nthe world around them, to explain the mysteries of\u00a0\u00a0 nature, and to explore the human condition.\nTaking into consideration that the deities\u00a0\u00a0 revered by the Sumerians, and later\u00a0\nby the Akkadians and Assyrians,\u00a0\u00a0 are the main subject of study on this channel, we\u00a0\nwill delve deeper into their examination once we\u00a0\u00a0 have sufficiently studied the entire history and\u00a0\ndevelopment of the Sumerian civilization. For now,\u00a0\u00a0 let us closely observe the art and architecture\u00a0\nthat emerged within the Sumerian civilization.\u00a0 The Sumerians were skilled craftsmen and\u00a0\ninnovative architects, their creative\u00a0\u00a0 endeavors providing us with a glimpse into their\u00a0\nbeliefs, their values, and their understanding of\u00a0\u00a0 the world. Sumerian art was characterized\u00a0\nby its attention to detail, its realism,\u00a0\u00a0 and its symbolic imagery. The Sumerians created\u00a0\nintricate sculptures, reliefs, and pottery,\u00a0\u00a0 their works often depicting scenes from daily\u00a0\nlife, religious rituals, and mythological tales.\u00a0\u00a0 These works of art were not just decorative;\u00a0\u00a0 they were a means of expressing the Sumerians'\u00a0\nbeliefs and values, their hopes and fears. One of the most famous examples of\u00a0\nSumerian art is the Standard of Ur,\u00a0\u00a0 a wooden box inlaid with shells\u00a0\nand lapis lazuli. This artifact,\u00a0\u00a0 which dates back to around 2600 BCE,\u00a0\ndepicts scenes of war and peace,\u00a0\u00a0 revealing the Sumerians' understanding\u00a0\nof the dual nature of human existence.\u00a0 Sumerian architecture was equally impressive,\u00a0\ncharacterized by its grand scale and its\u00a0\u00a0 functional design. The Sumerians were the first\u00a0\nto build ziggurats, stepped pyramids that served\u00a0\u00a0 as temples to the gods. These structures, which\u00a0\nwere often the tallest buildings in the city,\u00a0\u00a0 were a testament to the Sumerians' architectural\u00a0\nprowess and their deep reverence for the divine.\u00a0 The city of Uruk, in particular, was\u00a0\nknown for its architectural marvels.\u00a0\u00a0 The city was home to the Eanna district, a\u00a0\ncomplex of temples and ziggurats dedicated\u00a0\u00a0 to the goddess Inanna. The largest of\u00a0\nthese structures, the White Temple,\u00a0\u00a0 was a marvel of ancient architecture, its\u00a0\nwhitewashed walls gleaming in the sun.\u00a0 Now we turn our gaze to the Sumerian\u00a0\nlegal system, a cornerstone of their\u00a0\u00a0 society. The Sumerians were one of the first\u00a0\ncivilizations to develop a comprehensive\u00a0\u00a0 legal system, and their laws provided the\u00a0\nframework for social order and justice.\u00a0 The Sumerian legal system\u00a0\nwas based on the principle\u00a0\u00a0 of \"an eye for an eye\". Does it sound familiar?\nThis principle, known as lex talionis, stipulated\u00a0\u00a0 that the punishment for a crime should be equal to\u00a0\nthe harm caused by the crime. While this may seem\u00a0\u00a0 harsh by modern standards, it was a significant\u00a0\nstep towards the concept of proportional justice,\u00a0\u00a0 the idea that the punishment should fit the crime.\nThe Sumerian laws covered a wide range of issues,\u00a0\u00a0 from property rights and trade\u00a0\nregulations to marriage and divorce.\u00a0\u00a0 These laws were not just rules; they were a\u00a0\nreflection of the Sumerians' values and beliefs,\u00a0\u00a0 their understanding of justice and fairness.\nOne of the most famous examples of Sumerian law is\u00a0\u00a0 the Code of Ur-Nammu, the oldest known law code.\u00a0\nThis code, which dates back to around 2100 BCE,\u00a0\u00a0 contains laws on a variety of issues,\u00a0\nincluding theft, murder, and adultery.\u00a0\u00a0 The code is notable for its emphasis on justice\u00a0\nand the rights of the individual, principles that\u00a0\u00a0 are still central to our legal systems today.\nThe enforcement of these laws was the\u00a0\u00a0 responsibility of the lugal, or\u00a0\nking, and the ensi, or city ruler.\u00a0\u00a0 These rulers were seen as the representatives\u00a0\nof the gods, their authority derived from\u00a0\u00a0 their divine mandate. They were responsible\u00a0\nfor maintaining order, resolving disputes,\u00a0\u00a0 and ensuring the welfare of their people.\nAs we delve into the world of Sumerian law,\u00a0\u00a0 we see a civilization that was not just\u00a0\nadvanced, but also deeply thoughtful.\u00a0\u00a0 The Sumerians were not just rulers and lawmakers;\u00a0\nthey were also philosophers and moralists,\u00a0\u00a0 their laws reflecting their understanding\u00a0\nof justice and the human condition.\u00a0 Now let\u2019s take a look on Sumerian economy.\u00a0\nAs you can imagine, the sumerians was also\u00a0\u00a0 the first economy of the world. It was\u00a0\na complex system of resource management,\u00a0\u00a0 trade, and labor that sustained their\u00a0\nsociety and fueled their prosperity. The Sumerian economy was primarily agrarian, based\u00a0\non the cultivation of crops such as barley, wheat,\u00a0\u00a0 and flax, and the rearing of livestock.\u00a0\nThe fertile plains of Mesopotamia,\u00a0\u00a0 irrigated by the Tigris and Euphrates rivers,\u00a0\nprovided the Sumerians with abundant resources,\u00a0\u00a0 enabling them to support a large population\u00a0\nand build prosperous city-states.\u00a0 The Sumerians, however, were not only farmers\u00a0\nbut also skilled craftsmen, as we have already\u00a0\u00a0 noted, who produced a wide range of goods,\u00a0\nincluding pottery, textiles, and metalwork.\u00a0\u00a0 These goods were not only for local consumption,\u00a0\u00a0 but were also traded with neighboring\u00a0\nregions, making the Sumerians one of the first\u00a0\u00a0 civilizations to engage in long-distance trade.\nTrade was a vital part of the Sumerian economy,\u00a0\u00a0 providing them with goods and resources\u00a0\nthat were not available locally.\u00a0\u00a0 The Sumerians traded with regions as far away\u00a0\nas the Indus Valley and Egypt, exchanging\u00a0\u00a0 their surplus goods for precious materials\u00a0\nsuch as lapis lazuli, gold, and cedar wood.\u00a0 The Sumerians were also pioneers in the\u00a0\ndevelopment of economic institutions.\u00a0\u00a0 They established complex systems of credit and\u00a0\ndebt, with loans being recorded on clay tablets.\u00a0\u00a0 They also developed a system of weights and\u00a0\nmeasures, which facilitated trade and commerce.\u00a0 In this regard, temples played a crucial role in\u00a0\nthe Sumerian economy. They were not just places of\u00a0\u00a0 worship; they were also economic hubs, owning vast\u00a0\ntracts of land and employing a large workforce.\u00a0\u00a0 The temples acted as banks, lending grain\u00a0\nto farmers and collecting interest on loans.\u00a0\u00a0 They also acted as warehouses, storing surplus\u00a0\ngoods and redistributing them to the populace.\u00a0 The economic role of the temple in Sumerian\u00a0\nsociety cannot be overstated. The temples\u00a0\u00a0 owned vast tracts of land, which were worked by\u00a0\ntemple dependents and slaves. The produce from\u00a0\u00a0 these lands, as well as the offerings made by the\u00a0\npeople, were stored in the temple's granaries and\u00a0\u00a0 warehouses. These goods were then redistributed\u00a0\nto the populace, particularly to those in need.\u00a0\u00a0 In this way, the temple served as a kind of\u00a0\nwelfare state, ensuring that no one went hungry.\u00a0 These grand structures, dedicated to the various\u00a0\ngods and goddesses of the Sumerian pantheon,\u00a0\u00a0 were more than just places of worship. They were\u00a0\nthe beating heart of the city-states, serving as\u00a0\u00a0 centers of economic, political, and social life.\nThe temples of Sumer were grand edifices, their\u00a0\u00a0 towering ziggurats reaching towards the heavens.\u00a0\nThese stepped pyramids, which were believed to be\u00a0\u00a0 the dwelling places of the gods, were a testament\u00a0\nto the Sumerians' architectural prowess and their\u00a0\u00a0 deep reverence for the divine. Each city-state\u00a0\nhad its own temple, dedicated to its patron deity.\u00a0\u00a0 These temples were often the largest and\u00a0\nmost prominent structures in the city,\u00a0\u00a0 their presence a constant reminder of the\u00a0\ndivine authority that governed Sumerian life.\u00a0 Politically, the temples held immense power.\u00a0\nThe ensi, or city ruler, was often the high\u00a0\u00a0 priest of the city's temple, his authority\u00a0\nderived from his role as the representative\u00a0\u00a0 of the city's patron deity. The ensi was\u00a0\nresponsible for maintaining the temple,\u00a0\u00a0 performing the necessary rituals, and ensuring\u00a0\nthe favor of the gods. In return, the ensi was\u00a0\u00a0 granted the authority to govern the city-state,\u00a0\nhis rule seen as an extension of divine will.\u00a0 Socially, the temple was a hub of activity. It\u00a0\nwas a place of gathering, where people came to\u00a0\u00a0 worship, to celebrate festivals, and to conduct\u00a0\nbusiness. The temple was also a place of learning,\u00a0\u00a0 where scribes were trained and where knowledge\u00a0\nwas preserved and passed down through generations.\u00a0 As we can observe, since we started this video,\u00a0\nthe Sumerians developed various different areas\u00a0\u00a0 to facilitate the progress of their society.\u00a0\nThey were pioneers in multiple fields. Up to this point, we have observed\u00a0\nthe achievements of the Sumerians,\u00a0\u00a0 who thrived in the region of the Fertile Crescent,\u00a0\nspecifically in the area between the Tigris and\u00a0\u00a0 Euphrates rivers in Mesopotamia, through the\u00a0\nlens of science, archaeology, and historiography.\u00a0\u00a0 However, the purpose of this channel and\u00a0\nthis video is to go beyond what historians\u00a0\u00a0 and archaeologists can assert about\u00a0\nSumerian civilization. This is because\u00a0\u00a0 we will continue to examine history and\u00a0\nphilosophy, at the boundaries of science,\u00a0\u00a0 in order to observe different nuances in\u00a0\nthe formation of the world and our society. In the Sumerian tablets, the Sumerians\u00a0\nexplicitly and clearly described the\u00a0\u00a0 origin of the knowledge that enabled the\u00a0\ndevelopment of civilization as we know it.\u00a0\u00a0 If we could go back in time and ask\u00a0\nany inhabitant of one of the Sumerian\u00a0\u00a0 city-states about their creators,\u00a0\nthey would all point to the heavens. According to the Sumerian tablets, properly\u00a0\nregistered in Sumerian mythology, before\u00a0\u00a0 the existence of humans, the Earth was inhabited\u00a0\nsolely by gods and goddesses. These divine beings\u00a0\u00a0 were the original laborers, tilling the land and\u00a0\nperforming other tasks. Some myths classify those\u00a0\u00a0 gods and goddesses into two different groups: the\u00a0\nmajor gods known as Anunnaki and the junior gods\u00a0\u00a0 known as Igigi. The gods who performed the tasks\u00a0\nwere the junior or minor gods, known as Igigi.\u00a0\u00a0 However, in some myths, it becomes clear that the\u00a0\ngods and goddesses were tired of the hard work...\u00a0\u00a0 In response to this divine fatigue,\u00a0\nhumans were created. The purpose of\u00a0\u00a0 their creation? To serve the gods, to take over\u00a0\nthe labor that the gods found too burdensome. At this point, it is good to observe that\u00a0\nthe Sumerians referred to themselves as the\u00a0\u00a0 \"black-headed people.\" The term \u201cSumerians\u201d\u00a0\nis a term that was not a self-designation\u00a0\u00a0 but one given to them by other civilizations\u00a0\nin later times, such as the Akkadian empire.\u00a0\u00a0 The term \"Sumerian\" itself was not used by\u00a0\nthe people we now know as the Sumerians.\u00a0\u00a0 It was a label applied by others. This term\u00a0\n\"Sumerian\" means \"land of the civilized kings.\" And this title \"Sumerians\" or the inhabitants of\u00a0\u00a0 the \"land of the civilized kings\" has\u00a0\na deep connection with their story. Before we dive into this, I have to warn you...\u00a0\nThis is the exact point of the video where we are\u00a0\u00a0 going to shift to a different point of view.\u00a0\nWe are going to abandon traditional science,\u00a0\u00a0 archaeology, philosophy, and observe the\u00a0\ncradle of civilization through another lens...\u00a0 Through this point of the video, I will ask you.\u00a0\nIf you have not watched some of the videos that\u00a0\u00a0 I previously published, such as \u201cThe Trial of\u00a0\nGod: Was He Invented? ... Judging Yahweh, the God\u00a0\u00a0 of the Bible\u201d or \u201cFrom ANUNNAKI to the BIBLICAL\u00a0\nYAHWEH! ... Tracing the Path of the Only God,\u201d I\u00a0\u00a0 will invite you to watch these\u00a0\nvideos after you finish this one...\u00a0\u00a0 because they will give you a good idea of\u00a0\nhow intertwined studies such as theological,\u00a0\u00a0 archaeological, historical, philosophical,\u00a0\nand mythological are important to\u00a0\u00a0 form a new way of viewing our past and\u00a0\nunderstanding our present and our future. Now, let\u2019s dive into this different point of view. Before we state that the word \"Sumerian\" is a\u00a0\nterm that means \"land of the civilized kings\"...\u00a0\u00a0 If we turn our attention to the meaning that\u00a0\ntraditional science gives to the term Anunnaki,\u00a0\u00a0 \"those of royal blood,\" we can already have a\u00a0\ngood idea about who these royal bloodlines are. Nevertheless, we can go much deeper than that... In the Sumerian clay tablets,\u00a0\u00a0 there is an important document\u00a0\nentitled \"The Sumerian King List.\" When looking at this title, it could\u00a0\nbe interesting to expand upon it. If\u00a0\u00a0 Sumerian means \"land of the civilized\u00a0\nkings,\" what could be contained in the\u00a0\u00a0 document \"The King List of the\u00a0\nLand of the Civilized Kings\"? Let\u2019s take a look at the first statement... It says: \"After the kingship descended from\u00a0\nheaven, the kingship was in Eridu. In Eridu,\u00a0\u00a0 Alulim became king; he ruled for 28,800 years.\" And at that point, you might\u00a0\nbe thinking, \"What...?\" Let\u2019s go back to the part of this documentary\u00a0\nwhen we were analyzing the Ubaid period,\u00a0\u00a0 the historical period that predates\u00a0\nthe Sumerian civilization... From there, using historical sources, I said: \"The Ubaid period also saw the development of\u00a0\nlarge village settlements. These settlements\u00a0\u00a0 were characterized by their unique\u00a0\narchitecture, including large,\u00a0\u00a0 multi-roomed houses made of mud bricks.\u00a0\nThe largest of these settlements was Eridu,\u00a0\u00a0 which is considered by many to be the first\u00a0\ncity in the world. Eridu was a major center\u00a0\u00a0 of the Ubaid culture, and it was here that\u00a0\nwe see the first signs of urbanization.\" By cross-referencing historical information with\u00a0\nthe insights gleaned from Mesopotamian myths,\u00a0\u00a0 we may uncover intriguing answers. This indicates\u00a0\nthat during the pre-Sumerian period, the concept\u00a0\u00a0 of kingship was believed to have originated from\u00a0\na divine source and was established in the city\u00a0\u00a0 of Eridu. Historical sources suggest that Eridu\u00a0\ncould possibly be considered the first city in\u00a0\u00a0 the world. According to these sources, Eridu\u00a0\nwas governed by a single king named Alulim for\u00a0\u00a0 a remarkable duration of 28,800 years.\nIf you find this interesting,\u00a0\u00a0 I need to ask you to keep calm\u2026\nJust see the information that comes next\u2026\u00a0 As I said in another video, I\u2019m a passionate\u00a0\nresearcher on this subject. I have been feeding\u00a0\u00a0 myself with lots of information during the last 10\u00a0\nyears. I\u2019ve been reading academic and non-academic\u00a0\u00a0 studies. And for now, we are going to delve into\u00a0\nan academic source. You can read it if you want.\u00a0\u00a0 Search on the internet for the article\u00a0\n\"The divine appointment of the first\u00a0\u00a0 antediluvian king: newly recovered\u00a0\ncontent from the Ur version of the\u00a0\u00a0 Sumerian flood story.\" This article\u00a0\nhas been written by Jeremiah Peterson,\u00a0\u00a0 an Assyriologist and specialist in\u00a0\ncuneiform languages of ancient Mesopotamia.\u00a0 In this article, Jeremiah states, \"The\u00a0\naforementioned possible literal meaning\u00a0\u00a0 'seed (of) the red deer' could be a reference to\u00a0\nthe prehistoric origins of Alulim when people were\u00a0\u00a0 understood to behave more like animals. Humans\u00a0\nof the prehistoric era are described as such most\u00a0\u00a0 explicitly in the potentially related contexts of\u00a0\n'Sheep and Grain' and 'How Grain Came to Sumer'.\"\u00a0 Jeremiah, in his article, presents one text\u00a0\nfrom the cuneiform tablets. This text states:\u00a0\u00a0 \"They, the chief deities, created humanity.\u00a0\nAfter the animals were proliferating from\u00a0\u00a0 the earth in unison, they made livestock and\u00a0\nquadrupeds as fitting things in the steppe\u2026\"\u00a0 The text continues, but it is not necessary\u00a0\nto read more in order to make connections.\u00a0\u00a0 Jeremiah elucidates that Alulim, in those\u00a0\ntexts, is most likely to be a non-human king,\u00a0\u00a0 as the texts demonstrate that during this\u00a0\nperiod there were no civilized humans on Earth.\u00a0 And, of course, we need to\u00a0\nremember that scientific sources,\u00a0\u00a0 such as historical and archaeological evidence,\u00a0\u00a0 state that civilized humans only appeared when\u00a0\nthe Sumerian civilization flourished. Before that,\u00a0\u00a0 the humanoids on Earth were hunter-gatherers\u00a0\nand nomads, and there was no civilization. When we read the Mesopotamian clay tablets,\u00a0\nfor instance, the period before the cradle\u00a0\u00a0 of civilization in Sumer was a time when only\u00a0\nthe gods walked on earth. To establish one more\u00a0\u00a0 interesting connection\u2026 Just look into this.\nIn historical sources, such as the books of\u00a0\u00a0 Samuel Noah Kramer, we can read that the Sumerians\u00a0\nbelieved that their lives were devoted to serving\u00a0\u00a0 the gods. This was not a point of contention\u00a0\nor a philosophical debate for them. They did\u00a0\u00a0 not grapple with modern dilemmas of free\u00a0\nwill versus determinism. For the Sumerians,\u00a0\u00a0 their purpose was clear and unambiguous\u00a0\n- they were created to serve the gods.\u00a0 And that's another point to observe. Historical\u00a0\nsources align with their myths when the Sumerians\u00a0\u00a0 elucidate that they were created to serve the\u00a0\ngods, to substitute the hard work of the gods.\u00a0 This belief was reflected in their\u00a0\nsocietal structures and practices.\u00a0\u00a0 Those constructions known as ziggurats\u00a0\nthat we talked about earlier,\u00a0\u00a0 these massive structures are thought to be the\u00a0\nhouses of the gods. These structures were built\u00a0\u00a0 as places of worship and as a testament to the\u00a0\nSumerians' devotion to their divine creators.\u00a0 The Sumerians' belief in their divine purpose\u00a0\nalso influenced their understanding of the natural\u00a0\u00a0 world. They saw the patterns and cycles in nature\u00a0\nas manifestations of the divine will. The heavens,\u00a0\u00a0 the earth, and the space in between - these\u00a0\nwere all elements of their cosmic understanding.\u00a0 By exploring their beliefs, we can gain a better\u00a0\nunderstanding of their thoughts about their place\u00a0\u00a0 in the universe and their interactions with\u00a0\nthe divine, as well as their spiritual beliefs.\u00a0 The Sumerians believed in an afterlife,\u00a0\na realm known as the Underworld or Kur.\u00a0\u00a0 This was not a place of punishment or\u00a0\nreward, but rather a continuation of life,\u00a0\u00a0 albeit in a shadowy, less vibrant form. The\u00a0\nUnderworld was seen as a dark, dusty place,\u00a0\u00a0 where the spirits of the dead, known as gidim\u00a0\nor ghosts in our modern language, dwelled.\u00a0 Upon death, the Sumerians believed that\u00a0\nthe gidim traveled to the Underworld,\u00a0\u00a0 crossing a river with the help of a ferryman.\u00a0\nOnce in the Underworld, the gidim lived a life\u00a0\u00a0 similar to their earthly existence, eating,\u00a0\ndrinking, and socializing with other spirits.\u00a0 However, life in the Underworld was not\u00a0\neasy. The gidim were dependent on their\u00a0\u00a0 living relatives for sustenance, relying on\u00a0\nthem to provide food and drink offerings.\u00a0\u00a0 If these offerings were not made, the\u00a0\ngidim could suffer from hunger and thirst,\u00a0\u00a0 or even return to the world of\u00a0\nthe living as restless spirits.\u00a0 The Sumerians performed elaborate burial\u00a0\nrituals to ensure the well-being of the gidim.\u00a0\u00a0 These rituals included the provision\u00a0\nof grave goods, such as food, drink,\u00a0\u00a0 and personal belongings, to accompany the\u00a0\ndeceased in the afterlife. The Sumerians\u00a0\u00a0 also held regular feasts for the dead, during\u00a0\nwhich they made offerings to their ancestors.\u00a0 The Sumerian beliefs about the afterlife\u00a0\nreveal a civilization that was deeply aware\u00a0\u00a0 of the fragility of life and the inevitability\u00a0\nof death. They saw death not as an end, but as\u00a0\u00a0 a transition to a different state of existence.\u00a0\nTheir rituals and beliefs reflected their desire\u00a0\u00a0 to maintain a connection with their ancestors\u00a0\nand ensure their well-being in the afterlife.\u00a0 I would like to conclude this\u00a0\ndocumentary by clarifying that\u00a0\u00a0 this subject is extremely vast... and just as\u00a0\nit is vast, it is also incredibly fascinating.\u00a0\u00a0 I know that this is not the only channel\u00a0\ndiscussing this topic, and I also know that,\u00a0\u00a0 like me, most people who come across this\u00a0\nvideo and this channel have already read\u00a0\u00a0 and researched extensively on this subject.\nI, Lucas, the name behind this channel, the name\u00a0\u00a0 behind the studies and the texts, would like to\u00a0\nexpress my deep gratitude to you for being here.\u00a0\u00a0 Without you, I could never be sharing\u00a0\nthis kind of content. Furthermore,\u00a0\u00a0 I want you to know the three main reasons\u00a0\nwhy this subject is extremely intriguing...\u00a0 1 - Because this subject is relatively\u00a0\nrecent in our history, considering that\u00a0\u00a0 the Mesopotamian tablets were discovered\u00a0\nin the second half of the 19th century.\u00a0 2 - Because these gods revered by the first\u00a0\ncivilization in human history, the Anunnaki,\u00a0\u00a0 bear incredible similarities to all the\u00a0\nother gods in mythologies around the planet.\u00a0\u00a0 And in this case, we might be referring, in all\u00a0\nmythologies, to the same entities, the Anunnaki.\u00a0 3 - And this is the most important reason! The\u00a0\nstudy of the Anunnaki represents the ultimate\u00a0\u00a0 frontier between traditional science, archaeology,\u00a0\nhistory, philosophy, pseudoscience, theology,\u00a0\u00a0 and science fiction... The renowned author\u00a0\nZecharia Sitchin has faced extensive criticism,\u00a0\u00a0 accused of inserting information into the\u00a0\ntablets where it could not be found. However,\u00a0\u00a0 the more I read and investigate this subject, even\u00a0\nin academic sources, the more I notice that many\u00a0\u00a0 of Sitchin's claims seem to be true... Although\u00a0\nI must make it clear, crystal clear... I do not\u00a0\u00a0 endorse Sitchin's work as the ultimate frontier of\u00a0\ntruth, just as I do not do so for any religious or\u00a0\u00a0 historical perspective. I believe, deep within\u00a0\nmy being, that we should study various religious\u00a0\u00a0 paths, academic perspectives, religious thoughts,\u00a0\nphilosophies, and mythologies in search of truth.\u00a0\u00a0 I also believe that each person can find their\u00a0\nown truth, and these truths can be different,\u00a0\u00a0 coexisting on this planet without the need\u00a0\nfor us to wage war against one another.\u00a0 However, in this regard, I must remind you! The\u00a0\ndiscovery of the Sumerian tablets is recent in\u00a0\u00a0 our history. It is a delicate, captivating, and\u00a0\nprofoundly revolutionary subject, and it holds\u00a0\u00a0 great importance. The story of the Anunnaki as\u00a0\ndescribed by Sitchin in his studies, and in the\u00a0\u00a0 Lost Book of Enki, is incredibly important\u00a0\nto be studied, analyzed, known, and shared.\u00a0\u00a0 This is the main reason why the Anunnaki\u00a0\nmovies exist here on this channel...\u00a0\u00a0 Furthermore, Zecharia Sitchin did not translate\u00a0\nthe tablets himself; he merely made use of\u00a0\u00a0 translations already established by some experts,\u00a0\nalthough he was capable of reading the tablets and\u00a0\u00a0 understanding them. Therefore, it is essential to\u00a0\nconsider his theory, research, and discoveries.\u00a0 By carefully observing Sitchin's theory,\u00a0\u00a0 we can grasp many mysteries that surround our\u00a0\nexistence... There is much more to be said,\u00a0\u00a0 studied, and shown about this subject,\u00a0\nand it will be\u2026 in future videos!\u00a0 Thank you for watching.\nRemember to like the video, comment,\u00a0\u00a0 and share it with your friends and family.\nI'll see you in the next video!
