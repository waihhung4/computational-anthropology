"hello everyone welcome or welcome back to my channel my name is Olivia and I make videos about anthropology every single Sunday and today we are diving into the highly controversial new Netflix show ancient Apocalypse Now it's been a little while since I have done a video on archeology and so this show has come at the perfect time now my boyfriend and I started watching this show not too long ago and it got to the point where I was literally taking notes on my phone so I remembered things that I wanted to talk about later because it didn't take very long to realize that I needed to do an anthropology YouTube video about this so without further Ado let's get into the show and into my thoughts because I know that's why you're all here okay so ancient apocalypse is a docu-series that was released on Netflix in early to mid-november of 2022 that basically follows a journalist named Graham Hancock who goes to all these different archaeological sites basically looking for evidence of a mysterious intelligent society that has been left out from our archeology textbooks and is not present in the archaeological record now in this show Graham Hancock freely argues that archeology as it stands today and as a field today does a really really poor job of accurately representing the past now his main theory that comes up again and again throughout the docu series is basically this it's that there was a highly intelligent ancient civilization that dates back to the Ice Age and this ancient civilization was basically wiped out due to some cataclysm some catastrophic event wiped out this entire or almost entire population of highly intelligent people and the reason that we're not more aware of this is because all of that evidence was then wiped away in the cataclysm and he basically pokes and prods at our current understanding of archeology to prove the presence of this past intelligent Society another thing that I did want to note in this section is a lot of people think that Graham Hancock has kind of come out of the Woodworks for this show and he's like this new shiny archaeological perspective but I did want to note that he's been around for a while one of his older books is called the Fingerprints of the Gods it came out in 1995 and it is basically this exploration of an ancient civilization and how there were people around with intelligent ideas before the archaeological record suggests and so now he is kind of gaining this new you know level of attention because of this Netflix show he was on The Joe Rogan Experience so yeah yes he has been around for a while and he's got lots of very long books from a while ago if you want to go check those out okay so now that you guys know a little bit about the docu-series and a little bit about Graham Hancock's ideas and theories I want to switch gears and talk about my thoughts and my perspectives uh because I think that would be really fun and like I said at the beginning of this video I took notes while watching this show which like I was watching it for pleasure but I literally couldn't help myself and there were two really big things that I noticed about Graham Hancock and his you know scientific method that I really just wanted to lay out on the table right now analyze a little bit and then talk to anybody in the comment section who's willing and so I will be very transparent in saying that I definitely saw some issues with the show and and Grandma Hancock's choices in how he conducted his archaeological research now I do not claim to be an expert in archeology but I feel like I have been very freshly taught archeology and like interacted with archaeologists so yeah let's just talk about it about it so the first thing that I recognized within this show is the extreme prevalence of something called confirmation bias now I have the definition of confirmation bias right here and that is the tendency to interpret new evidence as confirmation of one's existing beliefs or theories now confirmation bias is a term that I learned about in high school um and it's actually a huge issue and a lot of different Fields it's not just archeology or anthropology but it's basically this idea that if you already have like a theory or an idea or a belief that you're looking to prove correct new evidence that presents itself will then get interpreted to back up what you already believe to be true and so that's where it gets its name confirmation bias you're biased in that you're confirming what you already believe to be true so this show opens with Graham Hancock saying hey world I you know am a Trailblazer and I deeply vehemently believe that there was an ancient civilization that the archaeological record doesn't show right and or that I strongly strongly strongly believe that there's a possibility that there was this ancient civilization before you know our archaeological records and I don't disagree that that could be true I don't the archaeological record does a terrible job preserving our past like everything that we have today is literally like a miracle that it preserved because so many things had to go right um but my issue is that everything that he finds all the evidence that he pulls from different sites around the world and all the archaeologists that he talks to all around the world the way he sees that evidence is purely to defend his belief that there was an ancient civilization when I think the better thing to do in science more broadly is to when you get a new set of data you think of you know the many possibilities and the many things that it could mean and so I think because there's so much confirmation bias in this show it was hard for me as the audience to trust our narrator and in science I think that can be a really big problem so yeah confirmation bias not so good and to me felt like the like epitome of Graham Hancock's ideas so the next big thing that I observed in this show I'm going to explain through a little analogy um so anyone who might be familiar with evolutionary biology or biological anthropology might be familiar with something called convergent evolution once again I do have that definition pulled up convergent evolution is the independent evolution of similar features in species of different periods in time in other words convergent evolution is when two unrelated species or two species that do not share a recent common ancestor have developed and evolved similar physiological traits due to their like evolution in the same landscape or environment so that might still be confusing so I'm going to use an example and one of the best examples that I could think of was between a shark and a dolphin now I think a lot of people might assume that a shark and a dolphin actually share a recent common ancestor but this is not at all the case sharks and dolphins are not closely related to each other however when you look at their physiological appearance and their phenotypes they look similar they have a lot in common right they have fins they can survive underwater and this isn't due to a common connection it's because the same solution evolved twice because it was likely the most efficient solution to the issues that these two species faced underwater right like if you need to move underwater Evolution solved this problem with fins now this isn't conscious it's these animals aren't choosing this it's just that's what survived through natural selection again it's a little complicated and kind of hard to explain but I hope that you're getting my point so now we're going to back up a little bit and come back to ancient apocalypse Graham Hancock I keep wanting to say John Hancock but that is so not right Graham Hancock and basically Graham Hancock has this like strong issue with the possibility that two similar ideas could have come to fruition without any connection to each other so I'm basically getting at like the impossibility of like a cultural convergent evolution um and so some examples of this are he discusses in some of his examples um and like archaeological sites that he traveled to all around the world that it seems really really unlikely that two cultures could both think of a flood right like a lot of places around the world have myths that include a flood um that in some way or another hurt their culture or wiped out a good chunk of the population you also have archaeological structures that look very similar from completely different times and geographies and so this coincidence right 2 gram Hancock is so unlikely to the point that he feels like they must be connected to one another um and so for me I view this differently in fact I don't only see it as you know possible I see it as likely that human cultures who have no connection no recent connection to each other could achieve a similar conclusion um both within the structures that they build and the stories that they create um and so I think again humans we live in similar environments right like you have people all around the world who may be you know victims of a flood or fear fire or build a structure that's well supported because there's a good way to do that and I personally do believe that cultures can reach similar conclusions without being connected to each other and so I feel like there is a strong chance of this cultural convergent evolution happening um that Graham Hancock neglects to acknowledge that is possible because humans are very smart we are very intelligent creatures and to to fear a flood is to you know want your survival to build a supported structure is to you know want a structure that's going to last a long time and like be culturally sustaining like I don't know like it just seems like a very strong jump from point A to point B to say there must have been people from prior to the ice age or during the Ice Age that shared this information with all these cultures and they must be like geographically and temporally connected to one another like I just I disagree now finally after my confirmation bias and little convergent evolution rant there was one thing that I wanted to comment on that I actually did appreciate from Graham Hancock and this show and that is that I think it's really easy easy to become okay with what we know now and it's really it's even easier to become complacent with this idea that there's not more to learn um and in all Fields all across Academia I do think that this happens um and there have been many times in history when we think we know all there is to know right like you we think the atom is like the smallest that it can be but then we later come to find that they're subatomic particles and I think archeology will always be like that I think we are going to continue to find things that make us question the timelines that we do have and make us question you know the ways that the cultures around the world and these ancient civilizations are connected to one another and I think the reason that anthropology is a field more broadly is so amazing is because people are questioning the least questionable things right there was an anthropologist and psychologist I believe named Paul broca who said you know so something along the lines of success happens because we or progress happens because we can question the least questionable um and I think Graham Hancock does a really great idea he's saying well this is what we think right and what if that's not quite right you know what if there's things that didn't Preserve in the archaeological record which we know for a fact that there are many many things that did not preserve in the archaeological record um and I just think he does a wonderful job questioning you know and poking and prodding at these ideas um and so again like I think his argument is incredibly flawed I think you can do the right thing and question what we know to be true but then to go as far as he does is just not it but again that is my One Singular perspective if you guys have varying opinions or different observations that you picked up from this show please let me know I had more but like I'm looking at my camera and I've literally already been talking for so long um so yeah I think that's all I have to say about actually I know that's not all not all I have to say about ancient apocalypse but it's all I have to say today um once again I watched some amazing reviews some being a history with Kaylee and then also archeology tube go check them out um if you want to hear some more opinions from pretty smart educated people um but yeah that's all for now if you guys want to learn more about anthropology I have a bunch of other videos on my channel so go check those out and I will see you all next Sunday alright you guys bye foreign "
