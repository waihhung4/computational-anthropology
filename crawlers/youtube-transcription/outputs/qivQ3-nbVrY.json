"when theorizing about how to use weapons like these the shield in this axe we often forget one very important tool in our toolbox anthropology hi folks Mattis here scholar gladiatoria now very often when we're looking at things like this we look at European archaeology we look at experimental archaeology reenactment essentially where we make Recreations of the objects and we have a go with them we spar with them and this kind of stuff and of course we look at hea sources that is the actual treatises or manuals or some people call them uh for the fighting systems of Europe however they only date from The 14th Century onwards and this is a great big problem when we're looking at Viking or Norman era weapons or indeed the ancient world uh like Greece or Egypt or Rome so when we come into these periods and we've got different weapons we've got different mindsets different cultures religions languages and geographies and of course you know a big different time period very often the assumptions that we make based on later periods for example 15th 16th century treatises they might function very very differently back in the 9th century or the first century or the fifth century BC uh and of course some of these places that these people fought people um like Alexander the Great fought all over Asia Minor and all the way to India and of course the Egyptians the Romans and the Greeks fought in what's now the Middle East and North Africa um and so you know we we're quite separated from the source material as it were and the way that they may have used things so without beating around the bush there is another important tool in our toolbox and that is as any good archaeologist will tell you anthropology that is looking at the existing or relatively recent documented practices of other people in other parts of the world it could be looking at mauy fighting systems using various types of um club or it could be looking at spe Spear and shield systems in certain parts of Africa or indeed South America or southeast Asia or India it could go all over the world and this is a very I think underappreciated on channels like mine element to studying these things now I as you know I am a former archaeologist and my my degree is is in archaeology but I did units in anthropology and you know we looked at combat on the trob Bri and islands for example they got very characteristic types of clubs and looking at this type of tribal Warfare I think is really really important when we're looking at prehistory or indeed documented history where we just don't have a lot of technical details about how people use their weapons so I'm only going to give one example in this video cuz I want to keep it pretty concise that that's right I really am going to keep it concise today and that is this fantastic video here which is showing people in North Africa it says uh West Africa but I think it's probably North Africa and they are TW eggs and the tweg are known for fence uh practicing a fencing system essentially with The Sword and the shield now they actually have different types of shields they've also got small Shields but what we can see here are large Shields now I have got a smaller Shield this is actually Somalian but the tar have a similar typee it is essentially boss gripped the grips have come off it but they're there much like an Indian dial so you hold it in the middle like a large Buckler and this is made of animal hide and is quite thick and they fence with um sticks now I'll come back to that in a second we actually find similar videos from the Sudan where we can find um groups like The Hower for example uh what commonly known as dervishes um practicing with their type of sword um which which is called a cascara and their type of Shield which again is actually not dissimilar to one of these but it has more of a um noted uh boss in the center and they have their own fencing systems and they're not all the same so what we see the twareg doing is not necessarily the same it's got some similarities some parallels but it's not the same as what um the beijia for example are doing in the Sudan so they do have different tribal fighting systems different tribal weapons even to the point that a cascara is different ref to the tware tuuba and this is a tuuba now what you can see in this video is actually people um practicing for the use of a large Shield bigger bigger than this one and in fact we can tell from the French description that The Shield is made of antelope hide funnily enough it looks a bit like the cow pattern Shields that we see in uh Ancient Greek art in the really early uh Greek representations those large kind of fig great Shields that we see interesting is there a connection there I don't know I'm not going to postulate but it's interesting that they practice fencing with these large Shields and with a tuuba um but instead of using a TBA they use a stick now this is the first point I want to raise in hea in a lot of modern martial arts we tend to use things which look quite sword likee okay and we TR tend to replace whether it's Spears swords axes whatever we want the weapon to look like the real weapon which is a little bit of a reenactor ISM because when we look at actual tribal cultures who literally I mean this is from the 1920s that video they were still fighting like that with those weapons you know and they had been for hundreds of years and what did they practice with a stick because it's a safe replacement and this was used also in medieval Europe the Romans of course used wooden sticks for practicing with um and we know they were used in the Viking period as well well and later on they were known as waster wooden swords or just a stick just a good old common Garden Ash or Willow stick with a bit of flex in it it will hurt but it won't break bones it won't injure it will just give a nasty wealth much like the traditional British single stick or the French Lan um so this is very much a traditional thing so taking your Shield um I just grab the Norman Shield cuz it's here and this undoubtedly was one of the most common ways of practicing was with your Shield at and not doing too much damage really obviously not just smashing your friend in the face with it and practicing with your stick and your shield and this was fundamentally how most people learned swordsmanship they didn't go to swordsmanship school they didn't use fedish or blunt swords they just used a stick right so that's the first thing we can take away from it but the second thing is if we look at these videos and it's amazing these videos exist because of course film came along just in time to capture some of this stuff we can see recognizable techniqu so one of the things about a large Shield is it covers you high and low and from side to side so it's very difficult to get around the shield now when we spar with shields inevitably you find the two main targets you find yourself going for are the head and the leg so high and low you can't get around the sides very easily unless you're thrusting around with a spit or a Gladius or whatever but you need to be close in to do that but generally speaking if you're standing out at fencing distance as we see these guys then you are off from going high and low and here we can actually see recognizable techniques they're trying to they're trying to get over like a shle how essentially in German long sword over the top of the shield but they're very often coming down at the lower leg down at the ankle we also find archaeological in Europe um backup kind of support for this being very common with Shield fighting both at visby but also at Stanford bridge where there's lots of wounds to the legs obviously if you're using a large uh round Shield or even a Shield then the legs are one of the things you can get at um and we can see recognizable techniques in here where sometimes you'll see the person pretend to go high and in one case we can see I think what's probably a double faint pretend to go high pretend to go low and then do a symbolic hit to the person's head to show that you could have got them in the head and they're not actually hitting each other because they're just playing around they're just having some fun they're just training uh obviously if they were training in a bit more Earnest or having a competition or someone had a bit of a grudge match or trying to prove a point they'd probably lay their heads on and they'd uh cause some blood but they wouldn't kill each other because ultimately they are a group they are a tribe A nation they are there to get better at fighting their enemies not to kill each other hopefully so I'm going to wrap it up there and small simple video really to say we can learn a lot from anthropology both written accounts artistic accounts there's some very good ones of those we might look at in future videos but this beautiful resource of filmed early 20th century examples of tribal martial arts practice is a real um is a real gold mine um of information and we really should sometimes when we're looking at ancient and medieval weapons refer a little bit more to this type of anthropological resource because it's really really good stuff and it reminds of of some simple things about how great a stick is as a practice weapon um and also basically how playing and sports are often the foundation of martial arts and actually enable the practice of it safely without hurting each other anyway thanks a lot for watching I hope I see you back on the channel really soon cheers folks thanks for watching we've got extra videos on patreon please give our Facebook a like And subscribe if you haven't already cheers folks "
